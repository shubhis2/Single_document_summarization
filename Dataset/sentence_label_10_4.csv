21,"""Our data suggest that betanin, a compound in beet extract, shows some promise as an inhibitor of certain chemical reactions in the brain that are involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease,"" said Li-June Ming from University of South Florida.",1
21,"""This is just a first step, but we hope that our findings will encourage other scientists to look for structures similar to betanin that could be used to synthesise drugs that could make life a bit easier for those who suffer from this disease,"" said Ming, who presented the research at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society ACS ).Scientists are still trying to figure out what causes this progressive and irreversible brain disorder.However, one prime suspect is beta-amyloid, a sticky protein fragment, or peptide, that accumulates in the brain, disrupting communication between brain cells called neurons.Much of this damage occurs, Ming said, when beta-amyloid attaches itself to metals such as iron or copper.These metals can cause beta-amyloid peptides to misfold and bind together in clumps that can promote inflammation and oxidation - a process similar to rusting - in nearby neurons, eventually killing them.Previous research conducted by other scientists suggests that beetroot juice can improve oxygen flow to the ageing brain and possibly improve cognitive performance.Ming and colleagues wanted to find out if betanin, a beet compound used in commercial dyes that readily binds to metals, could block the effects of copper on beta-amyloid and, in turn, prevent the misfolding of these peptides and the oxidation of neurons.They conducted a series of experiments involving 3,5 di-tert-butylcatechol, or DTBC.The scientists measured the oxidative reaction of DTBC when exposed to beta-amyloid only, beta-amyloid bound to copper, and copper-bound beta-amyloid in a mixture containing betanin.On its own, beta-amyloid caused little or no oxidation of DTBC, researchers said.",1

36,"""More and more, we are learning that Ceres is a complex, dynamic world that may have hosted a lot of liquid water in the past, and may still have some underground,"" said Julie Castillo-Rogez, Dawn project scientist based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California.Researchers led by Anton Ermakov, a postdoctoral researcher at JPL, used shape and gravity data measurements from the Dawn mission to determine the internal structure and composition of Ceres.The research supports the possibility that Ceres is geologically active - if not now, then it may have been in the recent past.Three craters - Occator, Kerwan and Yalode - and Ceres' solitary tall mountain, Ahuna Mons, are all associated with ""gravity anomalies,"" researchers said.This means discrepancies between the scientists' models of Ceres' gravity and what Dawn observed in these four locations can be associated with subsurface structures.Researchers led by Roger Fu at Harvard University in the US investigated the strength and composition of Ceres' crust and deeper interior by studying the dwarf planet's topography.By modelling how Ceres' crust flows, Fu and colleagues found it is likely a mixture of ice, salts, rock and an additional component believed to be a clathrate hydrate.A clathrate hydrate is a cage of water molecules surrounding a gas molecule.",1
36,"This structure is 100 to 1,000 times stronger than water ice, despite having nearly the same density.The researchers believe Ceres once had more pronounced surface features, but they have smoothed out over time.This type of flattening of mountains and valleys requires a high-strength crust resting on a more deformable layer, which Fu and colleagues interpret to contain a little bit of liquid.",1
37,"WASHINGTON: Western Asia is the most likely spot where modern humans first encountered and had sexual rendezvous with a different hominid species - the Neanderthals, a study suggests.When the ancestors of modern humans migrated out of Africa , they passed through the Middle East and Turkey before heading deeper into Asia and Europe.",1
37,"At this important crossroads, it is thought that they encountered and had sexual rendezvous with the Neanderthals.Genomic evidence shows that this ancient interbreeding occurred, and Western Asia is the most likely spot where it happened.Researchers at the University at Buffalo (UB) in the US explored the legacy of these interspecies trysts, with a focus on Western Asia, where the first relations may have occurred.",1
37,"The research, published in the journal Genome Biology and Evolution, analysed the genetic material of people living in the region today, identifying DNA sequences inherited from Neanderthals.",1
37,"""As far as human history goes, this area was the stepping stone for the peopling of all of Eurasia,"" said Omer Gokcumen, assistant professor at UB College of Arts and Sciences.",0
37,"""This is where humans first settled when they left Africa.",1
37,It may be where they first met Neanderthals.,0
37,"From the standpoint of genetics, it is a very interesting region,"" said Gokcumen.Scientists analysed 16 genomes belonging to people of Turkish descent.",1
37,"""Within these genomes, the areas where we see relatively common Neanderthal introgression are in genes related to metabolism and immune system responses,"" said Recep Ozgur Taskent, a PhD candidate at UB.",0
37,"""Broadly speaking, these are functions that can have an impact on health,"" said Taskent.For example, one DNA sequence that originated from Neanderthals includes a genetic variant linked to celiac disease.",0
37,Another includes a variant tied to a lowered risk of malaria.,0
37,"The relations that our ancestors had with Neanderthals tens of thousands of years ago may continue to exert an influence on our well-being today, Gokcumen said.In addition to exploring the specific functions of genetic material that the Turkish population inherited from Neanderthals, the study also examined the Neanderthals' influence on human populations in Western Asia more broadly.However, the research shows that people living in this area today have relatively little Neanderthal DNA compared to people in other parts of the world.",0
37,"The team analysed genomic data from dozens of Western Asian individuals and observed that, on average, with a few exceptions, these populations carry less Neanderthal DNA than Europeans, Central Asians and East Asians.The differences in Neanderthal ancestry between Western Asian and other populations may be due to the region's unique position in human history, Taskent added.",0
38,"WASHINGTON: Corals may have developed a preference for consuming plastic bits, putting them at risk of being choked by the indigestible materials, a study has found.Scientists have long known that marine animals mistakenly eat plastic debris because the tiny bits of floating plastic might look like prey.The study of plastic ingestion by corals by researchers from Duke University in the US suggests there may be an additional reason for the potentially harmful behaviour.Visual cues, such as a resemblance to prey, do not factor into the appeal because corals have no eyes, researchers said.",0
38,"""Corals in our experiments ate all types of plastics but preferred unfouled microplastics by a threefold difference over microplastics covered in bacteria,"" said Austin S Allen, a PhD student at Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment.",1
38,"""This suggests the plastic itself contains something that makes it tasty,"" said Allen.",1
38,"""When plastic comes from the factory, it has hundreds of chemical additives on it.",1
38,"Any one of these chemicals or a combination of them could be acting as a stimulant that makes plastic appealing to corals,"" said Alexander C Seymour, from Duke's Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Center.Further research will be needed to identify the specific additives that make the plastic so tasty to corals and determine if the same chemicals act as feeding stimulants to other marine species, researchers said.Microplastics, tiny pieces of weathered plastic less than five millimetres in diameter, began accumulating in the oceans four decades ago and are now ubiquitous in the marine environment.They pose a major threat to foraging sea animals, including many species of birds, turtles, fish, marine mammals and invertebrates.Since plastic is largely indigestible, it can lead to intestinal blockages, create a false sense of fullness or reduce energy reserves in animals that consume it.",0
38,"""About eight per cent of the plastic that coral polyps in our study ingested was still stuck in their guts after 24 hours,"" said Allen.The biological effects of most of these compounds are still unknown, but some, such as phthalates, are confirmed environmental estrogens and androgens - hormones that affect sex determination.Researchers conducted their two-part study using corals collected from waters off the North Carolina coast.In their first experiment, they offered small amounts of eight different types of microplastics to the corals to see if the animals would eat the bite-sized bits versus other similarly-sized items offered to them, such as clean sand.",0
38,"""We found that the corals ate all of the plastic types we offered and mostly ignored sand,"" Allen said.In the second experiment, they put groups of coral into separate feeding chambers.",1
38,"Each group was offered the same amount weathered plastics for a 30-minute period.Some groups got only particles of unfouled microplastics while others got only particles of weathered microplastics fouled with a bacterial biofilm.This experiment verified that the corals would eat both types of plastic, but preferred the clean type by a three-to- one margin.The researchers hope their findings will encourage scientists to explore the role taste plays in determining why marine organisms ingest microplastics.",1
39,"LONDON: The brain network involved in daydreaming plays an important role in allowing us to perform routine tasks efficiently, without investing too much time and energy, a study has found.Scientists at the University of Cambridge in the UK showed that far from being just 'background activity', the 'default mode network' involved in daydreaming may be essential to helping us perform tasks on autopilot.The findings have relevance to brain injury, particularly following traumatic brain injury, where problems with memory and impulsivity can substantially compromise social reintegration.They may also have relevance for mental health disorders, such as addiction, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, where particular thought patterns drive repeated behaviours, and the mechanisms of anaesthetic agents and other drugs on the brain.Previously, scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine had found that a collection of brain regions appeared to be more active during such states of rest.This network was named the 'default mode network' (DMN).",1
39,"While it has since been linked to, among other things, daydreaming, thinking about the past, planning for the future, and creativity, its precise function is unclear.In the new research published in the journal Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, scientists showed that the DMN plays an important role in allowing us to switch to 'autopilot' once we are familiar with a task.In the study, 28 volunteers took part in a task while lying inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.",0
39,"Functional MRI (fMRI) measures changes in brain oxygen levels as a proxy for neural activity.Participants were shown four cards and asked to match a target card to one of these cards.There were three possible rules - matching by colour, shape or number.",1
39,"Volunteers were not told the rule, but rather had to work it out for themselves through trial and error.The most interesting differences in brain activity occurred when comparing the two stages of the task - acquisition (where the participants were learning the rules by trial and error) and application (where the participants had learned the rule and were now applying it).During the acquisition stage, the dorsal attention network, which has been associated with the processing of attention-demanding information, was more active.However, in the application stage, where participants utilised learned rules from memory, the DMN was more active.In this stage, the stronger the relationship between activity in the DMN and in regions of the brain associated with memory, such as the hippocampus, the faster and more accurately the volunteer was able to perform the task.This suggested that during the application stage, the participants could efficiently respond to the task using the rule from memory.",0
39,"""Rather than waiting passively for things to happen to us, we are constantly trying to predict the environment around us,"" said Deniz Vatansever , former student at the University of Cambridge.",1
39,"""Our evidence suggests it is the default mode network that enables us do this.",1
39,"It is essentially like an autopilot that helps us make fast decisions when we know what the rules of the environment are,"" said Vatansever, who is now based at the University of York ""So for example, when you are driving to work in the morning along a familiar route, the default mode network will be active, enabling us to perform our task without having to invest lots of time and energy into every decision,"" he said.",1
40,"TORONTO: Consumption of psychedelic drugs such as magic mushrooms or LSD may decrease the likelihood of antisocial criminal behaviour, a study claims.Researchers, including those from University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus in Canada , used data obtained from the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health to explore the connection between the use of classic psychedelic substances and criminal behaviour among more than 480,000 adult respondents from the past 13 years.The study, published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, found that respondents who have used psychedelic drugs had 27 per cent decreased odds of larceny or theft, and 22 per cent decreased odds of arrest for a violent crime in the past year.At the same time, lifetime use of other illicit substances was generally associated with increased odds of criminal behaviour, researchers said.",1
40,"""The development of innovative and effective interventions to prevent criminal behaviour is an obvious priority,"" said Peter Hendricks from University of Alabama in the US.",1
40,"""Our findings suggest the protective effects of classic psychedelic use are attributable to genuine reductions in antisocial behaviour rather than reflecting improved evasion of arrest,"" he said.The positive effects associated with classic psychedelic use appear to be reliable.",1
40,"Given the costs of criminal behaviour, the potential represented by this treatment paradigm is significant, researchers said.",1

44,NEW DELHI: Apple recently launched its iOS 10 operating system for all users having supported iPhone and iPad devices.,1
44,"And despite facing some initial glitches, iOS 10’s early adoption rate has been recorded to be higher than that of iOS 9 in the same time frame.As recorded by the Mixpanel website, iOS 10 reached 14.45% of eligible devices in the first 24 hours of its release.",1
44,"In comparison, iOS 9 was on 12.60% of eligible device within 24 hours of it being released for all users.It is too early to guess when iOS 10 will be on about 50% of all eligible devices.",1
44,"As per the website, iOS 8 reached 50% adoption rate in a month, while iOS 9 hit the same spot within 12 days.",1
44,"We believe that the adoption rate for iOS 10 would’ve been even faster, had it not encountered the installation-related bugs early during rollout.For those unaware, iOS 10 was reported to have caused iPhones and iPads to freeze after they were updated with the latest OS, within hours of its public release.",0
44,"Several users took to Twitter and Facebook to vent their ire as downloading the update led them to factory reset their devices, wiping all saved data on devices.",0

45,Gadgets and technology help us in doing nearly everything better and staying fit is no exception.,0
45,"Whether you’re a long-term fitness buff or just getting started on the path of getting into shape, a fitness tracker is one of the best gadgets one can get.",0
45,"These wrist-worn (generally) devices can not only track human body’s vital signs like heart rate, but also log fitness-related data such as step count, calories burnt, sleep activity and more.",0
45,"This data can be then used to create personalized fitness goals and diet plans, thus leading to a healthier lifestyle.When it comes to fitness trackers, Fitbit is a name that needs no introduction.",0
45,The company recently launched two new products – Charge 2 and Flex 2.,0
45,"Of these, the more expensive Charge 2 is an upgrade to the Fitbit Charge HR, which is now almost two years old.We tested the Fitbit Charge 2 for a few days, using it for tracking everything from sleeping patterns to daily walks.",1
45,"So, is the Fitbit Charge 2 and its promise of a healthier lifestyle any good, especially at an asking price of Rs 14,999?",1
45,Let’s find out.Fitbit Charge 2 is essentially comprises two components – tracker module and wrist band.,0
45,The wrist band is made from a flexible elastomer material and comes with a stainless-steel buckle for fastening the Charge 2 around the wrist.,0
45,"The outer side of the band is textured, while the underside is smooth.",0
45,"The wrist band is removable and can be swapped with one of the many designer bands, which have to be purchased separately.",0
45,"Since it’s sweat proof, the wrist band doesn’t irritate the skin even when the Charge 2 is worn on the wrist for an extended period of time.As for the tracker module itself, its frame is made from stainless steel.",0
45,"On the top rests a slightly curved black glass, under which hides a large (at least as compared to the Charge HR) OLED display.",0
45,"The left and right sides of the frame are chamfered and a navigation button lies on the left, the only button on the Fitbit Charge 2.Flip the Charge 2 and you see the optical heart rate tracker with two flashing LEDs (one each at the top and bottom of the tracking chip).",0
45,"There are also three charging contacts at the bottom, which work by making contact with the pins on the clip-on charger.",0
45,"Other important components include a 3-axis accelerometer, an altimeter and a vibration motor.Overall, we found the design and build quality of the Fitbit Charge 2 to be really good.",0
45,"While the tracker module is quite solid, the wrist band is flexible yet sturdy enough to withstand daily wear and tear.Fitbit Charge 2 comes with a touch-capable OLED screen that automatically turns on when the wearer flicks the wrist, although this functionality can be disabled in the Fitbit app.",0
45,"The display can also be turned on with a double-tap or by pressing the navigation button on the side.Though the display shows time and date by default, users also have the option to choose from the various styles available.",0
45,"To change the display style, simply select it from the ‘Clock Display’ option in the Fitbit app and sync the tracker with the app.",0
45,"The display can be single-tapped repeatedly to flip through daily activity stats like calories burnt and floors climbed.As for the navigation, pressing the navigation button on the left repeatedly moves through various menu options (e.g.",0
45,"Heart Rate, Stopwatch).",0
45,"While a menu item is active, its related options can be cycled through by tapping the display.",0
45,"Lastly, long-pressing the side navigation button starts/stops the function associated with a menu item (e.g.",0
45,"Run).Interestingly, on-screen options can also be shuffled through by tapping anywhere on the wristband.Fitbit Charge 2 works in tandem with the Fitbit app (available on all platforms).",0
45,You also need to create a free Fitbit account (if you don’t already have one) to login to the app.,0
45,"The account/profile creation includes entering essential body statistics like weight and height, as these are required for setting up personalized meal plans and weight goals.Once you login with your Fitbit account, it’s generally easy to pair the Charge 2 with the smartphone over Bluetooth using the app.",0
45,"But sometimes, the tracker does take a bit of a trial-and-error to get paired up.",0
45,"After pairing, you can simply wear the Charge 2 on the wrist (it can be worn on either of the wrists) and it will start doing its thing.",0
45,The tracker syncs with the smartphone over Bluetooth every time the app is launched.,0
45,It can be manually synchronized as well.,0
45,"Also, the smartphone that Fitbit Charge 2 is paired with needs to be connected to a network so that logged data can be synchronized to your Fitbit account The ‘Dashboard’ is the default landing section of the app.",0
45,"It displays a summarized list of all the metrics that are tracked by Fitbit Charge 2, including steps walked, calories burnt, floors climbed and sleep activity.",1
45,"Tapping on any logged parameter gives its logged values for the past days, with the last week’s data arranged in the form of a bar graph.The primary daily goal is set to steps by default, but can be changed via the tracker settings in the app.",0
45,"All data logs reset automatically at the start of the next day (00:00 hrs).During our extensive testing spanning over the course of almost a week (which included wearing the device almost 24x7), we found the Fitbit Charge 2 to be really good at logging different parameters.",0
45,It detects activities like sleeping automatically and heart rate tracking is reliably accurate.,0
45,"Moreover, step logging is almost real-time.Fitbit Charge 2 comes with ‘guided breathing sessions’ (2min or 5min in length) feature.",0
45,It lets you practice relaxed breathing by guiding you through inhale and exhale actions.,0
45,This is something we liked a lot.There’s also multi-sport tracking built-in.,0
45,"It can track activity when you’re lifting weights, running on the treadmill, cycling or even working out generally.",0
45,All this data is then synced to the companion app .,0
45,"In our testing, multi-sport tracking worked as expected.One feature we’d like to talk about is ‘move reminders’.",0
45,"To help you stay through the entire day, Fitbit Charge 2 vibrates on an hourly basis, encouraging you to take at least 250 steps (roughly equivalent to a few minutes of walking).",0
45,"Of course, the reminders can be customized from the tracker’s settings in the app.Fitbit Charge 2’s ‘connected GPS’ functionality uses the GPS in your smartphone (provided it’s the same the tracker is paired with) to track your route, thus helping in getting real-time statistics like distance travelled.",0
45,"During our testing, the feature worked quite well.",0
45,"That said, how accurate it is depends on numerous factors such as the quality of GPS satellite lock-in and the connection between the smartphone and tracker.If any of your friends uses a Fitbit fitness tracker, you can compare your fitness stats and take part in challenges together.",0
45,"However, we weren’t able to test this feature out.A really useful feature of the Fitbit Charge 2 is smartphone notifications.",1
45,"These include alerts about calls, text messages (SMS, WhatsApp and Hangouts) and calendar events.",0
45,"In our testing, notifications worked exceptionally well.",0
45,"Consequently, we had to check our smartphone less often.",0
45,"But even with that, we found the alerts functionality to be limited.",0
45,"Competing products like the Garmin vivosmart HR are much better in this regard, offering not only email and social media alerts, but also the ability to control music playback and some other devices.Coming to the battery life, we found it to be really good.",0

51,"NEW DELHI: Instant messaging platform WhatsApp today opposed in Delhi High Court a plea alleging that privacy of its users has been threatened by a new privacy policy announced by Facebook , saying regulations were in place and the latter does not have access to any data as it provides end-to-end encryption WhatsApp had made extensive changes to its privacy policy on August 25, the first time since it was acquired by Facebook, giving users the option of sharing their account information with the social network giant.",0
51,"The messaging service gave its users 30 days till September 25 to opt out of the policy.The submission was made before a bench of chief justice G Rohini and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal, who were hearing a PIL against WhatsApp's recent decision to share user data with parent company Facebook.Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for WhatsApp, said there are government regulations in place and the application does not share users private messages, contents, photos or data with Facebook.He said WhatsApp only shares a user's name and the phone number with Facebook .",0

54,What's keeping you from buying that smartphone you had set your eyes on for ages?,0
54,"If you're a student or a young professional, chances are that you simply don't have enough to spare for the buy .",0
54,"While the former does not have regular channels of income, the latter may struggle to save enough after paying the bills.",0
54,A convenient solution is to pay it off in EMIs.,0
54,"However, this is easier said than done, since bank loans come with their own set of conditions and in-store EMI schemes require credit cards and offer only limited options in terms of inventory .",1
54,"Finomena , a startup with a unique system of verification and loan approval, offers an alternative.",0
54,"It is a customer-experience driven fintech platform that enables inclusion by offering easy access to credit for people who have never taken a loan before, and hence do not have a credit score .Moreover, it allows you to register online and simply browse ecommerce sites and choose the gadget you want.After that you can choose from the financing and EMI options and apply with a single click.The phrase 'financial inclusion' evokes the idea of a section of people without access to basic banking services.",0
54,This is why one of the government's primary initiatives in facilitating financial inclusion has been to open bank accounts through the Jan Dhan Yojana .,0
54,"However, a bank account alone does not ensure access to credit.",0
54,"A section that gets largely left out in terms of access to loans and credit cards, despite holding bank accounts, includes students, young professionals and the self-employed.More than 75% of Indians do not have a traditional credit bureau score.",0
54,"""We cannot rely too much on traditional models to gauge the credit score of a potential client as traditional data for these people doesn't exist.They might not have traditional income proof but with the power of a smartphone, they are leaving a massive digital footprint,"" says Abhishek Garg, cofounder, Finomena.",0
54,"The platform uses this big data to create machine learning-based risk and credit scoring systems that take into account over 20,000 data points to assess the credit worthiness of a borrower.Shashank Singh, 26, may be a lawyer at the Delhi High Court, but securing a loan from a bank was nearly impossible.",0
54,"""As an advocate, my income fluctuates month to month , which is why banks are reluctant to issue credit cards to me or approve my loan applications,"" he says.",0
54,"When he wanted to purchase an iPhone 6S, Singh approached several banks for a loan, but was turned down each time.",0
54,He started looking for alternatives and chanced upon Finomena.,0
54,"""They had a one-on-one conversation with me about their processes, and sent someone to pick up the documents from my home.",0
54,"My loan was approved within a day,"" says Singh.A credit score is a three digit numeric summary of your entire credit history.",1
54,It is prepared based on the information provided in your Credit Information Report.,0
54,The credit score normally ranges between 300 and 900.Most banks and financial institutions rely on this figure to determine the credit worthiness of potential bor rowers.,1
54,"In fact, 79% of the loans approved are for individuals with a score over 750.However, this is a setback for the young unbanked population since they may not have a credit score at all, resulting in a vicious cycle.Finomena's founders, Riddhi Mittal and Abhishek Garg, did extensive research about loan disbursal mechanisms and the demographic of borrowers, which revealed that most banks and NBFCs steer clear of the students and young professionals because traditional modes of KYC data collection don't work for them.",0
54,"“Most of our customers are in their first jobs, or self-employed with no traditional proof,“ says Mittal.While there are a few options available to customers for buying high-end gadgets on an EMI basis, they often have hidden clauses.",0
54,In-store EMI programmes require the customer to have a credit card.,1
54,"However, less than 2% Indians are credit card holders.These schemes also have set tenures and EMI amounts payable by the customer.",1
54,"Finomena has taken it one step further by introducing FMIs or flexible monthly installments.Viren Makwana, an IT student who also has a part-time job, was pleasantly surprised to learn that he could choose the down-payment amount, as well as how much he wanted to pay each month for buying a laptop.The 21-year-old settled for a monthly payment of Rs 2,000 to pay off the loan over a 12-month period.",0

61,"Last week, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) imposed a $21.17 million fine on Googlefor “search bias” and abuse of its dominant position.",1
61,The Commission found that Google through its search design had placed its commercial flight search function at a prominent position on the search results page to the disadvantage of other businesses trying to gain market access.,1
61,"I was intrigued by this order because Google is not in the travel business, and I couldn’t understand how its behaviour could be anti-competitive unless it was using its search engine to steal customers away from competitors.",0
61,I decided to try things out for myself.,0
61,I typed “flight” into the Google’s search box and scrolled through the results page.,0
61,"After the obligatory advertisements at the top, I noticed a box with a link to a page called ‘Google Flights’.",1
61,"When I clicked on it, I was taken to a new page packed with destination suggestions and best price offers.",0
61,It even had a neat interface that allowed me to hover over a spot on the map and find out how much it would cost to fly there.,0
61,I realised why this irritated vertical search engines.,0
61,But I still couldn’t understand what was anti-competitive about all this.,0
61,"After all, if Google was going to use its search prowess to steal customers away, it needs to sell tickets.",0
61,"I couldn’t imagine why a global search behemoth, whose business model was designed around a highly efficient but entirely automated ad auction platform, would want to have anything to do with a low-margin, high-touch business such as flight ticketing.",0
61,So I decided to find out for myself and book a flight.,0
61,"I selected a destination, travel dates and flight options and looked at the options I was given.",0
61,The first option was to buy the ticket directly from the airline but every other option pointed me to various vertical search engines — taking me right back to where I started.,0
61,I was right.,0
61,Google was not in the travel business.,0
61,"All it had done was devise a better, more intuitive way to organise search results in order to improve the user experience.",0
61,Google Flight is not a new business vertical that books your tickets for you.,1
61,All it does is offer a price comparison accessible directly from the search page of all available flights to a given destination.,1
61,This is exactly the sort of innovation that Internet companies should be encouraged to do: finding new ways to improve their offerings as long as they do not adversely affect the interests of customers or competitors.,0
61,I can’t see what is anti-competitive about that.,0
61,"After all, any customer who wants to book a flight from among the search results served up on the Google Flight page has to do so from the vertical search engines that were

complaining that they were being sidelined.",0
61,"It’s disappointing that CCI, which took such a progressive view in the recent Ola case, did not apply the same rationale to address these nuances in the Google decision.",0
61,"Competition laws may have been designed for the offline world but when we use it to regulate large online players, it is imperative that we reorient our thinking so that we can better address the challenges of the big data age.",0
61,"Today, customers benefit from network effects.",0
61,The larger an Internet company grows the better it can serve its customers by leveraging data at scale to offer features and services that are otherwise impossible to achieve.,0
61,"If competition law is to be deployed to the benefit of the end consumer, we must allow Internet companies to better leverage the advantages of scale.",0
61,High market share and dominance are no longer antitrust concerns.,0
61,What is important is the conduct of a dominant market player and whether it is using its dominance to stifle innovation and/or competition.,0
61,"The dissenting opinion in the Google case seems to have held this view: they accused the majority of having “…woven a narrative of hypothetical anti–competitive foreclosure”, referring to the extent to which the majority opinion has been based on the anticipation of harm without any evidence to that effect.",0
61,It is unfortunate for the evolution of Indian competition jurisprudence that they could not persuade the majority.,0

62,"On Tuesday, the world’s most powerful rocket ever was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States.",1
62,"SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy was successfully tested on its first attempt, an achievement that is important for two reasons: One, Falcon Heavy, which is essentially an assembling of three Falcon 9s (SpaceX’s workhorse), is now way ahead — and by ahead, really ahead — of competition in the so-called heavy-lift category.",1
62,"It can place about 64 tonnes payload, which is more than twice the payload of its nearest competitor ULA’s Delta 4 Heavy, in a single launch into the Lower Earth Orbit (LEO).",0
62,The scientific and commercial windows this opens are many.,0
62,"It will enable the launch of heavier payloads, encourage the private sector to participate in space-related missions, and also, as seen across social media, get planetary scientists discussing its impact.",0
62,"Simply put, Falcon Heavy is a game changer in the space race.",1
62,"Second, SpaceX , a company promoted by Elon Musk, has shown that it can not only easily reach the LEO (and go beyond), but has also done this using reusable boosters which will drastically cut the costs of launching satellites.",0
62,"At an estimate of about $90 million per launch, it already costs only about a fourth the current rate for launches in that payload category.",0
62,It’s not that the launch was a complete success.,0
62,There were a few hiccups.,0
62,"Mr Musk’s Tesla Roadster, the mock payload on Falcon Heavy, which was supposed to revolve around the Sun at a distance of the Mars’ orbit, has overshot its trajectory and is now in the asteroid belt, between Mars and Jupiter and precariously close to the Ceres’ orbit.",0
62,"The second hiccup — one which should be bothering Mr Musk more — is the failure of the main booster to dock on the drone ship, showing that the rocket’s ocean-borne landing is yet to be perfected.",0
62,"With Tuesday’s launch, Mr Musk proved that he is not only an entrepreneur, but also a great public relations tactician (and, of course, fan-boy par excellence) .",1
62,"The Roadster can be seen as space junk, because except for its novelty factor, there’s no scientific or academic purpose for sending an automobile into space.",0
62,"Adding to this is the fact that the mannequin in the driver’s seat is wearing a SpaceX spacesuit, and David Bowie’s Space Oddity is playing in endless loop on the radio in the car, and the glove compartment has a copy of Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy.",0
62,"The car’s dashboard also has a message that says “Don’t Panic”, the enduring tenet of the Hitchhiker books.",0

63,"The venture capitalist and Netscape founder Marc Andreessen wrote a widely read essay in 2011 entitled, “Why Software Is Eating the World.” But we didn’t take Andreessen seriously; we thought it was only a metaphor.",0

63,I used to be a technology optimist.,0
63,"During a 35-year career investing in the best and brightest of Silicon Valley, I was lucky enough to be part of the personal computer, mobile communications, Internet, and social networking industries.",0

63,Each new wave of technology increased productivity and access to knowledge.,0
63,Each new platform was easier to use and more convenient.,0
63,Technology powered globalisation and economic growth.,0
63,"For decades, it made the world a better place.",0
63,We assumed it always would.,0
63,"Then came 2016, when the Internet revealed two dark sides.",0
63,One is related to individual users.,0
63,"Smartphones with LTE mobile infrastructure created the first content-delivery platform that was available every waking moment, transforming the technology industry and the lives of two billion users.",0
63,"With little or no regulatory supervision in most of the world, companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, and Tencent used techniques common in propaganda and casino gambling, such as constant notifications and variable rewards, to foster psychological addiction.",0
63,The other dark side is geopolitical.,0
63,"In the United States, Western Europe, and Asia, Internet platforms, especially Facebook, enable the powerful to inflict harm on the powerless in politics, foreign policy, and commerce.",0
63,Elections across Europe and in the US have repeatedly demonstrated that automated social networks can be exploited to undermine democracy.,0
63,The Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016 also revealed that Facebook provides significant relative advantages to negative messages over positive ones.,0
63,"Authoritarian governments can use Facebook to promote public support for repressive policies, as may be occurring now in Myanmar, Cambodia, the Philippines, and elsewhere.",0
63,"In some cases, Facebook actually provides support to such governments, as it does to all large clients.",0
63,"I am confident that the founders of Facebook, Google, and other major Internet platforms did not intend to cause harm when they adopted their business models.",1
63,"They were young entrepreneurs, hungry for success.",0
63,"They spent years building huge audiences by reorganising the online world around a set of applications that were more personalised, convenient, and easier to use than their predecessors.",0
63,And they made no attempt to monetise their efforts until long after users were hooked.,0
63,"The advertising business models they chose were leveraged by personalisation, which enabled advertisers to target their messages with unprecedented precision.",0
63,"But then came the smartphone, which transformed all media and effectively put Facebook, Google, and a handful of others in control of the information flow to users.",0
63,"The filters that give users “what they want” had the effect of polarising populations and eroding the legitimacy of fundamental democratic institutions (most notably, the free press).",0
63,And the automation that made Internet platforms so profitable left them vulnerable to manipulation by malign actors everywhere – and not just authoritarian governments hostile to democracy.,0
63,"As Andreessen warned us, these companies, with their global ambition and reach, are eating the world economy.",0
63,"In the process, they are adopting versions of Facebook’s corporate philosophy — “move fast and break things” — without regard for the impact on people, institutions, and democracy.",0
63,A large minority of citizens in the developed world inhabits filter bubbles created by these platforms — digital false realities in which existing beliefs become more rigid and extreme.,0
63,"In the US, approximately one-third of the adult population has become impervious to new ideas, including demonstrable facts.",0
63,"Such people are easy to manipulate, a concept that former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris calls “brain hacking”.",0
63,Western democracies are unprepared to deal with this threat.,0
63,"The US has no effective regulatory framework for Internet platforms, and lacks the political will to create one.",1
63,"The European Union has both a regulatory framework and the necessary political will, but neither is adequate to the challenge.",0
63,"The EU’s recent judgment against Google — a record $2.7 billion fine for anti-competitive behaviour — was well conceived, but undersized.",0
63,"Google appealed, and its investors shrugged.",0
63,"It may be a good start, but it was clearly insufficient.",0
63,We are at a critical juncture.,0
63,"Awareness of the risks posed by Internet platforms is growing from a small base, but the convenience of the products and psychological addiction to them are such that it may take a generation to effect change from the user side, as it did with anti-smoking campaigns.",0
63,"Recognition of the corrosive effect of platform monopolies on competition and innovation is greater in Europe than in the US, but no one has found an effective regulatory strategy.",0
63,"Awareness that the platforms can be manipulated to undermine democracy is also growing, but Western governments have yet to devise a defence against it.",0
63,The challenges posed by Internet platform monopolies require new approaches beyond antitrust enforcement.,1
63,We must recognise and address these challenges as a threat to public health.,0
63,"One possibility is to treat social media in a manner analogous to tobacco and alcohol, combining education and regulation.",0
63,"For the sake of restoring balance to our lives and hope to our politics, it is time to disrupt the disrupters.",0

67,"If there is one thing that we cannot do without in the office, it is Google Chrome.",1
67,"One of the most used browser in the world, it’s simplicity and ease of operation play a key role in making it popular.",0
67,"However, did you know that Google Chrome offers more than just a browsing experience?",1
67,"Well, then check out these easy tips and hacks that will optimize your browsing experience.",0
67,"1) Customizing and managing your Chrome profiles

One of the most useful features about using Chrome is that you can create your own login and profile so that Chrome can store information such as browsing history, bookmarks etc.",0
67,"However, did you know you can create multiple profiles?",0
67,"For example, you can have a work profile to use Chrome while in office.",0
67,Chrome keeps information such saved passwords and login- separate for each profile.,1
67,Go to settings and select ‘manage people’.,0
67,"Then, select ‘add other people’.",0
67,"Now, you can create alternate profiles for yourself for different purposes and customize them as per your needs.",0
67,This allows you to use two or more profiles on the same system.,0
67,"2)Recovering forgotten passwords

67,"Sooner or later, we tend to forget our password.",0
67,"However, with this Chrome hack, you can easily recover forgotten passwords.",0
67,"Go to ‘settings’, scroll down and select ‘advance’.",0
67,"Then, select ‘manage passwords’ and you can see the list of passwords and information saved in alphabetical order.",1
67,"If your Gmail is synced, then select ‘passwords.google.com’ and you can recover any forgotten credentials.",0

At times, we accidently end up closing all the tabs opened inChrome or our system just crashes while browsing.",0
67,"In the process, we lose track of all the websites that we were browsing.",0
67,"However, with this hack, you can open all the closed tabs in one go.",0

68,The much-awaited iPhone X is finally here.,0
68,"The smartphone that marks 10th anniversary of the iPhone comes with unique design, edge-to-edge screen and customised version of iOS.",0
68,"The most critical change, however, is the inclusion of Face ID, which replaces the fingerprint scanner-based Touch ID.",0
68,"So, you might be wondering how does one get used to Face ID?",0
68,How does it work?,0
68,Is it convenient and safe?,0
68,"Well, we have been using the iPhone X for last few days here’s how Apple’s futuristic Face ID works.",1
68,What’s Face ID?,0
68,Let’s begin with a very basic question.,0
68,"After all, what is Face ID?",0
68,"Well, it’s essentially a new technique of authenticating user profile to log into the smartphone.",0
68,"While Touch ID scanned your fingerprint, Face ID, as the name implies, scans your face in 360-degree for a 3D map.",1
68,"Technology behind Face ID

Apple has a dedicated setup of sensors, called TrueDepth camera, which facilitate Face ID.",0
68,"These sensors including infrared camera, dot projector, front camera and flood illuminator, are placed on the front-notch on the iPhone X.",0
68,The TrueDepth camera uses infrared wavelength (invisible to the naked eye) to accurately capture your facial details.,0
68,This allows the camera to unlock your phone even in low light and dark conditions.,0
68,"“The TrueDepth camera captures accurate face data by projecting and analyzing over 30,000 invisible dots to create a depth map of your face and also captures an infrared image of your face,” Apple explains on its website.",0
68,"“A portion of the A11 Bionic chip’s neural engine — protected within the Secure Enclave — transforms the depth map and infrared image into a mathematical representation and compares that representation to the enrolled facial data.”

How to Set up Face ID?",0
68,Setting up Face ID on the iPhone X is a bit awkward.,0
68,"Before beginning the setup, ensure the front camera lens isn’t covered or there’s any obstruction between your face and the front camera.",0
68,"The distance between the phone and your face ideally should be about a feet, though Apple says Face ID works best when the device is about an arm’s length or closer.",0
68,"Step 1: To get started, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode (Ensure you’ve already created a passcode for the phone or create one)

Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID and place the phone in front of your face.",0
68,You will see a circular frame on the screen.,0
68,Step 3: Move/adjust your position to fit in that circular frame.,0
68,Step 4: Slowly move your head in clockwise direction.,0
68,Step 5: Repeat the process for the final verification.,0
68,"Once the set up is complete, tap Done.",0
68,What things can you do with Face ID?,0
68,"Besides logging into your iPhone X, you can Face ID to authenticate downloads on iTunes and App Store, pretty much everything that Touch ID does.",1
68,You can also use Face ID to autofill usernames and passwords for compatible websites in Safari.,0
68,You can also sign in to app using this feature.,0
68,"Face ID is also compatible with Apple Pay, though this feature is not available in India.",0
68,Unlock your phone with just a glance.,0
68,"(Apple)

Face ID and user privacy

Apple gives a lot of importance to user privacy.",0
68,"For Face ID, the company says the data collected by facial identification method is encrypted and “never leaves your device and is never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else.” Apple adds that the apps cannot access Face ID data associated with the registered face.",1
68,"“Within supported apps, you can enable Face ID for authentication.",0
68,Apps are only notified as to whether the authentication is successful.,0
68,Users have control over how to use Face ID.,0
68,One can disable Face ID by opening Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Use Face ID for and disable iPhone unlock.,1
68,You can also disable Face ID for other functionalities.,0
68,Is it convenient?,0
68,"Getting used to Face ID takes a bit of time, but not that long as you’d expect.",0
68,"Unlike the iris scanner on the Galaxy Note 8, Face ID doesn’t fire your front camera on the screen.",0
68,Everything that Face ID does is invisible to the human eye.,0
68,"Also, it doesn’t really compel you to hold your phone in front of your face all the times; rather it focuses on your attention (Attention-aware in Applespeak).The good thing is that it works from almost all angles and unlocks the phone with ease.",0
68,It works even if you are wearing glasses or changed your look a bit.,0
68,"There’s a minute bit of struggle when using in low light, but works properly nonetheless.",0

According to MacRumors, the bug had been prevalent throughout iOS 11 beta testing, but gained a wide attention just last week.",0
70,“Any iOS developers will see what is wrong here: the bug is that the animation that lights up the button is blocking touch events until the animation completes.,0

77,"Praise may motivate young adults with autism to exercise more, according to a study.",1
77,The research from the UNC Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute (FPG) also found that praising people with autism by pre-recorded messages through iPhones and iPods shows promise for producing more exercise.,0
77,"“As people with autism age, they tend to exercise less and less than their peers without autism,” said FPG’s Melissa N. Savage, who headed the study.",0
77,"“Previous studies have shown that individuals with autism are at special risk for health challenges like obesity, as well as for secondary conditions like depression and diabetes.”

Savage said that in addition to health benefits that regular physical activity carries for everyone, it also can be especially powerful for people with autism.",0
77,"“Prior research has demonstrated that regular moderate-to-vigorous exercise for people with autism can increase their academic engagement in the classroom,” she explained.",0
77,"“They tend to spend more time on task and display fewer challenging behaviours.”

Due to the benefits of regular physical activity for people with autism, Savage wanted to explore how to increase their engagement in a regular exercise routine through positive reinforcement, a well-established practice for use with people with autism.",0
77,"“With technology use in physical activity becoming more commonplace, it was important to determine its advantages or disadvantages to provide needed support,” Savage said.",0
77,"“We wanted to know under which condition participants would engage in more aerobic activity and which condition they preferred.”

For this small single-subject design study, she implemented an exercise program for three young adults with autism, ages 20-22, and followed their daily progress through multiple sessions under different conditions.",0
77,"While participants were running laps around cones, they heard the same voice either in-person or through headphones on a fixed schedule, delivering various praise statements, such as “Good job running around the cones!” or “You are doing a great job running Mason!” These praise statements incorporated the target behavior (running), which the autism team’s AFIRM online instruction highlights as an important feature of effective reinforcement.",0
77,"“We found that introducing praise statements corresponded with more physical activity for all participants,” Savage said.",1
77,"“The number of laps increased for all of them, regardless of whether they received praise in person or through technology.”

According to Savage, though, the impact of praise on exercise may not have been the most important finding.",0
77,"“When it comes to motivating young adults with autism to exercise, part of the solution may lie in making use of technology,” she said.",0
77,"“Participants who excelled when hearing praise statements through technology also maintained their performances even when we thinned out the praise statements and generalized the exercise to a new setting.”

Savage also said that using technology has several additional advantages.",0
77,"Especially among young adults, cell phones and iPods are popular and carry no stigma.",0
77,Using them for support may also help people with autism feel more independent.,0
77,Relying on technology to deliver praise statements or provide other support also saves time.,1
77,"“In-person praise required much more attention to the participant during intervention, and it was harder to be consistent with the time-based schedule,” she said.",0
77,"“Using the mobile devices required about 5 minutes to record and upload the praise statements, but there wasn’t any additional work needed once that was done.”

Scientists are still trying to figure out what causes this progressive and irreversible brain disorder.",0
78,"However, one prime suspect is beta-amyloid, a sticky protein fragment, or peptide, that accumulates in the brain, disrupting communication between brain cells called neurons.",0
78,"Much of this damage occurs, Ming said, when beta-amyloid attaches itself to metals such as iron or copper.",0
78,"These metals can cause beta-amyloid peptides to misfold and bind together in clumps that can promote inflammation and oxidation - a process similar to rusting - in nearby neurons, eventually killing them.",0
78,Previous research conducted by other scientists suggests that beetroot juice can improve oxygen flow to the ageing brain and possibly improve cognitive performance.,1
78,"Ming and colleagues wanted to find out if betanin, a beet compound used in commercial dyes that readily binds to metals, could block the effects of copper on beta-amyloid and, in turn, prevent the misfolding of these peptides and the oxidation of neurons.",0
78,"They conducted a series of experiments involving 3,5 di-tert-butylcatechol, or DTBC.",0

98,Liu and his fellow researchers conducted five nights of sleep studies in 34 healthy men with an average age of 33.,1

98,"The doses of testosterone and hydrocortisone were in the midrange of levels that the body normally produces, according to Liu.",0
98,"This arm of the study was called a dual ""clamp"" because it stopped the body's production of these two hormones and then gave them a fixed amount of the hormones, thus clamping levels in a normal hormonal balance, he said.",0

100,"""This idea must be tested in humans to know whether it applies to our species.""",0
100,"Wang noted that all over the world, puberty is starting earlier than it did in the past.",0
100,"""Childhood obesity, a common health issue, is one of the risk factors for early puberty,"" she said.",0
100,"""Previous evidence from animals has revealed that post-weaning overeating advances the timing of puberty, but we lack knowledge of how nutrition before weaning influences metabolism and reproduction.""",0
100,"To determine how excess body weight alters the timing of puberty, Wang gave mice a high-fat-diet from the date they gave birth and started breastfeeding until they weaned their pups.",0
100,A second group of new mother mice was given a regular diet for the same amount of time.,0
100,Wang found that overfeeding the mothers during breastfeeding can cause obesity in the pups and significantly advance the start of their puberty.,1
100,"""These results show that the breast-feeding phase is a critical window that influences when puberty happens,"" Wang said.",0
100,"Fertility tests of the mice in adulthood showed that those whose mothers had been fed a high-fat diet while breastfeeding had decreased litter size, longer duration from mating to date of birth and impaired pregnancy rate in both female and male mice.",0
100,The researchers also found these mice suffered from glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity--signs of an increased risk of developing diabetes during adulthood.,0
100,"""Our results reinforce the findings of previous studies that childhood obesity causes advanced puberty and metabolic disorders in adulthood,"" Wang said.",0
100,"""Correct treatment and follow-up are both important for patients with early puberty.",1

101,"WASHINGTON DC: There's a link between insufficient sleep and the development of insulin resistance, one of the factors that cause type 2 diabetes, and now, a team of researchers has discovered a biological reason for this relationship, at least in men: an imbalance between their testosterone and cortisol hormones.",0
101,"""Our highly controlled sleep study showed that even one night of restricted sleep can cause insulin resistance and that we can dampen this effect by controlling levels of these two important hormones,"" said senior investigator Peter Y. Liu of Los Angeles Biomedical (LA BioMed) Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, Calif.

Insulin resistance occurs when the body does not properly use the hormone insulin.",0
101,"Testosterone is the main anabolic, or muscle-building, hormone, whereas cortisol--often called the ""stress hormone""--helps catabolism, or breaking down energy and fat stores for use, Liu explained.",0
101,Past research shows that sleep loss reduces a man's testosterone levels and increases cortisol levels.,1
101,Liu and his fellow researchers conducted five nights of sleep studies in 34 healthy men with an average age of 33.,1
101,"They controlled what the subjects ate and how much they slept, giving them 10 hours of sleep the first night and restricting them to four hours of sleep the remaining nights.",0
101,"In this ""crossover"" study, the men served as their own controls.",0
101,"In one series of sleep studies, they received three medications: ketoconazole, which switches off the body's production of testosterone and cortisol; testosterone gel; and oral hydrocortisone, a synthetic form of cortisol.",0
101,"The doses of testosterone and hydrocortisone were in the midrange of levels that the body normally produces, according to Liu.",0
101,"This arm of the study was called a dual ""clamp"" because it stopped the body's production of these two hormones and then gave them a fixed amount of the hormones, thus clamping levels in a normal hormonal balance, he said.",0
101,"In another set of experiments, the men received inactive placebos that matched the medications.",0
101,"The order of when they received the clamp and the placebo was random, with a two-week interval between the study conditions.",0
101,"The morning after the first and last nights of each part of the study, all men took the oral glucose tolerance test, in which they gave blood samples while fasting and again after drinking a sugary drink.",0
101,"This test result allowed the researchers to calculate each man's insulin resistance using standard measures, including the Matsuda Index.",1
101,"After sleep restriction, this index reportedly showed greater insulin resistance with both the clamp and the placebo.",1
101,"However, Liu said this increase was significantly dampened, or less severe, with the dual-clamp, demonstrating that testosterone and cortisol reduced the negative effects of sustained sleep restriction on insulin resistance.",0
101,"""Maintaining hormonal balance could prevent metabolic ill health occurring in individuals who do not get enough sleep,"" he said.",0
101,"""Understanding these hormonal mechanisms could lead to new treatments or strategies to prevent insulin resistance due to insufficient sleep.""",1

102,"LONDON: If you thought it might be possible to be overweight or obese but not at increased risk of heart disease, think again!",1
102,"A new study of nearly 300,000 people has found that unhealthy weight gain can raise risk of heart attacks, strokes and high blood pressure.",1
102,"The risk of heart and blood vessel problems increases as body mass index (BMI) increases beyond 22-23 kg per square metre, said the study published in the European Heart Journal.",1
102,"Furthermore, the findings showed that the risk also increases steadily the more fat a person carries around their waist.",0
102,"""By maintaining a healthy BMI of around 22-23 kg per square metre, healthy people can minimise their risk of developing or dying from heart disease,"" said lead researcher Stamatina Iliodromiti from University of Glasgow in Britain.",1
102,"Although it is already known that being overweight or obese increases a person's risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as other diseases such as cancer, there have also been studies that have suggested otherwise.",0
102,"These studies have cliamed that, particularly in the elderly, being overweight or even obese might not have any effect on deaths from CVD or other causes, and may even be protective, especially if people maintain a reasonable level of fitness.",0
102,"This is known as the ""obesity paradox"".",0
102,"However, the new study refute these previous, conflicting findings.",0
102,"""Any public misconception of a potential 'protective' effect of fat on heart and stroke risks should be challenged,"" Iliodromiti said.",0
102,"The researchers found that as BMI increased above 22 kg per square metre, the risk of CVD increased by 13 per cent for every 5.2 kg per square metre increase in women and 4.3 kg per square metre in men.",1
102,"""This is the largest study that provides evidence against the obesity paradox in healthy people,"" Iliodromiti said.",0
102,"""It is possible that the story may be different for those with pre-existing disease because there is evidence that in cancer patients, for instance, being slightly overweight is associated with lower risk, especially as cancer and its treatments can lead to unhealthy weight loss,"" she added.",0

103,"At a time when self-worth is measured in the number of likes one gets for pictures and the number of friends and followers one has online, a lot boils down to that ‘perfect’ picture.",0
103,"With this comes an almost unrealistic expectation or aspiration of how one should look, which is fuelling the prevalence of eating disorders which is dismissed by many.",1
103,"While the prevalence of eating disorders in India is lower than that of western countries it appears to be increasing, according to experts.",1
103,"An eating disorder is defined as a persistent disturbance of eating behaviour or behaviour intended to control weight, which significantly impairs physical health or psychosocial functioning, often turning out to be a chronic psychiatric condition.",0
103,"They tend to be emotional disorders that focus on food, but are actually attempts to deal with perfectionism and a desire to gain control by strictly regulating food and weight, experts said.",0
103,"The common types of eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder.Treatment for these kinds of disorders has to be a multi-pronged approach, experts said.",0
103,"“Dietary treatment alone will not help without counselling as it is a psychological problem,” said Raj.",0
103,"“When someone has anorexia nervosa, there are a number of other issues that they face like dental issues, acidity, chronic sore throat and so on.",0
103,"In order to treat such a patient, it is imperative to have a good general physician who can help with sorting out the medical issues, a trained psychologist or counsellor who can help in bringing in a positive outlook on body image and a dietician who can educate the patient on the importance of a balanced diet.”

Psychological counsellor Sneha Hindocha concurred with Raj’s view.",0
103,"She stressed the importance of a holistic approach to the treatment process and said acceptance of the issue is the first step towards treatment.“When it comes to body image issues, the only way a patient can get better is if they accept and believe that they are okay with the way their bodies are,” said Hindocha.",0
103,"“Counselling is a powerful tool that can help such patients but when it comes to severe cases, medication is a must, especially in severe anorexia cases where the patient has lost a lot of weight as it can be life-threatening.",0
103,The support of family and friends is essential in these cases as they play a bigger role than the counsellor.,0
103,"Sensitising them to the needs of the patients is crucial.”

Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterised by excessive restriction on food intake and irrational fear of gaining weight, often accompanied by a distorted body self-perception, explained a report published in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine in April, 2015.",0
103,"It is clinically diagnosed more frequently in females, with type and severity varying with each case.",0
103,"While the cases of anorexia nervosa are reported greatly in the grey literatures of the western countries, the number of clinical cases in India is on the rise, the report said.",0
103,The age of onset for most cases ranges between 12 to 20 years and most cases are brought to clinical attention only when there are severe somatic complaints.,0
103,"In developing countries like India, severe anorexia is not commonly reported.",0
103,"“The body gets its energy from carbohydrates, proteins and fats,” said dietician Dr Preethi Raj.",0
103,"“In the case of anorexia, the patient generally restricts carbohydrates which is very harmful as in the case of adolescents and young adults, carbohydrates should constitute 45-65% of the total calories.",0
103,Not having a proper intake can lead to adverse issues like malnutrition and muscle loss.,0
103,"Further, it has protein sparing action.",0
103,Most of them take fruits and vegetables only and it doesn’t give enough protein and fat.,0
103,"Protein is important for immunity fighting against infection while fat makes hormones.”

Experts have emphasised greatly the role that social media played in sparking a negative body image.",0
103,"They said that, in turn, lays the foundation for eating disorders to gain a stronghold in the minds of impressionable youngsters.“Social media is the forum where the perception of the self and worthiness of the self is measured today,” said Mumbai-based cyber psychologist Nirali Bhatia.",0
103,"“Being picture perfect and the need to be accepted, appreciated and acknowledged by others weighs down heavily on a number of people.",0
103,"There’s also a huge information overload that has come in with the internet, which provides young children with access to unverified information too early that has the potential to colour their perception.”

Raj said that parents and friends should look out for a few tell-tale signs.",0
103,"These include malnutrition, sunken eyes, bloated belly, constipation or diarrhoea, erratic menstrual cycle, insomnia or disturbed sleep, waking up in the wee hours of the morning and frequent changes in weight.",0
103,"“Eating disorders tend to stem from low self-esteem and peer pressure,” said Bhatia.",1
103,“I have noticed that a number of young children are facing issues of binge eating where it forms a cycle of overeating and starvation.,0
103,Most of these children are either bullied in person or online and find some comfort in food.,0
103,"They tend to get a rush the moment they eat, which relieves their stress and right after that they feel a sense of guilt and starve themselves.”

Experts believe that awareness is the key to overcoming these disorders.",0
103,They said that most people take these issues lightly as they themselves do not know how these disorders can wreck havoc on their bodies.,0

110,"According to a study led by the Imperial College London, girls who start puberty earlier are more likely to be overweight as adults.",1
110,The researchers say their findings strengthen existing evidence of a link between the onset of puberty and a woman's body mass in adulthood.,0
110,"Previous studies have established a link between obesity and puberty, with increased bodyweight known to be a risk factor for girls starting puberty earlier.",1
110,"But now this latest research shows that early puberty is itself a risk factor for being overweight, with girls who have their first period earlier more likely to have a higher Body Mass Index (BMI).",0
110,"According to the authors of the study, their findings help to untangle these complex external factors and add insight into an underlying causal link, showing that early puberty has a significant impact on a woman's risk of obesity.",0
110,"Dr Dipender Gill, the first author of the study, said: ""Previous studies have shown there is an association, but we didn't know whether early puberty caused obesity in adulthood, or was simply associated with it.",0
110,"In our latest study, we've generated evidence to support that it is a causal effect.""",0
110,"In order to get around the effects of confounding factors, the research team used genetic variants as a tool to look at the effect of the onset of puberty (known as age at menarche), measured as the age of a girl's first period.",0
110,"In the latest study, researchers employed a statistical technique called Mendelian Randomization which uses these genetic variants as a tool to show the causal relationship between earlier puberty and increased BMI.",0
110,"Using data from 182,416 women they identified 122 genetic variants that were strongly associated with the onset of puberty - with the women's age at first period obtained via questionnaire.",0
110,"Initial analysis revealed a link between these genetic variants and BMI, with those women who had variants associated with earlier puberty having an increased BMI.",1
110,"The researchers then tested for this same association in a third group 70,962 women, finding the same association.",0
110,"Dr Gill, added, ""Some of these genetic variants are associated with earlier puberty and some with later onset, so by taking advantage of this we were able to investigate any association of age at menarche with BMI in adulthood”.",0
110,"""We're not saying that it's a genetic effect, but rather that by using these genetic variants as a proxy for earlier puberty, we are able to show the effect of earlier puberty without the impact of external factors that might confound our analysis.",1
110,"We performed a range of statistical sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings and they remained strong through this, so within the limitations of the study design, we are confident of findings.""",0
110,"According to the researchers, it remains unclear how maturing earlier has a direct impact on body weight, but they indicate that differences between physical and emotional maturity may play a role.",0
110,It could be that young women who mature earlier than their peers are treated differently or have different societal pressures than girls of the same age who have not started puberty.,0
110,"Another explanation could be the physical effects of hormonal changes during puberty, such as increased fat deposition in breast tissue, which when established earlier may move them to a higher risk profile for higher BMI or obesity in later life.",0
110,"""It is difficult to say that changing someone's age of puberty will affect their adult risk of obesity and whether it is something that we can clinically apply - as it would unlikely be ethically appropriate to accelerate or delay the rate of puberty to affect BMI,"" added Dr Gill.",0
110,"""But it is useful for us to be aware that it's a causal factor- girls who reach puberty earlier may be more likely to be overweight when they are older.""",0

111,Researchers at the University of Glasgow led by Dr Stamatina Iliodromiti found that people with a BMI between 22-23 kg/m2 had the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).,0
111,"Compared to women and men with waist circumferences of 74 and 83 cm respectively, the CVD risk increased by16 percent in women and 10 percent in men for every 12.6 cm and 11.4 cm increase in waist circumference for women and men respectively.",0
111,"Similar increases in CVD risk were seen when the researchers looked at waist-to-hip and waist-to-height ratios and percentage body fat mass - all of which are considered reliable ways to accurately gauge the amount of fat a person carries, also known as adiposity.",0
111,"Although it is already known that being overweight or obese increases a person's risk of CVD, as well as other diseases such as cancer, there have also been studies that have suggested that, particularly in the elderly, being overweight or even obese might not have any effect on deaths from CVD or other causes, and may even be protective, especially if people maintain a reasonable level of fitness.",0
111,"This is known as the ""obesity paradox"".",0
111,"However, the authors of the study said their results refute these previous conflicting findings.",0
111,"""Any public misconception of a potential 'protective' effect of fat on heart and stroke risks should be challenged,"" said Dr Iliodromiti.",0
111,"She continued, ""This is the largest study that provides evidence against the obesity paradox in healthy people.",1
111,"It is possible that the story may be different for those with the pre-existing disease because there is evidence that in cancer patients, for instance, being slightly overweight is associated with lower risk, especially as cancer and its treatments can lead to unhealthy weight loss.",0
111,"""By maintaining a healthy BMI of around 22-23 kg/m2, healthy people can minimise their risk of developing or dying from heart disease.",1
111,"In terms of other adiposity measures, the less fat, especially around their abdomen, they have, the lower the risk of future heart disease.""",1
111,"However, the researchers recognise that it can be difficult for some people to maintain a BMI of 22-23 kg/m2, particularly as they get older.",0
111,"Co-author, Naveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine at the University of Glasgow, said, ""We know many cannot get to such low BMIs so the message is, whatever your BMI, especially when in the overweight or obese range, losing a few kilograms or more if possible, will only improve your health.",0
111,"There are no downsides to losing weight intentionally and the health professions need to get better at helping people lose weight.""",0
111,The researchers say their findings may have implications for guidelines on preventing and managing cardiovascular disease.,0
111,"The researchers suggest that the previous confusion over the ""obesity paradox"" may be due to many factors that can confound results of studies.",1
111,"For instance, smoking changes the distribution of fat in the body, smokers may have lower weight as smoking depresses appetites and so BMI tends to be lower.",0

131,"According to a study, a lifetime of regular exercise can delay aging.",1
131,The researchers at the University of Birmingham and King's College London set out to assess the health of older adults who had exercised most of their adult lives to see if this could slow down aging.,0
131,"The study recruited 125 amateur cyclists aged 55 to 79, 84 of which were male and 41 were female.",1
131,"The men had to be able to cycle 100 km in under 6.5 hours, while the women had to be able to cycle 60 km in 5.5 hours.",0
131,"Smokers, heavy drinkers and those with high blood pressure or other health conditions were excluded from the study.",0
131,The participants underwent a series of tests in the laboratory and were compared to a group of adults who do not partake in regular physical activity.,0
131,This group consisted of 75 healthy people aged 57 to 80 and 55 healthy young adults aged 20 to 36.,1
131,The study showed that loss of muscle mass and strength did not occur in those who exercise regularly.,1
131,"The cyclists also did not increase their body fat or cholesterol levels with age and the men's testosterone levels also remained high, suggesting that they may have avoided most of the male menopause.",0
131,"More surprisingly, the study also revealed that the benefits of exercise extend beyond muscle as the cyclists also had an immune system that did not seem to have aged either.",0
131,"An organ called the thymus, which makes immune cells called T cells, starts to shrink from the age of 20 and makes less T cells.",0
131,"In this study, however, the cyclists' thymuses were making as many T cells as those of a young person.",0
131,The findings come as figures show that less than half of over 65s do enough exercise to stay healthy and more than half of those aged over 65 suffer from at least two diseases.,0
131,"Professor Janet Lord, Director of the Institute of Inflammation and Ageing at the University of Birmingham, said: ""Hippocrates in 400 BC said that exercise is man's best medicine, but his message has been lost over time and we are an increasingly sedentary society.",0
131,"""However, importantly, our findings debunk the assumption that ageing automatically makes us more frail.",0
131,"""Our research means we now have strong evidence that encouraging people to commit to regular exercise throughout their lives is a viable solution to the problem that we are living longer but not healthier.""",1
131,"Dr Niharika Arora Duggal, also of the University of Birmingham, said: ""We hope these findings prevent the danger that, as a society, we accept that old age and disease are normal bedfellows and that the third age of man is something to be endured and not enjoyed.""",0
131,"Professor Stephen Harridge, Director of the Centre of Human & Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King's College London, said: ""The findings emphasise the fact that the cyclists do not exercise because they are healthy, but that they are healthy because they have been exercising for such a large proportion of their lives.",0
131,"""Their bodies have been allowed to age optimally, free from the problems usually caused by inactivity.",0
131,"Remove the activity and their health would likely deteriorate.""",0
131,"Norman Lazarus, Emeritus Professor at King's College London and also a master cyclist and Dr Ross Pollock, who undertook the muscle study, both agreed that: ""Most of us who exercise have nowhere near the physiological capacities of elite athletes.",0
131,"""We exercise mainly to enjoy ourselves.",0
131,Nearly everybody can partake in an exercise that is in keeping with their own physiological capabilities.,0

132,"In contrast to women, sexual regret for men was not found to be affected by whether they took the initiative.",1
132,"""Women who initiate sex are likely to have at least two distinguishing qualities,"" said Professor David Buss from the University of Texas at Austin in the US.",0
132,"""First, they are likely to have a healthy sexual psychology, being maximally comfortable with their own sexuality.",0
132,"Second, women who initiate have maximum choice of precisely who they want to have sex with.",0
132,"Consequently, they have less reason to feel regret, since they've made their own choice,"" Buss added.",1
132,"While initiative is the clearest gender-differentiating factor for regret after casual sex, other conditions can also affect how much an individual regrets the encounter.",0

132,"But these effects are not as strong in men, Bendixen said.",0
132,"""Women have less regret if the sex was good.",0
132,"For men, this also plays a less important role.",0
132,"The underlying causes are biological,"" Bendixen said.",0
132,Women also feel disgust more often than men after a short-term sexual encounter.,0
132,"This is a key factor in whether or not they feel regret, the study said.",0
132,"""The feeling of disgust or revulsion is the single factor that best explained why women and men regretted the last time they had casual sex when we controlled for all other factors,"" Bendixen said.",0
132,"People may feel disgust because they feel moral regret, but also if the act is unhygienic or if the sex itself was perceived as gross.",0

148,And most workshops also have a pseudo-attacker to practice live.,0
148,"“These live demonstrations are the most interesting part of the workshop because we could practice the key defensive movements that were taught,” says Dhanupriya, saying she still practices these punches during her running fitness routines every morning.",0
148,"Though many women opt for longer training courses after these short workshops, specialising in one form of martial arts, there are many who don’t have the time and ability to do so.",0

149,"Swati Kapoor, Co-Founder of SoulTree, Blossom Kochhar, Chairperson, Blossom Kochhar Group of Companies, and Pallavi Mehra, Marketing Manager at VanityCask, have shared tips:

* Face cleansers: Regular skin cleansing at night is critical to maintaining a healthy skin.",0
149,A clean and dirt-free face helps keep pores open and aids the skin to breathe better.,1
149,"Restore the skin's natural balance by using cleansers made with Ayurvedic ingredients such as aloe vera, turmeric, honey that leave the skin clean, hydrated and nourished.",0
149,* Moisturise: Moisturising should be an essential step in your night skincare regime.,0
149,"It helps in repairing your skin, keeping it soft and prevents it from sagging.",0
149,"Apply a cream that has natural and nourishing ingredients like kokum butter and honey, especially for hands and feet before going to sleep at night.",0
149,* Under eye gel: The area under the eyes is the first to show signs of ageing.,0
149,"Apply an under-eye gel every night before going to bed to reduce puffiness, wrinkles and dark circles under the eyes.",0
149,* Lip balms: An effective lip balm keeps moisture in and protects lips from dryness and cracking.,0
149,"Pick a lip balm that is made with natural ingredients such as ghee and almond oil, that will help heal, condition and keep your lips soft and supple.",0
149,* Dark circles make your skin tone look uneven.,0
149,"Avacado and almonds are not only good for your health but for your eyes too, apply their oils and wake up with puffy-less eyes and reduced dark circle; with regular application, say bye-bye to them.",0
149,* Sleep on silk pillow: A silk night suit is an excellent choice but a silk pillowcase will be even better.,1
149,"Silk is easier on your face and your hair, as it reduces split ends and gives you a crease-free face in the morning.",0
149,* Let your skin breathe in and breathe out: One mistake most people make is sleeping with their make-up on.,1
149,Not only is it unhealthy for your skin but there is a big chance that it might lead to breakouts and skin dehydration.,1
149,It is extremely essential to remove your make-up before sleeping for a rejuvenated skin.,0
149,"* CTM process: After you are done with cleansing and toning, use a light moisturiser for nourishment, then use nourishing serum and a night cream post that.",0
149,"For night, you need products with more nourishing ingredient and no SPF involved.",0
149,* Pamper your hands and feet: Beauty is not only about your face.,0
149,It is achieved when the entire body feels great.,0
149,Give your hands and feet the care they deserve by moisturising them before hitting the bed.,0

150,"In fact, more serotonin (happy hormone) is produced in the gut than anywhere else in the body.",0
150,The gut can actually communicate with the brain and therefore gut bacteria are crucial in determining your mood and anxiety.,1
150,Nurturing our gut bacteria so that they are more beneficial than harmful is one of the most important choices that we can make for our health.,1
150,"Thus, consuming probiotics or beneficial bacteria that restore better digestive health and help the immune function in a more balanced manner is essential.",0

151,As far as I know there has not been a single instance where metallic preparations of reputed Ayurvedic drug manufacturers prescribed by qualified and experienced vaidyars have caused either nephrotoxicity or hepato-toxicity.,0
151,"In Ayurveda, since digestion is considered a key to good health, things that compromise the functioning of organs involved in the processing of foods or elimination of wastes would never be prescribed.",0

151,"They may be misused by the quacks, but the drugs themselves are not neurotoxic, hepato-toxic or nephrotoxic.",0
151,The reasons Ayurvedic metallic preparations are not toxic is because the metals are first subjected to purificatory measures.,1
151,Vaidyars use natural acidic and alkaline substances to purify the metals and then subject them to varying degrees of heat to convert them into a bhasma or nanoparticles.,0
151,They look like magic potions.,0

154,NEW YORK: Researchers at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have discovered a new target for treating major depressive disorder.,1
154,The research shows that individuals with high levels of an enigmatic receptor called GPR158 may be more susceptible to depression following chronic stress.,1
154,"""The next step in this process is to come up with a drug that can target this receptor,"" said senior author of the study Kirill Martemyanov, from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) in the US.",0
154,The researchers zeroed in on GPR158 as a player in depression after discovering that the protein is elevated in people with major depressive disorder.,1
154,"To better understand GPR158's role, the scientists studied male and female mice with and without GPR158 receptors.",0
154,Behavioural tests revealed that both male and female mice with elevated GPR158 show signs of depression following chronic stress.,1
154,"On the flip side, suppression of GPR158 protects mice from developing depressive-like behaviours and make them resilient to stress.",0
154,"For the study, published in the journal eLife, the researchers also examined why GPR158 has these effects on depression.",1
154,"The team demonstrated that GPR158 affects key signaling pathways involved in mood regulation in the region of the brain called prefrontal cortex, though the researchers emphasised that the exact mechanisms remain to be established.",0
154,"The researchers explained that GPR158 is a so-called ""orphan receptor"" -- which gets its name because its binding partner/partners are unknown -- with a poorly understood biology and mechanism of action.",0
154,"GPR158 appears to work downstream from other important brain systems, such as the GABA, a major player in the brain's inhibitory control and adrenergic system involved in stress effects.",0
155,"LOS ANGELES: Elderly people with a certain type of hearing loss may be more likely to also have memory loss and thinking problems called mild cognitive impairment, says a study.",1
155,"The study, presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 70th Annual Meeting in Los Angeles, looked at people with peripheral age-related hearing loss, which is caused by problems in how the inner ear and hearing nerves function and leads to people not being able to hear.",0
155,"It also looked at central age-related hearing loss, which is caused by problems in the brain's ability to process sound and leads people to say, ""I can hear, but I can't understand.""",0
155,The researchers found that people with central hearing loss were twice as likely to have mild cognitive impairment as people who had no hearing loss.,1
155,"""These preliminary results suggest that central hearing loss may share the same progressive loss of functioning in brain cells that occurs in cognitive decline, rather than the sensory deprivation that happens with peripheral hearing loss,"" said study author Rodolfo Sardone from the University of Bari in Italy.",0
155,"""It's a problem with perception.",0
155,"Tests of hearing perception should be given to people who are older than 65 and also to people with cognitive impairment,"" Sardone added.",0
155,"Hearing loss is one of the most common disabilities in elderly people, affecting about one-third of people over age 65.",0

159,"According to a Drexel University- study, screening for food insecurity at the paediatrician's office can be quite effective, but fear of Child Protective Services and a complicated referral process could be barriers to food insecure families getting the help they need.",0
159,"A two-question food insecurity screening was added to the visits of more than 7,000 families at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) over a two-year period to find out how useful it was.",1
159,The evaluation of the effort - run by the Center for Hunger-Free Communities of Drexel University's Dornsife School of Public Health in collaboration with CHOP and Benefits Data Trust - sought to determine what barriers there might be to implementing such screening and how it could be made most successful.,0
159,"""The screening itself worked very well: Providers could incorporate it into their workflow, and many parents and caregivers responded,"" said Molly Knowles, who served as the lead author of the study.",0
159,"More than 1,000 families - roughly 15 percent - of the families involved reported food insecurity (meaning that they did not have enough money for consistent access to food).",1
159,"Of that group, more than half were referred to Benefits Data Trust for further services and resources.",1
159,But the challenge came after these initial interactions.,0
159,It was then that connections were dropped.,0
159,"""Because of patient privacy and confidentiality protections, there were several steps in between being able to identify a food insecure family and connecting them with resources,"" Knowles explained.",1
159,"""That meant that parents - more than 60 percent - weren't able to connect with the referral agency.""",0
159,Red tape wasn't the only major barrier discovered by the study.,0
159,"Parents were also initially reluctant to say that they were struggling to feed their families, for fear that they'd be reported as unfit caregivers.",0
159,"""Parents know that healthcare providers are mandatory reporters of child abuse and neglect, and although food insecurity is not a form of neglect, many parents described feelings of shame and fear of Child Protective Services involvement,"" Knowles explained.",0
159,The study showed that medical professionals were eager to implement the hunger screening and parents reported interest in being asked about food needs: everything just came down to better communication.,0
159,"With that, any unfounded fears from parents might be alleviated, and other obstacles could be solved by health providers from the outset.",0
159,"Something that the researchers didn't expect to find was that of those who reported being food insecure and referred for help, 79 percent already participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps).",0
159,"""Parents recommended connecting families with immediate resources - not only food resources, but other resources that could free up household budgets for food - to supplement any public benefits they may already receive,"" Knowles said.",0
159,"So that fewer families are lost between their screening and being referred to an assisting agency, Knowles recommended getting families' consent to share contact info right away at the first screening.",0
159,"Although this study only took place at CHOP in Philadelphia, its results fall in line with others.",0
159,The interest is certainly there for the screening.,0

168,"Mellissa Prunty, who runs a research clinic at Brunel University London investigating key skills in childhood, including handwriting, said that increasing numbers of children may be developing handwriting late because of an overuse of technology.",0
168,"""One problem is that handwriting is very individual in how it develops in each child,"" said Prunty.",1
168,"""Without research, the risk is that we make too many assumptions about why a child isn't able to write at the expected age and don't intervene when there is a technology-related cause,"" she said.",0
168,"Although the early years' curriculum has handwriting targets for every year, different primary schools focus on handwriting in different ways - with some using tablets alongside pencils, Prunty said.",1

169,"SEOUL: Scientists have developed a smart contact lens that can monitor blood sugar levels from tears in the eye in patients with diabetes, spelling an end for painful needle pricks.",1
169,"For diabetics, monitoring and controlling blood sugar levels are extremely important because having high blood glucose levels for extended periods of time can lead to a host of diabetes complications.",1
169,An enzyme-based finger-pricking method is the most commonly used technology in diabetic assessment.,0
169,"However, such approach has been said to reduce compliance among diabetic patients.",0
169,"The smart lens, developed by researchers from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), has built-in pliable, transparent electronics that can monitor glucose levels from tears in the eye.",1
169,"Although the device has not yet been tested in humans, researchers expect it will offer diabetics a pain-free way to measure their glucose levels in the blink of an eye.",0
169,"In the last several decades, many attempts have been made to monitor glucose levels in tears with smart contact lenses, but they are often not used due to poor wearability.",0
169,"To solve contact lens discomfort issues, the team led by Jang-Ung Park of UNIST have unveiled a new smart contact lens that uses electrodes made up of highly stretchable and transparent materials.",1
169,"The clear, flexible lens also contains a glucose sensor that sends electrical signals to an LED.",0
169,"With this sensor, patients can transmit their health information in real-time using the embedded wireless antenna in the lens.",0
169,"In the study, the research team has successfully tested their prototype lens on a live rabbit via non-invasive in-vivo testing.",0
169,The rabbit showed no signs of abnormal behaviour during repeated eye blinks and the LED pixel turned off when tear fluids with glucose concentration were over the threshold.,0
169,"In addition, during the wireless operations, this smart contact lens could still maintain the eye temperature stably without abrupt heating.",1
169,"""These smart contact lenses are made of transparent nanomaterials and therefore do not obstruct the wearer's view,"" said Jihun Park, first author of the study published in the journal Science Advances.",0
169,"""Besides, because the system uses a wireless antenna to read sensor information, no separate power source, like a battery is required for the smart contact lens sensors,"" Park said.",0
169,"""Our smart contact lens provides a platform for wireless, continuous, and noninvasive monitoring of physiological conditions, as well as the detection of biomarkers associated with ocular and other diseases,"" said Park.",0
169,"""It also offers the potential for expanded applicability in other areas, such as smart devices for drug delivery and augmented reality,"" he said.",0
170,"LONDON: The presence of gut flora in the intestines may cause health benefits for some people, whereas it increases the risk of obesity in the others, researchers have claimed.",1
170,"While sourcing a new link between gut bacteria and obesity, the animal based study found that certain amino acids in our blood can be connected to both obesity and the composition of the gut microbiome.",1
170,"Obesity-related metabolites were linked to four different intestinal bacteria namely Blautia, Dorea and Ruminococcus in the Lachnospiraceae family, and SHA98, the researchers noted.",1
170,"The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, mentioned that the gut microbiota affects our metabolism and lead to cardiovascular diseases and Type 2 diabetes.",0
170,"Previous studies have shown that people with these diseases have varying occurrence of different metabolites, that is small molecules or metabolic residues, in the bloodstream.",0
170,The researchers analysed blood plasma and stool samples from 674 participants in the Malmö Offspring Study (MOS).,0
170,They found 19 different metabolites that could be linked to the person's body mass index (BMI); glutamate and so-called BCAA (branched-chain and aromatic amino acids) had the strongest connection to obesity.,0
170,"""The differences in BMI were largely explained by the differences in the levels of glutamate and BCAA.",0
170,"This indicates that the metabolites and gut bacteria interact, rather than being independent of each other,"" said Marju Orho-Melander, Professor at Lund University in Sweden.",1

171,"NEW DELHI: The annual holiday festival of colours, Holi, is less than a week away, and as usual, we can expect the traditional promises to be made of renewed friendship, forgiveness for sins committed in the recent past, and a fun-filled day of frolic marked by a splashing of coloured powder, water and balloons, and a chanting ""Holi Hai"".",0
171,"Traditionally spring flowers, berries, spices and other plants were used for making coloured Gulal and wet colours from flowers like hibiscus etc.",0
171,"There is no doubt that Holi is one of the popular festivals of India, but there are dangers too associated with the event such as the blatant use of expensive, artificial and bright colours made with the help of chemical solvents and toxic agents like the lead oxide,mercury sulphite and copper sulphate etc.",0

But again, all of us love this carnival of colours, and according to Husain, can enjoy the festival with the use of organic and home-made colours.",0
171,These are available in markets but cost more.,0
171,It is essential to take appropriate safety steps to prevent your skin or hair from getting damaged.,0
171,The dry “Gulal” and the wet colours of today are not derived from natural sources.,0
171,"They contain chemicals, shiny particles of mica and even lead, which not only irritate the skin, but collect on the scalp.",0
171,"Since Holi is played outdoors, exposure to the sun can have a detrimental effect on the skin.",0
171,"Apart from harmful UV radiation, sun-exposure makes the skin dry by causing depletion of moisture and also tans the skin.",0
171,The skin can become dry and dull after playing Holi.,0
171,"What, therefore, are the preventives?",0
171,Husain advises one and all to apply sunscreen 20 minutes before going out in the sun.,0
171,“Use a sunscreen of SPF 20 and above.,0
171,"If your skin is prone to pigmented patches, select a higher SPF.",0
171,Most sunscreens have built-in moisturizers.,0

171,Apply transparent nail varnish on the nails.,0
171,This helps to protect nails from absorbing Holi colours.,1
171,"When it comes to removal of colours, rinse the face with plenty of plain water and then use a cleansing cream or lotion.",1
171,Then wipe off with moist cotton wool.,0
171,"Remember to cleanse the area around the eyes too, using a light touch.",0
171,A cleansing gel helps to dissolve the colours and facilitates their removal.,0
171,"“To make your own cleanser, take half a cup of cold milk and add one teaspoon of any vegetable oil, like “til,” olive or sunflower oil.",0

171,"Sesame seed (til) oil actually helps to counteract sun-damage,” the beauty expert said.",0
171,"While bathing, scrub the body gently with a loofah or wash cloth.",0
171,"Immediately after your bath, apply a moisturizer on the face and body, while the skin is still damp.",0
171,This helps to seal in moisture.,0
171,"If there is itching, add two tablespoons vinegar to a mug of water and use it as a last rinse.",0
171,This helps to reduce itching.,0
171,"However, if the itching continues, and there is rash and redness, there may be an allergic reaction to the colour.",0
171,Consult a doctor as soon as possible.,0
171,"While washing the hair, first rinse with plenty of plain water to wash away the dry colours and tiny particles of mica.",1

172,WASHINGTON: Scientists have identified a drug that extends egg viability in worms and could theoretically extend women's fertility by three to six years.,1
172,"""As early as the mid-30s, women start to experience declines in fertility, increased rates of miscarriage and maternal age-related birth defects,"" said Coleen Murphy from the Princeton University in the US.",0
172,"""All of these problems are thought to be caused by declining egg quality, rather than a lack of eggs,"" said Murphy.",1
172,"The researchers used a microscopic worm, Caenorhabditis elegans (C elegans), to study longevity.",1
172,"For the study, published in the journal Current Biology, they investigated downregulated group of proteins, cathepsin B proteases, that are rare in high-quality eggs and more common in eggs that have begun degrading with age.",0
172,The existence of drugs that block these exact proteins provided an opportunity to test their effects.,0
172,Another experiment that knocked out the cathepsin B genes entirely succeeded in extending worms fertility by about 10 percent.,1
172,"""If applied to humans, it could be a three- to six-year extension of your reproductive period,"" said Nicole Templeman from Princeton University.",0

173,"On October 9 last year—Mata Amritanandamayi's birthday—several stalls were put up at Amritapuri in Kollam, Kerala.",0
173,One of them manned by 19-year-old Swadha Dwivedi was selling reusable sanitary pads.,0
173,"Soon, a middle-aged man came up and said, “How did you come up with this idea?”

Swadha felt embarrassed and said, “This stall is only for women.”

The man said, “You are being discriminatory.",0
173,"You can tell men, too.” Later, when Swadha told Mata Amritanandamayi about this, the latter said, “There is no problem in talking about pads with a man.",0
173,You shouldn’t feel shy.,0
173,"You must help end the stigma around menstruation.”



The reusable pads are available in select stores in South India and online at www.saukhyampads.org and www.amritastore.com

The pad in question is called Saukhyam—a Sanskrit word that means happiness and well-being.",0
173,"Keeping the factors like cost and environment in mind, Amrita Self-Reliant Village (SeRVe) came up with pads made of banana fibre.",1
173,“It is a naturally occurring absorbent with medicinal properties.,0
173,Nobody has used banana fibres to make reusable pads.,1
173,"Amma wanted us to do this,” says Anju Bist, co-director, Amrita SeRVe.",0
173,"Apart from providing a means of personal hygiene to women, these pads have become a source of income for rural women, who manufacture them under the guidance of Mata Amritanandmayi.",0
173,"First, the stalk is cut.",0
173,"Then it is put into an extractor machine, where it is converted into thin strips.",0
173,“These have to be washed in baking soda to make them softer.,0
173,"Then, they are dried in the sun for five days before being given to the village women who convert them into pads,” says Anju.",0
173,The advantage of these pads is that they can be washed and reused.,0
173,"“Also, since they are highly absorbent, a working woman does not have to change a pad for at least eight hours.",1
173,"Moreover, there is an urgent need for such pads because disposable sanitary ones have been causing damage to the environment,” says Anju.",0
173,"Here are the statistics: During her menstrual cycle over a lifetime, a woman will discard anywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 pads.",0
173,"“There are 360 million women, who are of menstruating age, in India,” says Swadha.",0
173,"“If, on an average, they use 12 to15 pads per menstrual cycle it will add up to 432 million soiled pads that weigh 900 tonne and are enough to fill 320 football fields.”

Another attractive quality of Saukhyam is that it is available in different colours.",0
173,"“We want people to buy their pads as if they are buying clothes,” says Deepa H, a staff member of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.",0
173,The prices range between Rs 200 and Rs 2000 depending on whether you are buying individual day/night pads or in packs.,0

180,"LONDON: Sipping wine may be good for your oral health, say scientists who found that certain compounds in the drink can fend of harmful bacteria in the teeth and gums.",1
180,"Traditionally, some health benefits of polyphenols have been attributed to the fact that these compounds are antioxidants, meaning they likely protect the body from harm caused by free radicals.",0
180,"However, recent work indicates polyphenols might also promote health by actively interacting with bacteria in the gut.",1
180,Plants and fruits produce polyphenols to ward off infection by harmful bacteria and other pathogens.,0
180,"Researchers including M Victoria Moreno-Arribas from Institute of Food Science Research (CIAL) in Spain wanted to know whether wine and grape polyphenols would also protect teeth and gums, and how this could work on a molecular level.",0
180,"The study, published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, checked out the effect of two red wine polyphenols, as well as commercially available grape seed and red wine extracts, on bacteria that stick to teeth and gums and cause dental plaque, cavities and periodontal disease.",1
180,"Working with cells that model gum tissue, they found that the two wine polyphenols in isolation - caffeic and p-coumaric acids - were generally better than the total wine extracts at cutting back on the bacteria's ability to stick to the cells.",1
180,"When combined with the Streptococcus dentisani, which is believed to be an oral probiotic, the polyphenols were even better at fending off the pathogenic bacteria.",1
180,The researchers also showed that metabolites formed when digestion of the polyphenols begins in the mouth might be responsible for some of these effects.,0
181,"NEW YORK: The longer a person spends being obese, the higher is the risk of a ""silent"" heart damage, finds a study, which says ""the number of overweight or obese years may ""add up"" to the risk.",1
181,"The findings showed that for each 10 years that a person spends being obese, the risk of having high levels of troponin -- a protein linked with heart damage -- increased 1.25 times, even when accounting for heart disease risk due to high blood pressure, diabetes and kidney disease.",1
181,Troponin is released when the heart muscle has been damaged.,0
181,"The more damage there is to the heart, the greater will be the amount of troponin in the blood.",1
181,"Thus, maintaining a healthy weight across the lifespan is important for keeping the heart healthy and minimising damage as people age, the researchers said.",0
181,"""We're finding that people's weight from age 25 onwards is linked to the risk of more or less heart damage, as measured by levels of the protein troponin, later in life, which underscores the likely importance of long-term weight control for reducing heart disease risk,"" said Chiadi Ndumele, Assistant Professor at the Johns Hopkins University.",0
181,"""The study suggests that even in the absence of such heart disease risk factors as high blood pressure, diabetes or kidney disease, the number of years spent obese or overweight contributes to the higher likelihood of heart damage,"" Ndumele added.",1

Most Android phones will have to wait until 2019 to duplicate the 3D sensing feature behind Apple’s Face ID security, three major parts producers have told Reuters, handicapping Samsung and others on a technology that is set to be worth billions in revenue over the next few years.",0
197,"The development of new features for the estimated 1.5 billion smartphones shipped annually has been at the heart of the battle for global market share over the past decade, with Apple, bolstered by its huge R&D budget, often leading.",0
197,"When the iPhone 5S launched with a fingerprint-sensing home button in September 2013, for example, it took its biggest rival Samsung until just April of the next year to deliver its own in the Galaxy S5, with others following soon after.",0

197,"Tech research house Gartner predicts that by 2021, 40 percent of smartphones will be equipped with 3D cameras, which can also be used for so-called augmented reality, or AR, in which digital objects cling tightly to images of the real world.",0

197,"""I think that is something where you don't want to get left behind.""",0
197,"According to parts manufacturers Viavi Solutions Inc, Finisar Corp and Ams AG, bottlenecks on key parts will mean mass adoption of 3D sensing will not happen until next year, disappointing earlier expectations.",1
197,"That means that China's Huawei, Xiaomi and others could be a total of almost two years behind Apple, which launched Face ID with its iPhone X anniversary phone last September.",0
197,"In particular, Android producers are struggling to source vertical-cavity-surface-emitting lasers, or VCSELs, a core part of Apple's Face ID hardware.",0

209,"City Express got in touch with him on how he got started, and about how being an emotionally strong person has helped him deal with the touching stories he hears on a daily basis.",0
209,"Here’s an excerpt of the conversation we had with him:



How did you get started on The Artidote?",0
209,"In practical terms, The Artidote was launched on Facebook on May 15, 2015.",0
209,It was an evolutionary step from a pilot project I had been working on for over a year (Berlin Artparasites) that acquired quite the traction on social media.,1
209,"In non-practical terms, The Artidote began when I was a ten-year- old Mexican immigrant now living in the US.",0
209,I was bullied in school for being different and not knowing the language or the new social structures.,0
209,"Not having the proper tools to communicate my feelings, expressing myself through art became my only means of connecting with others.",0
209,It was my way to tell stories when I didn’t have a voice.,0
209,"Creating bonds through storytelling, visual and textual, is still one of the foundational pillars of The Artidote.",0
209,Why did you decide to move on from Berlin Art Parasites?,0
209,"After a year of being a community manager for the Berlin-based online magazine, I realised that I had stumbled upon something much bigger than what my job description there entailed.",0
209,"I felt that, in order to make my dreams reach their full potential, I needed to have 100% creative control over the platform and community I had begun to build.",0
209,The Artidote became a natural evolution into something bigger.,0
209,"It offered me the fertile ground where to expand my creative ideas revolving my passions for storytelling, social media, psychology and philanthropy.",1
209,Your tagline is ‘mental health over every damn thing’.,0
209,To what extent do you think art can help people cope with mental illness?,0
209,"From personal experience, I can say that practicing any art form is therapeutic in nature.",0
209,"Whether it is painting, writing, dance, playing music - any art practitioner will tell you how good it feels to be in that creative zone.",0
209,"I have the suspicion that it’s because art allows us to open up a space where to feel what we’re feeling, freely.",0
209,"It sounds simple, but having those spaces where to feel openly all your feelings can be very difficult to find.",0
209,"And only when we are allowed to feel what we’re feeling, can any sort of healing begin to happen.",0
209,You’ve saved lives through social media.,1
209,Do you feel a sense of responsibility towards the millions of people connected to you through The Artidote?,0
209,Always.,0
209,At first I refused to believe that social media (and what I did with it) had the power to save lives.,1
209,But that refusal was mainly due to my fear of the responsibility it brought with it.,0
209,I’m no longer afraid.,0
209,"I want to lead The Artidote with vulnerable honesty, with the hopes that it inspires as many people as possible along the way.",0
209,"There is an unspoken fact that I had to accept a long time ago, however.",0
209,And that is the fact that I will not be able to save every single person that comes in contact with The Artidote on any of its channels.,0
209,It’s an impossibility and responsibility that no person would ever be able to carry.,0
209,"I can only work towards creating a safe, supportive and powerful enough space where to sustain each other and remind ourselves that we are all in this together.",0
209,What was your experience like here in Bengaluru at the Under 25 Summit?,0
209,Did you ever think you’d create something so powerful that has people coming together across continents?,0
209,To be honest—and I don’t think I’ve ever put this on the record—yes.,0
209,"Ever since I was a teenager, I dreamt of creating something of impact that had to do with art.",0
209,I didn’t know what it was back then.,0
209,But life has a way of making things happen when you align yourself in direction of your dreams.,0

NEW YORK: When the world shifted from personal computers to smartphones, websites had to slim down to work on smaller screens and slower wireless connections.",0
221,A similar shift to voice-centric services is again forcing businesses to rethink how they present information to consumers — and spurring new efforts to help them do so.,0

221,"It's not a simple task, since a voice-based digital assistant can't really list dozens of flight options or hundreds of products.",0
221,That means companies have to figure out how to winnow down those choices to the travel options or products people are most likely to want — an inherently fraught undertaking.,1
221,"The technology is still in its infancy, and Adobe doesn't have any actual corporate partners to showcase yet.",0
221,"But its announcement, made in conjunction with a tech show in Barcelona, Spain, shows that voice assistants are becoming important channels for reaching consumers.",0
221,Amazon's voice-shopping feature already boils down shopping requests to one or two options and makes buying easy because it already has payment and shipping information for voice-eligible customers.,0
221,"But smaller businesses don't have the computing resources and expertise to match that, which is where companies like Adobe come in.",1
221,Analyst Carolina Milanesi with Creative Strategies says she's not aware of another service trying to help companies improve how they reach their customers through voice.,1
221,"In practice, making voice capabilities useful means anticipating what customers want.",0
221,"Travel sites, for instance, let people limit a search to, say, nonstop flights, but that's more cumbersome when they're talking to a service.",0
221,"Adobe promises to help narrow those options automatically, so that someone who earns points in United and likes early morning flights might hear only those matches.",0
221,"Adobe's new voice service will work with all major voice assistants, not just Amazon's.",1

222,"Examining this ""novelty hypothesis"", the team found that ""people respond to false news more with surprise and disgust"", whereas true stories produced replies more generally characterised by sadness, anticipation, and trust.",0

223,An online survey finding by Flipkart in partnership with Markelytics Solutions India Pvt.,0
223,Ltd shows that Hyderabad dads love spending time with their family.,0
223,Hyderabad dads also like to engage their kids in common activities like walking and movies.,0
223,“Penguin Dads” - The typical Indian family is full of stereotypes.,0
223,"From the time a child wakes up in the morning, the mother is involved in almost all activities such as getting kids ready for school, feeding them, cooking, cleaning, sitting with kids for evening studies, and eventually putting the child to sleep.",0

223,They represent the progressive change in the fatherhood narrative in India.,0
223,What do “Penguin Dads” do?,0
223,"An increasing number of dads today are engaged in raising their kids, as they are in sharing household chores.",0
223,"They change nappies, braid hair, take kids to school, and put them to bed – many doing it without any help from Moms.",0
223,Why “Penguin” Dads?,1
223,There aren’t many examples of a more dedicated father on earth than the male penguin.,0

226,"That’s why, should the aliens prove too strong, you can always choose to abandon the timeline you’re currently playing and open a temporal breach back to the start to try again.",1
226,"It’s a neat system, and does soften the blow of failure that more traditional roguelikes deal in by letting you take one of your experienced pilots back with you.",0
226,"You also get one chance per battle to reset a turn, and it’s a testament to how challenging this game is that — although that sounds incredibly powerful — in practice it’s barely enough to keep your head out of the water.",0
226,"Every round, the aliens telegraph their intentions — maybe this one’s going to target this building while those two try to pincer your artillery unit and the last one’s webbing your frontline brawler so that it can’t move at all.",0

226,The terrain can be used against the aliens as well.,0
226,"That’s the beauty of Into the Breach — it gives you so much information and so many tools, and then challenges you to find a way out of the never-ending catastrophe you find yourself in.",0
226,"And that’s why this is such an amazing game — you never feel like you lost because of random chance, or the whims of the RNG gods.",0

NEW YORK: Samsung says its new Galaxy S9 phone features a ""reimagined"" camera, and it is indeed pretty darned good.",0
230,But you might not want to shell out $720 or more for one just yet unless your current phone is already close to death.,0
230,"That's because other high-end phone cameras — nowadays, one of the major differentiators between phones — are also pretty darned good.",0
230,"If your phone is recent, it probably already has a decent camera.",0
230,Technology has improved to the point that it's really hard to tell the difference between them.,0
230,"In many of our test shots, the S9 outperformed the best of its rivals — Apple's iPhone X, Google's Pixel 2 XL and Samsung's own Galaxy Note 8.",0
230,Photos had more detail and less distortion.,0
230,"But unless you magnify images for closer inspection, usually there's little obvious difference beyond color variation, which comes down to personal preference.",0

230,The phone comes out March 16 with a U.S. starting price of $720 through Samsung and T-Mobile and nearly $800 through other major U.S. carriers.,0
230,Here's a look at what the S9 offers.,0
230,"SEE THE LIGHT

In a first for a major smartphone, the S9 camera has an adjustable aperture, or lens opening, to let in more or less light.",0
230,Low-light shots are also improved with software tricks that automatically take 12 shots in quick succession and blend the best of each.,0
230,"These changes produce small improvements in shots: The evening sky tends to be darker, with less distortion.",0
230,A statue of Abraham Lincoln doesn't look as grainy.,0
230,Many S9 shots also have better contrast between dark and light areas.,1
230,But these differences are very subtle.,0
230,What's more likely to affect picture quality is the steadiness of your hands.,0
230,"FREEZING MOTION

The most distinctive feature in Samsung's new camera is super-slow-mo video.",0
230,People appear frozen as they jump.,0
230,Waterfalls seem at peace as drops trickle down.,0
230,The feature offers a fresh perspective on that time-honored prank of having fake snakes pop out of a can — not so scary when the snakes float in thin air.,0
230,"It's a gimmick, but loads of fun.",0
230,The camera can process only a fifth of a second of video at a time — stretched into six seconds when viewing — so auto detection is key to capturing the right moment.,0
230,"It's fun to see people jump up at this speed, but less so when the super-slow-mo part doesn't kick in until they're almost back on the ground.",0
230,There's a lot of trial and error involved.,0
230,"And compared with still images and regular video, super-slow-mo video tends to be darker and blurrier, particularly with close-ups.",0
230,"The feature is at its best outdoors, when lighting is good and the subject in motion is far enough away.",0

230,And it can deal with long passages in posters and documents.,0
230,"YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT

Point the camera at food for nutritional information.",0
230,"It gave me close-enough calorie counts for a burger and onion rings, but a roast beef sandwich was misidentified as either a pastrami or a cubano sandwich, depending on the angle.",0
230,"All counts are based on single servings, which isn't as useful as Bixby telling me the mac and cheese I had was actually three servings, or triple the calories.",0
230,"Unreported calories don't contribute to weight gain, right?",0
230,"WHAT ELSE

The larger S9 Plus model has a second lens with twice the magnification.",0
230,"Though I didn't test this model, a similar feature in other phones is essential for producing better close-ups.",0
230,Both S9 models have a feature for turning selfies into personal emojis for sharing in messages.,0
230,Some people will love this; I found no use for it.,0
230,Next!,0
230,The new phone is easier to unlock by looking at it.,0
230,"Past Samsung phones scan your iris, but they don't work reliably in bright sunlight.",1
230,"The S9 supplements that with facial recognition, which isn't as secure.",0
230,"For that reason, Samsung won't let banking and other sensitive apps use just the face, but it's OK for unlocking the phone (you can disable it if you're concerned).",0
230,"In any case, glasses can still be challenging, but there's a fingerprint sensor on the back as a backup.",0
230,It's moved slightly to reduce smudges on the camera lens.,0
230,"Beyond that, the phone's design hasn't changed much from last year's S8.",0

255,"Sir Richard Branson, the CEO of the LA-based Virgin Hyperloop One touched down in Mumbai last week.",1
255,"There, he signed an MoU with the Maharashtra government to build the world’s first Hyperloop.",0
255,Things began speeding up soon afterwards.,0
255,Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the project’s foundation stone at the Magnetic Maharashtra Global Business Summit on Monday.,0
255,"Once operational, the Hyperloop will link the cities of Mumbai and Pune.",0
255,The travel time between them will shrink to a mere 25 minutes from the present three-and-half hours.,0
255,"However, it’s not all that easy.",0
255,Technical challenges and huge cost involved in building a Hyperloop have given many second thoughts about its viability.,1
255,What is Hyperloop?,0
255,Hyperloop is a futuristic mode of transport proposed by LA-based billionaire investor Elon Musk in 2012.,0
255,"In Hyperloop, pods or containers will carry people at speeds over 1000 km/hr through a low-pressure tube.",1
255,"Musk called it the fifth mode of transport -- the other four being rail, road, air, and water.",0
255,"​

How does it work?",0
255,The pods or containers will float through the tube using magnetic levitation technology.,0
255,"Put simply, magnetic levitation is the use of magnetic force to lift an object and propel it forward.",0
255,Magnets have two oppositely polarised ends - North and South.,0
255,Two poles that are similar repel each other and vice versa.,0
255,This property of magnets is used to push and pull the pods forwards.,0
255,The technique has been around for quite some time and is presently used to levitate and float the high-speed Maglev rail networks across Europe.,0
255,How does it help?,0
255,The pods don’t come in touch with any surface.,0
255,This ensures that there is no friction.,0
255,"When the wheels of a train hurtle through a track, it generates a significant amount of friction, which drags the train, leading to increased energy consumption.",0
255,Pods don’t have to deal with friction as they float through a low-pressure tube.,0
255,"Also, the tubes are pumped to near vacuum.",0
255,"This means that there is very little air pressure, and thus, almost no resistance to the forward movement of pods.",0
255,The absence of friction and air pressure enables the pods to travel at much greater speed than a train running through a track.,0
255,How does it help?,0
255,The biggest advantage of Hyperloop is that it saves times.,0
255,But what about money?,0
255,"Every day, nearly 1.5 lakh vehicles travel from Pune to Mumbai.",0
255,"Hyperloop will not only reduce traffic congestion on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, but also cut down on carbon emission by 150,000 tonnes annually, claims Virgin Hyperloop One.",1
255,Economic benefits are also abounding.,0
255,"Richard Branson, the CEO of the Virgin Hyperloop One has claimed that the economic benefits accrued to India due to time and energy saved and increased productivity would amount to Rs 3.5 lakh crore over 30 years.",0
255,There is no way to test his claim as the world is yet to have its first operational Hyperloop system.,0
255,"Also, high-speed commute means one could travel from his/her home in Pune to workplace in Mumbai in a matter of less than half an hour.",0
255,This may reduce the housing congestion in Mumbai and might help bring down the cost of housing there.,0
255,"Moreover, faster connectivity will help cities push their frontiers and accelerate the pace of their economic growth.",0
255,"For instance, businesses and manufacturers catering to Pune would benefit if the city becomes a key residential hub for those working in Mumbai.",0
255,"Also, it would become a key investment destination.",0
255,"Businessmen, eager to cash in on Pune’s expanding middle class, would throng to the city, leading to its expansion.",0
255,Will it benefit an average person?,0
255,We don’t know yet.,0
255,Richard Branson aims to make Hyperloops affordable for everyone.,0
255,"“We are not pricing this for the wealthy, but it will be for the masses,” he said.",0
255,Experts are skeptical though.,0
255,"To begin with, it is still a concept that has not yet been successfully implemented.",0
255,"So, it is not easy to get a realistic estimate.",0
255,"Last year, the US Department of Transportation noted in a feasibility study that the “Cost estimates for a land-based Hyperloop system may appear lower than other modes, but as the technology is still conceptual and in very initial testing, there is uncertainty in both the underlying infrastructure needed to operate a system and the cost to construct it.”

Estimates vary, but almost everyone agrees that the capital cost for a project of this scale would be very huge.",0
255,Just how huge?,0
255,Leaked documents from Hyperloop One puts the cost at $120 million or Rs 780 crore per mile.,0
255,"In other words, building a 100-mile-long (160 km) Hyperloop system would cost approximately seventy-eight thousand crore rupees.",0
255,Anybody investing so much money into a project would want to recover it in the long run.,0
255,"Although Elon Musk claimed that the ticket for a journey between L.A. and San Francisco could be priced as low as $20 (Rs 1300), many believe this would be a bad idea, if the Hyperloop is to be profitable for the investor.",0
255,Many academics have also come forward expressing their skepticism about the project’s financial viability.,0
255,"Bent Flyvbjerg, an economist specialising in mega-projects at Oxford University agrees that it would be extremely difficult to make such a project financially viable.",0
255,"Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard University echoes Flyvbjerg.",0
255,"“It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision,” he says.",0
255,Is it technically viable?,0
255,"Cost aside, technological challenges pose major hurdles.",0
255,The idea of a pod floating through a near-vacuum tube is not very far fetched.,0
255,But there are numerous other issues that need to be tackled.,0
255,“The biggest concern with this plan has to do with temperature.,0
255,The pod will be compressing air and expelling it downwards and backward.,0
255,"All that air compression creates an enormous amount of heat, which can damage the pod and its machinery,” writes Sam Jaffe, Managing Director of Cairn Energy Research Advisors.",0

263,"""AI offers us the potential for new, less invasive tests for heart health -- predicting cardiovascular results from retinal images with computer vision -- encouraging early results!,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on Tuesday while referring the study in a tweet.",1
263,"The study, published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering, showed that deep learning applied to a retinal fundus image, a photograph that includes the blood vessels of the eye, can predict risk factors for heart diseases -- from blood pressure to smoking status.",0
263,"The algorithm that the researchers produced can even help predict the occurrence of a future major cardiovascular event on par with current measures, said Michael McConnell, Head of Cardiovascular Health Innovations at Verily in blog post.",0
263,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally and researchers know that lifestyle factors including exercise and diet in combination with genetic factors, age, ethnicity, and sex all contribute to it.",0
263,"However, they do not exactly know how these factors add up in a particular individual, and so in some patients it becomes essential to perform sophisticated tests, like coronary calcium CT scans, to help better stratify an individual's risk for having a heart attack or a stroke, and such other cardiovascular events.",0
263,"In this study, using deep learning algorithms trained on data from 284,335 patients, the researchers were able to predict cardiovascular risk factors from retinal images with surprisingly high accuracy for patients from two independent datasets of 12,026 and 999 patients.",0
263,"The algorithm could distinguish the retinal images of a smoker from that of a non-smoker 71 per cent of the time, the study found.",1
263,"""In addition, while doctors can typically distinguish between the retinal images of patients with severe high blood pressure and normal patients, our algorithm could go further to predict the systolic blood pressure within 11 mmHg on average for patients overall, including those with and without high blood pressure,"" study co-author Lily Peng, Product Manager, Google Brain Team, said.",0
263,"""One of the exciting aspects of this study is the generation of 'attention maps' to show which aspects of the retina contributed most to the algorithm, thus providing a window into the 'black box' often associated with machine learning,"" McConnell, who is also a co-author of the study, said.",0
263,"This can give clinicians greater confidence in the algorithm, and potentially provide new insights into retinal features not previously associated with cardiovascular risk factors or future risk, McConnell said.",1
263,"The findings suggest that a simple retinal image could one day help understand the health of a patient's blood vessels, key to cardiovascular health.",1

270,"They work very hard to create a favourable online image, showed the findings published in the Journal of Research on Adolescence.",0
270,"According to the researchers, content that makes them appear interesting, well-liked and attractive to their friends and peers is a primary goal for adolescents when deciding what to share in digital spaces.",1
270,"""Teenagers aren't just posting carelessly; they're surprisingly thoughtful about what they choose to reveal on social media,"" said the lead author of the study Joanna Yau from the University of California, Irvine.",1
270,"""Peer approval is important during adolescence, especially in early adolescence, so they're sharing content that they think others will find impressive,"" Yau added.",1
270,"Facebook and Instagram provide opportunities for young people to connect and communicate with friends as well as people they know in person but are not necessarily close to, such as classmates.",0

271,WASHINGTON D.C: A new stretchable electronics has been found for stroke recovery treatment which has proven to be a game changer.,1
271,A groundbreaking new wearable designed to be worn on the throat could have been developed in the field of stroke rehabilitation in the Northwestern University.,1
271,"The new technology’s sensor is the latest in Professor John A. Rogers' growing portfolio of stretchable electronics that are precise enough for use in advanced medical care and portable enough to be worn outside the hospital, even during extreme exercise.",0
271,"Rogers' sensors stick directly to the skin, moving with the body and providing detailed health metrics including heart function, muscle activity, and quality of sleep.",1
271,"""Stretchable electronics allow us to see what is going on inside patients' bodies at a level traditional wearables simply cannot achieve"", Rogers said.",0
271,"""The key is to make them as integrated as possible with the human body.""",0

271,"""Our sensors solve that problem by measuring vibrations of the vocal chords"", Rogers said.",0
271,"""But they only work when worn directly on the throat, which is a very sensitive area of the skin.",0
271,"We developed novel materials for this sensor that bend and stretch with the body, minimizing discomfort to patients"".",0
271,"Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, a research hospital in Chicago, who collaborated with Rodgers for the research, used the throat sensor in conjunction with electronic biosensors - also developed in Rogers' lab - on the legs, arms and chest to monitor stroke patients' recovery progress.",0
271,"The intermodal system of sensors streamed data wirelessly to clinicians' phones and computers, providing a quantitative, full-body picture of patients' advanced physical, and physiological responses in real time.",0
271,"""One of the biggest problems we face with stroke patients is that their gains tend to drop off when they leave the hospital"", said Arun Jayaraman, a research scientist at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab.",0
271,"""With the home monitoring enabled by these sensors, we can intervene at the right time, which could lead to better, faster recoveries for patients"".",0
271,"Because the sensors are wireless, they eliminated barriers posed by traditional health monitoring devices in clinical settings.",0
271,Data from the sensors would be presented in a dashboard that is easy for both clinicians and patients to understand.,0
271,It would send alerts when patients are underperforming on a certain metric and would allow them to set and track progress toward their goals.,0

288,Triboelectric charging occurs when certain materials become electrically charged after coming into contact with a different material.,0
288,Most everyday static electricity is triboelectric.,0
288,"The tab consists of two thin layers of gold, with polydimethylsiloxane (also called PDMS -- a silicon-based polymer used in contact lenses, Silly Putty and other products) sandwiched in between.",0
288,"One layer of gold is stretched, causing it to crumple upon release and create what looks like a miniature mountain range.",0
288,"When that force is reapplied, for example, from a finger bending, the motion leads to friction between the gold layers and PDMS.",1

296,The diet recommends eating three meals and two snacks.,0
296,"The diet restricts calorie intake and limits it to 1,200 to 1,500 per day

weight loss diets is a very confusing one.",0
296,"There are countless 'scientifically-devised' meal plans and nutrition plans out there, which promise to get you just a little bit closer to your body goals.",0
296,"If you're someone who has been trying to lose weight for a while now, you may know how utterly baffling it can be to figure out which diet plan works and which doesn't.",0
296,"But, the most important point to remember is that any diet plan you follow, it must aid weight loss in a healthy manner, without depriving your body of essential nutrients.",0
296,There is one particular diet that promises to reduce inflammation in the body by making you eat all the essential nutrients.,0
296,"The Zone Diet recommends that you eat five times day, so as to prevent 'overeating,' which often happens when you only eat three meals per day.",0
296,"The zone diet is a low carb diet and was designed by a biochemist, Barry Sears.",1
296,"He has published dozens of books on the diet, making it gain traction worldwide.",0
296,"So, what is the Zone Diet?",0
296,What Is The 'Zone Diet'?,0
296,"The official website of Sears' Zone Diet describes 'zone' as a ""real physiological state in your body that can be measured in clinical tests.""",1
296,"It further adds, ""If you are in the Zone, you have optimised your ability to control diet-induced inflammation.""",0
296,The website also defines three 'clinical markers' that indicate whether you're in the zone or not.,0
296,"These markers include: Triglyceride to High Density lipoproteins, or HDL, cholesterol ratio, AA to EPA ratio, which defines the presence of the two essential fatty acids in blood, and finally, percentage of glycated haemoglobin, or HbA1c.",0
296,"Sears has given a value to all three markers, and he theorises that if these three values are met, then your body is in the 'Zone'.",0
296,"He has also listed the alleged benefits of the Zone Diet as loss of excess body fat, better performance, increased thinking capabilities, as well as slowed process of ageing.",0
296,"To reap the benefits of this diet, Sears recommends that one balance every meal with one-third protein, two-thirds vegetable and fruit carbs, and a dash of fat.",0
296,What Can You Eat In The 'Zone Diet'?,0
296,"There aren't many foods that are off-limits in the zone diet, except foods like pastas and breads, as well as fruits that are high in sugar.",0
296,People who follow the diet generally eat three meals and two snacks per day.,0
296,"The main foods include sources of lean proteins like salmon, carbohydrates from vegetables, and small amounts of good fat from olive oil, walnuts, avocados, etc.",0
296,"Zone diet evangelists believe that the diet restricts their calorie intake to 1,200 to 1,500 per day.",1
296,Also Read: The Alkaline Diet: Does it Really Work for Weight Loss?,0
296,Does Zone Diet Work?,1
296,"There's no sound research or scientific evidence, or any peer-reviewed study that proves that the zone diet improves metabolism or quickens fat burn.",1
296,"The only thing that works in its favour is that it restricts calorie-intake while promoting satiety, both of which are indicators of a good weight loss diet.",0
296,"But, then again, any diet that restricts calorie intake may result in weight loss.",0
296,It's always advisable to consult your physician before following any 'fad diet.',0

313,"Privacy experts said the disclosure that a researcher had sold Facebook data collected via a personality quiz to the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica is a prime example of the kinds of practices that the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is supposed to prevent or punish.",0
313,The danger faced by Facebook going forward is two-fold: Complying with the rules means letting European users opt out of the highly targeted online ads that have made Facebook a money machine.,1
313,Violating GDPR mandates could subject the California company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues.,0
313,"Facebook-Cambridge Analytica Scandal Explained in 10 Simple Points

Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on May 25, it ""would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue"", said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems.",0
313,"Because a UK company was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, GDPR would have applied.",0
313,"Shares in Facebook fell on Monday by 7 percent, their biggest drop since 2014, wiping nearly $40 billion off the value of the firm founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg.",0
313,Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users.,1
313,Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015.,1
313,"Schrems has founded a non-profit, called None Of Your Business (NOYB), that is hiring lawyers and exploring avenues for ""strategic litigation"" over GDPR privacy violations.",1
313,"According to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who formerly worked with Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm used the data to help then-US presidential candidate Donald Trump to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.",0
313,"""The fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn't adequately monitoring what third-parties were doing,"" said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild.",0
313,Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices.,0
313,"Facebook said it changed its policies in 2014 to ""to give much less data, especially about friends,"" Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth said in a Facebook post on Monday.",0
313,"""We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,"" the company said on Monday.",0

313,Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser reiterated his 'sell' rating on Facebook after the weekend reports.,0
313,Wieser expressed concerns that the company's regulatory risks would intensify and that its sophisticated use of data in advertising was in jeopardy.,0
313,A December 2017 survey found that only 21 percent of European consumers know what GDPR is.,0
313,"But after the regulation was explained, 82 percent of respondents said they plan to exercise their new rights, according to the survey of 7,000 Europeans conducted by Cambridge, Mass.-based Pegasystems, which makes sales and marketing software.",0

313,"Giving consumers control

The quandary for Facebook is readily apparent from a video it began showing customers in February: it teaches people how to delete their accounts.",0
313,"GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies.",0
313,"Social networks will also need to regain Europeans' consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising.",0
313,"Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.",0
313,"""There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,"" she told Reuters.",0
313,"Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next.",0
313,"For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face.",0
313,The company did not make those features available in Europe.,0
313,Facebook did not specify a reason.,0
313,But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor.,0
313,Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions.,0
313,"The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented ""in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.""",0
313,"In other words, the days of extensive ""terms of service"" agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, numerous data privacy lawyers told Reuters.",1
313,"In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more ""permissions screens"" and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature.",0
313,"That could depress usage, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said at an investor conference last month.",0

318,"The death of a pedestrian hit by a self-driving Uber vehicle in Arizona this week could offer a test of who can be held legally responsible for accidents when a human is no longer at the wheel, legal experts said.",0
318,"Any litigation that arises from the accident, the first fatality involving a fully autonomous vehicle, could pit the ride-hailing service against technology suppliers and the vehicle's manufacturer, legal experts said.",1
318,It could also provide a window into confidential indemnification agreements that companies developing self-driving car systems may have reached to shield themselves legally.,0
318,"In Sunday's accident, Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bicycle outside the crosswalk on a four-lane road in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe when she was hit by the Volvo XC90 SUV, which was travelling in autonomous mode at about 40 miles per hour, police said.",0
318,"Tempe Police Chief Sylvia Moir, who saw video of the crash, told the San Francisco Chronicle late Monday that it ""would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode (autonomous or human-driven) based on how she came from the shadows right into the roadway.""",0
318,The Tempe Police Department said in a statement later that the department does not determine fault in vehicle collisions.,0
318,"""Ultimately the investigation will be submitted to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office for review and any potential charges,"" it said.",0
318,It was not clear whether a lawsuit would be filed on behalf of Herzberg's estate.,0
318,"Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina with expertise in self-driving cars, said most states, including Arizona, require drivers to exercise due care to avoid hitting pedestrians on a roadway, even if the pedestrians use an unmarked crosswalk.",0
318,"Sergei Lemberg, a California-based lawyer who has brought several lawsuits against self-driving car manufacturers, said that Uber, Volvo, which manufactured the sport utility vehicle, and any companies that supplied self-driving technology could potentially be held liable if litigation ensued from the Tempe accident.",0
318,"The ""safety"" driver who was behind the wheel but who appears not to have operated the vehicle could also be named as a defendant, Lemberg said.",0
318,"""Suing all these parties would be my top thought right now,"" he said.",0
318,Uber said in a statement it was fully cooperating with local authorities investigating the accident.,0
318,"Volvo, the Swedish car brand owned by China's Geely, confirmed its vehicle was involved in the crash but said the software controlling the SUV was not its own.",0
318,Volvo said in 2015 it would accept full liability when one of its vehicles equipped with its own self-driving system was in autonomous mode.,0
318,"The company said in 2017 it had agreed to supply Uber with 24,000 self-driving vehicles.",0
318,"Until now, most litigation over non-fatal accidents involving self-driving vehicles has been confidentially settled, according to legal experts.",1
318,A case in which a motorcyclist sued General Motors after a collision last year with one of the company's autonomous test cars in San Francisco is pending.,0
318,GM has said in a statement regarding the lawsuit that in its collision report the San Francisco Police Department determined that the autonomous vehicle was not at fault in the accident.,0
318,Legal experts said liability in the Tempe case would depend on the facts of the accident and the results of U.S. National Highway Safety Administration and National Transportation Safety Board investigations.,0
318,"With no driver, spotlight on design

Car accident litigation usually turns on whether a driver acted negligently, or failed to exercise a reasonable level of care.",0
318,"By contrast, a lawsuit involving an autonomous vehicle could revolve around whether the self-driving system had a design defect, legal experts said.",1
318,Design defect claims do not require a finding of fault or negligence.,0
318,"To prevail, a plaintiff must show only that a product had an inherent design defect that would render it unsafe.",0
318,"Automakers and software writers could counter with detailed data gathered by on-board sensors on how cars behaved during a collision, experts said, to show that it was impossible for the vehicle to avoid a collision and that all the systems functioned properly.",0
318,"One question that would likely arise in litigation is whether Uber, Volvo or any companies that supplied self-driving technology entered into indemnification agreements, in which an entity assumes another company's liability costs.",0
318,"Paul Rafferty, a California-based lawyer who represents carmakers, said such agreements in the autonomous vehicle world are confidential and disputes over indemnification are generally arbitrated or mediated behind closed doors.",0
318,Volvo declined to comment on whether it had entered into indemnification agreements with Uber.,0
318,"Jennifer Dukarski, a Detroit-based lawyer representing suppliers of autonomous-vehicle technology, said the lawsuit filed by the San Francisco motorcyclist against GM raised only negligence claims.",0
318,"So if any litigation in the Arizona accident alleges design defect claims, it could set legal precedent and be ""very impactful"" on the nascent autonomous vehicle industry, she said.",1
318,"Regardless of who is at fault, the University of South Carolina's Smith said he would expect Uber, which has faced past scrutiny over its business practices, to settle any litigation quickly to avoid the public spotlight.",0

320,Arizona officials said on Tuesday they saw no immediate need to tighten rules on the testing of self-driving cars in the state in reaction to a fatal accident involving an Uber autonomous vehicle that has focused attention on the safety of the new technology.,0
320,"Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp said it will pause autonomous vehicle testing following Sunday's accident in which an Uber Technologies self-driving SUV struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona.",1
320,Automakers and tech companies are evaluating whether or not to suspend their autonomous vehicle programs in the wake of the first fatality involving a self-driving vehicle.,1
320,Uber said on Monday it was suspending its own program.,0
320,"Toyota said it was temporarily pausing its testing on US public roads to help its test drivers, who could be experiencing ""an emotional effect"" from the incident.",0
320,"""This 'timeout' is meant to give them time to come to a sense of balance about the inherent risks of their jobs,"" the automaker said in a statement.",0
320,"Uber, along with other technology companies and automakers, has been testing in Arizona, which regulates autonomous vehicles with a lighter touch than neighbouring states such as California.",0
320,"The state has a long history of allowing automakers to test new vehicles on its wide, open roads, and a 2015 executive order by Governor Doug Ducey paved the way for companies to test autonomous technology without interference by the legislature.",0
320,"More than 600 self-driving vehicles are now testing on Arizona roads, according to the governor's office.",1
320,"On Tuesday, Arizona's director for policy and communications at the state's department of transportation, Kevin Biesty, said existing regulations were sufficient and that the state had no immediate plans to issue new rules.",0
320,"""We believe we have enough in our laws right now to regulate automobiles,"" Biesty told Reuters.",0
320,"""There will be issues that the legislature will have to address in the future as these become more widespread.""",0
320,"During the early phase of self-driving vehicle testing, Arizona refrained from adding new restrictions on companies testing on state roads, Biesty said, adding they did not believe any new regulations would add to safety.",0
320,Biesty said his agency was waiting for federal safety regulators to conclude an investigation before drawing any conclusions.,0
320,"Arizona's self-driving vehicle oversight committee has not planned any meetings or actions, he said.",0
320,"Also on Tuesday, Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell issued a statement saying he supported Uber's decision to suspend testing until the end of the investigation.",0
320,His office said the mayor had not asked other autonomous vehicle companies to suspend testing in the city.,0
320,"Full details are still forthcoming surrounding the death on Sunday night of pedestrian Elaine Herzberg after she was struck by Uber's test vehicle, a Volvo SC 90 sport utility vehicle, operating in autonomous mode.",0
320,"Herzberg, who was homeless, was crossing a four-lane road with her bicycle outside of the crosswalk when she was struck.",0
320,The Maricopa County Attorney's Office in Phoenix said it was awaiting the results of an investigation by Tempe police before reviewing whether any charges should be filed.,0
320,Officials with the National Transportation Safety Board and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also are investigating.,0
320,"The Tempe police department said in a brief statement it ""would like to reaffirm that fault has not been determined in this case.""",0
320,"The NTSB said investigators had viewed video captured by a camera in the Uber vehicle, and were gathering data from the vehicle and Uber.",1
320,A photo posted on Twitter by the NTSB showed the front right corner of the vehicle's hood seriously dented.,0
320,"Investigators will be in Tempe for the rest of the week and will not release findings until reviews of information from the scene and analysis of vehicle data are finished, the agency said.",0
320,Uber's Advanced Technologies Group office in Tempe appeared empty on Tuesday except for a security guard who said only a small security crew was working at the site since the accident.,0
320,The autonomous vehicles normally filling the parking lot outside were nowhere to be seen.,0
320,"The fatality is drawing fresh attention to the safety of autonomous vehicles, and the challenges of testing them on public streets.",0
320,"Self-driving cars have been involved in minor accidents, but nearly all have been blamed on human motorists hitting the autonomous vehicle.",0
320,The outcome of the investigations in Arizona will be pivotal for companies racing to profit from robo-taxi services and automated delivery vehicles.,0

321,Facebook Messenger has received a bunch of new features to enhance your group chat experience.,1
321,There are admin privileges as well as joinable links and real-time voice and video chats support within groups to make users stick to group conversations on Messenger.,0
321,These new updates are also aimed to uplift the last year's record of supporting the creation of over 2.5 million new groups on a daily basis.,0
321,First in the series of new changes is the availability of admin privileges that add the approval of a group administrator for adding new members.,0
321,"This means any new members will not be a part of the group you've created, without your permission or another admin.",0
321,You need to approve new members from your side to let them start catching up with other members of your group.,0
321,"Further, admins have also been provided with the ability to remove any existing members if needed, and promote or demote a member in the group chat as an admin.",0
321,The option to require admin approval for new members is by default disabled on Facebook Messenger.,0
321,"However, you can enable it by going to your group chat setting.",0
321,"Alongside admin privileges, Facebook Messenger has added joinable links to let you easily invite new people to your group chats.",1
321,Anyone in a group chat can create a custom invite link and share it using either the Messenger app or any third-party messaging app.,1
321,"People who tap the link will either be added to the group instantly, if approvals are off, or will be added after admin approval.",0
321,"To take on group chats on Skype, Facebook Messenger has included real-time voice and video chats in groups with a limit of up to 50 people at a time.",0
321,This is more than the limit of 25 people for a group video chat or conference call on Skype.,1

322,Digital payment systems have ballooned in popularity in India since the government scrapped large-value bank notes in 2016.,0
322,"Among these offerings are applications that enable smartphone users to buy, sell or store gold - even in small amounts - kept in secured vaults operated by MMTC-PAMP India Pvt Ltd, a joint venture between MMTC Ltd, the largest national trading firm, and Swiss gold refiner PAMP.",0
322,"Although online gold purchases have been growing globally for years, they are a relatively recent phenomenon in India, where jewellery and bars of the precious metal tend to be kept in hand and given as gifts.",0
322,"""In India, the action is really starting now.",0
322,"The digitisation of the economy will certainly lead to digitisation of gold,"" said Somasundaram PR cq, Managing Director of World Gold Council's (WGC) India operations.",0
322,"""It is poised for significant growth, possibly in the next 12-24 months.""",0
322,"The WGC estimated total Indian gold demand at 727 tonnes (25.6 million ounces) in 2017, and could be up to 800 tonnes in 2018.",0
322,"In China, the top consumer, 2017 demand was 953.3 tonnes.",0
322,It is difficult to gauge how many new buyers are entering the market because of online access.,0
322,"The e-wallet operator Paytm said that in the first six months after it began offering digital gold last April, it facilitated about $18.4 million (roughly Rs.",1
322,120 crores) worth of sales - a tiny fraction of the Indian gold market.,0
322,"With the vast majority of purchases made in the traditional way, demand for physical gold isn't abating, ""especially when physical gold plays an important role at Indian weddings,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK Ltd.",0
322,"Newly attractive

Besides convenience, Indian consumers are attracted to competitive pricing and ability to make purchases in tiny increments.",0
322,"Gold-based financial offerings, including Gold Accumulation Plans (GAPs), allow users to buy and store gold in fractions as small as 0.1 grams - an amount that would be an uneconomical to trade physically because of the associated handling costs.",0
322,"These accumulation plans, along with gold-backed bonds and websites selling coins and jewellery that can be shipped for free or cheaply within India, are especially appealing to young Indians.",0
322,"In the past, even those with an enduring affinity for gold have needed to wait until they have saved enough to build holdings.",0
322,"Joe Jacob, a 29-year-old entrepreneur in the southern city of Bengaluru, recently bought 5 rupees (8 cents) worth of digital gold as a ""trial investment.""",1
322,"""Physical gold is a hassle in terms of storage, and I don't wear gold, but understand it is an asset to hold.",0
322,"Digital gold is better than storing the actual metal at home, worrying about its safety,"" he said.",1
322,"Security experts said that because the gold, guaranteed to physically exist in an MMTC PAMP vault, was insured, there was little risk of fraudulent sales.",0
322,And digital wallet providers expect interest to grow.,0
322,Paytm leads the crowded e-wallet space in India and announced two new gold gift and savings plans this month after launching its first digital gold product in April 2017.,0
322,"The company, backed by Japan's SoftBank Group and China's Alibaba, sources its 24-carat gold from MMTC PAMP.",0
322,"""There is no 'season' for this product; it is running twenty-four seven.",0
322,"Sitting in their offices, homes or wherever they want, they can easily access, buy sell or redeem,"" said Gaurav Singh, Deputy General Manager of Marketing at MMTC PAMP.",0
322,"Gold trading traditionally peaks around festival and wedding seasons, experts say.",0
322,But Singh added that because digital gold lowers the minimum price needed to buy gold - from about Rs.,1
322,"3,000 previously, enough to buy roughly 1 gram of gold at current prices - and boosts market transparency via live pricing, there has been a rise in the frequency of gold purchases at other times of the year.",0
322,"Nitin Misra, Senior Vice President at Paytm confirmed a similar trend, noting ""about 40 percent of sales"" happen during the ""off-season"" for buying gold in India.",0
322,"He said more than half of the company's users were repeat customers, and 70 percent were younger than 35.",0
322,"As of December 2017, about 1.4 million of its customers held some gold balance in their e-accounts.",0
322,"""We have stumbled upon a brand new segment,"" he said of younger users buying gold.",0
322,"""What we have done, is not cannibalize the existing market, but grown it.""",0
322,The company said last year it planned to sell $200 million (roughly Rs.,0
322,"1,300 crores) worth of gold in the 2017 fiscal year, which ended March 1.",0
322,But its reported sales in 2017 appeared to be headed far short of that number.,0
322,Its rival e-wallet provider PhonePe was upbeat.,0
322,"""The gold consumption market is expected to grow by 35 percent from 2015 to 2020, and customers are exploring digital options for purchase,"" it said in an emailed statement.",0
322,"For Bangalore-based P Vinoth, a logistics consultant who still prefers buying ornaments and jewellery from retail stores, e-wallets now offer an alternative.",0

326,"Self-driving cars have claimed their first pedestrian fatality, a woman in Tempe, Arizona, who was struck and killed by an Uber vehicle travelling in autonomous mode.",0
326,Weren't self-driving cars supposed to be safer than those piloted by fallible humans?,1
326,And who says they aren't?,0
326,"As many on social media rushed to point out, more than 37,000 people were killed by human-piloted vehicles in 2016.",0
326,"Compared with that, one pedestrian fatality, however sad, looks pretty good.",0
326,This argument is appealing.,0
326,"Unfortunately, it's wrong.",0
326,"Motor vehicle fatalities are measured in terms of ""vehicle miles travelled,"" which is just what it sounds like.",0
326,"In 2016, there were 1.18 fatalities for every 100 million miles that Americans drove.",0
326,"Since Americans drove nearly 3.2 trillion miles that year, that still added up to tens of thousands of deaths.",0
326,"To know whether self-driving cars are safer than the traditional kind, you'd have to know how many miles they travelled before incurring this first fatality.",0
326,"And the answer is "" fewer than 100 million"" - a lot fewer.",0
326,"Waymo, the industry leader, recently reported logging its 4 millionth mile of road travel, with much of that in Western states that offer unusually favourable driving conditions.",0
326,Uber just reached 2 million miles with its autonomous program.,0
326,"Other companies are working on fully autonomous systems, but adding them all together couldn't get us anywhere close to 100 million.",0
326,"(The numbers go up if you add Tesla's autopilot, but that system has more limited capabilities, and fatality statistics don't necessarily get any clearer - or more favourable - if you do.)",0
326,"One fatality at these numbers of road-miles driven does not suggest, to put it mildly, a safety improvement over humans.",0
326,"It's more like dramatic step backward, or if you like, a high-speed reverse.",0
326,Which is not to say that we should pull the plug on autonomous driving.,0
326,"For one thing, regular old-fashioned cars were none too safe when they first arrived on American roads.",0
326,"In 1921, the first year for which such data is available, there were 24 deaths for every 100 million vehicle miles travelled.",0
326,"Over time, improved cars, drivers and roads reduced that figure by nearly 95 percent.",0
326,"Presumably, self-driving cars can also improve.",0
326,"Given their other benefits, it's worth working for those improvements, regardless of whether these cars are currently less safe than human drivers.",1
326,"Think of all the elderly forced to leave their homes when they can no longer drive, the people whose disabilities make it hard or impossible for them to operate a car, the barroom drunks who get behind the wheel because there's no easy way to get home.",0
326,"Autonomous vehicles promise to solve these major problems; we should pursue that promise, even at the temporary cost of some road safety now.",0
326,Especially since it's not clear that there is actually a cost in road safety.,0
326,The glib insistence that self-driving cars are safer than human drivers is not well-founded - but neither is a counterreaction that insists that they're obviously much more dangerous.,1
326,"Even if you could design a system that you knew would have one fatal accident every hundred million miles on average (roughly the same as a human driver), that wouldn't mean that the car would strike and kill someone just as the odometer hit 100 million.",0
326,"The accident might occur on mile 5 million, or mile 99 million - or heck, you might get lucky and not have a fatality until mile 115 million.",0
326,It's not possible to confidently assess the risk of an accident based on a single event like this.,0
326,Statistical regularities that are apparent in large data pools get lost in the noise when the sample is too small.,0
326,We won't know how dangerous self-driving cars are compared with human drivers until they've driven billions more miles.,1
326,"At the moment, we just know that they can kill people, not how often they will.",0
326,And that's a possibility that advocates for self-driving cars should have prepared the public for better than they have.,0
326,"Enthusiasts for autonomous vehicles have been a little too quick to respond to safety concerns by pointing out how many accidents human drivers have - or by noting that self-driving cars don't text, or drive drunk, or fall asleep at the wheel.",0
326,"All true, but as they drive more and more miles, we may discover that they have problems humans don't.",0
326,Uber has already pulled its autonomous cars off the road in response to this tragedy.,0
326,"If it hadn't, it seems likely that the public pressure to do so would have been deafening.",0
326,The company - and advocates of autonomous vehicles more generally - will need to put in a lot of work over the next few months restoring public faith in this technology.,0
326,"Luckily, software systems can be re-engineered; even if self-driving cars aren't currently safer than a human driver, there's good reason to expect that one day they will be.",1
326,But we've done that future no service by talking as if it had definitely already arrived.,0
326,"If we tell people that self-driving cars are perfectly safe, and that turns out not to be true, the backlash could drive these vehicles off the road before they're able to deliver on their promise.",0

327,"China is on its way to becoming the world leader in international patent filings, and should overtake the top spot from the United States within three years, the UN said Wednesday.",1
327,"A record 243,500 international patent applications were filed last year, a hike of 4.5 percent from a year earlier, the World Intellectual Property Organisation said in its annual report.",0
327,"These patents ""represent the best new technology that is arising in the world,"" WIPO chief Francis Gurry told journalists in Geneva.",0
327,"The US kept the top ranking, which it has held for the past four decades, with American-based companies and individuals filing 56,624 applications, or nearly a quarter of the global total.",0
327,"But it was the rapid growth in international patent filings from China, which passed Japan to reach second place, that drove the global increase, WIPO said.",1
327,"Chinese companies and individuals filed a total of 48,882 international patents last year, marking a hike of 13.4 percent from a year earlier, the UN agency said.",0
327,"China, the only country to record double-digit growth in its patent applications in 2017, has posted growth higher than 10 percent every year since 2003.",1
327,"""At current trends, (China) is projected to overtake the US within three years as the largest source of applications filed under WIPO's Patent Cooperation Treaty,"" the agency said.",1
327,"""One cannot but notice that there has been a remarkable transformation in the Chinese economy, and that China has gone from a position of being largely a user of technologies to a producer of technologies,"" Gurry said.",0
327,He refused to comment on whether US President Donald Trump's expressed anxiety over competition from China was warranted.,0
327,"But he told reporters that ""China has clearly arrived as a major competitor in the field of technology.""",0
327,"He stressed though that ""the rise of China does not necessarily mean the decline of others.""",0
327,"Two China-based telecoms companies topped the global ranking last year: Huawei Technologies, which filed 4,024 patents, and ZTE Corporation, which filed 2,965.",0
327,"They were followed by Intel Corporation of the United States, with 2,637 patents and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation of Japan, with 2,521.",0
327,"The ""rapid rise in Chinese use of the international patent system shows that innovators there are increasingly looking outward, seeking to spread their original ideas into new markets as the Chinese economy continues its rapid transformation,"" Gurry said in a statement.",0
327,"""This is part of a larger shift in the geography of innovation, with half of all international patent applications now originating in East Asia,"" he added.",1

328,"As per previous reports, the Cupertino giant is expected to launch three iPhone variants this year - a 6.5-inch OLED model, a 6.1-inch LCD model, and a 5.8-inch OLED model.",1
328,"According to new information, the 5.8-inch variant of the 2018 iPhone will be cheaper to manufacture, despite the OLED display.",1
328,This could be an indication for Apple fans to expect a price drop from the massive $999 price point of the iPhone X that was launched last year.,0
328,"Digitimes Research analyst Luke Lin said in a research note, the new 5.8-inch model of the iPhone will have a total bill of materials (MBOM) over 10 percent lower than the iPhone X had when it was initially launched.",0
328,Lin says in the report that the iPhone X MBOM was more than $400 in 2017.,1
328,"Due to this cost reduction, the report says, ""Apple may position the new 5.85-inch device as the cheapest model of all three next-generation iPhone models.""",0
328,"Interestingly, Lin says Apple had previously planned to bring another LCD version of the 5.85-inch iPhone.",0
328,"However, the project was suspended ""mid-February and may be eventually terminated.""",0
328,"The company was reportedly planning to launch the LCD version of the handset ""due to MBOM concerns.""",0
328,"The report also added that, due to a weak demand of the iPhone X, Apple took fewer OLED panels from Samsung Display, which resulted in ""more bargaining chips"" for the latter in negotiations for the manufacturing of 2018 iPhone.",0
328,"While this could have led to price increments, the report claims that Apple has already reached an agreement with Samsung Display ""with satisfactory terms.""",0
328,Lin believes that the 5.85-inch OLED iPhone can be launched as the cheapest of the three new models.,1
328,He says that engineering samples have shown that this particular model has adopted components with lower specs than in the 6.1-inch LCD iPhone.,1

385,"""That's why we thought of the idea of the unforgettable bag - it's a bit of a push for them,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.The new bags will be sold for 0.50 ringgit ($0.13) each, and customers will get a free replacement if the bag is torn or damaged.",1
385,"Tesco will offer customers a cash rebate of 0.20 ringgit ($0.05) for every bag reused.Each year between 500 billion and 1 trillion plastic bags are used globally, according to industry estimates, with fewer than 10 percent recycled.",1
385,"Many end up in the world's oceans or dumped in landfill.More than 8 million tonnes of plastics enter the ocean each year, and marine experts fear there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050, measured by weight.Plastic degrades over time into tiny particles which are ingested by marine life, harming the food chain and environment.In an attempt to cut down on waste and single-use plastic, many supermarkets around the world charge customers for plastic bags, promote reusable bags, and offer free recycling services.Meanwhile, more than 40 countries have banned, partly banned or taxed single-use plastic bags, including parts of Malaysia and India, China, France, Rwanda, Italy and Kenya.The ""unforgettable bag"" is made from a recyclable plastic that is more durable than conventional plastic bags, Tesco said, and sports a turtle, fish or whale design to highlight the risks plastic waste poses to sea creatures.The Tesco trial - the first of its kind by a major hypermarket in Malaysia - limits the bag discounts to two per transaction.The scheme will be extended to all Tesco's 56 stores in Malaysia from June 1.",0

386,"Today, only the jawless lampreys have four eyes, according to researchers at Senckenberg Research Institute in Germany The third and fourth eyes refer to pineal and parapineal organs, eye-like photosensory structures on the top of the head that play key roles in orientation and in circadian and annual cycles.The new findings help to elucidate the evolutionary history of these structures among vertebrates, researchers said.The photosensitive pineal organ is found in a number of lower vertebrates such as fishes and frogs, they said.It is often referred to as the ""third eye"" and was widespread in primitive vertebrates.",1
386,"""On the one hand, there was this idea that the third eye was simply reduced independently in many different vertebrate groups such as mammals and birds and is retained only in lizards among fully land-dwelling vertebrates,"" said Krister Smith from the Senckenberg Research Institute.",1
386,"""On the other hand, there was this idea that the lizard third eye developed from a different organ, called the parapineal, which is well developed in lampreys.",1
386,"These two ideas did not really cohere,"" Smith said.By discovering a four-eyed lizard - in which both pineal and parapineal organs formed an eye on the top of the head - the researchers confirmed that the lizard third eye really is different from the third eye of other jawed vertebrates.Smith and his colleagues got the idea that the fossilised lizards might have a fourth eye after other experts came to contradictory conclusions about where the lizard's third eye was located.Smith and colleagues turned to museum specimens collected nearly 150 years ago as part of the Yale College Expedition to the Bridger Basin, Wyoming in the US.CT scans showed that two different individuals had spaces where a fourth eye would have been, which, Smith said, ""I certainly did not expect!""",0
386,"Their evidence confirms that the pineal and parapineal glands were not a pair of organs in the way that vertebrate eyes are.They also suggest that the third eye of lizards evolved independently of the third eye in other vertebrate groups.Smith said that while there is ""nothing mystical"" about the pineal and parapineal organs, they do enable extraordinary abilities.For instance, they allow some lower vertebrates to sense the polarisation of light and use that information to orient themselves geographically.",1

388,"Rather than jogging on by the garbage littered on the street, ploggers pick it up and dispose of it correctly instead.To plog even more effectively, some ploggers fit in some additional exercises as they bend to pick up litter — to keep their heart rate pumping.",1
388,"And it turns out the exercise really pays off — for the environment and your body.According to fitness app Lifesum, which allows users to input and track calories burned while plogging , the eco-friendly work-out is significantly more effective than just jogging.As plogging requires some bending and arm strength to hold all the garbage, a half hour of plogging will burn 288 calories on average - compared to just 235 calories from regular jogging.On social media, the plogging craze is also gaining popularity as people share photos of the trash they’ve collected or realise that they’ve actually been plogging all along.",0

390,The community forest resource (CFR) rights provision of the Act empowers forest-dwelling tribal communities to protect and manage forests.,1
390,"Community rights have been recognised in less than 3% of forests so far, says Community Forest Rights—Learning and Advocacy Group, a coalition of organisations.",0
390,"But some of the success stories have been documented by Centre for Science and Environment in its ‘People’s Forests’ report released last week.Shruti Agarwal of CSE says: “These are stories of community empowerment, which suggest that a new future of democratic forest governance is emerging.",0
390,"They create confidence in the ability of communities to manage and conserve their forests, and to generate sustainable livelihoods from them.”In 2012, the tribal villages of Nayakheda, Payvihir, Upatkheda and Khatijapur were given charge of a highly degraded forest area of 990ha.",0
390,Even the assistant conservator of forests of Amravati admits they “received the worst forests”.,0
390,"In the first year, villagers focused on planting bamboo and moisture conservation.",0
390,"They weeded out invasive species like lantana and non-useful trees like gum tree, planted by the forest department.",0
390,"In Payvihir village, they put a stop to the department’s auction of custard apple trees for a meagre Rs 1,500, and began marketing the fruit themselves, earning Rs 16,000 in the first year.",0
390,"“These villages have identified forest patches to be kept untouched from any intervention to observe the biodiversity and evolution of natural flora and fauna… Nayakheda has built watering holes for wildlife,” observes the CSE report.",0

390,"The villagers have started working on ways to avoid forest fires, plant indigenous species, and manage water conservation.The lives of women in Madhikol changed after the village got CFR rights in 2016.",0
390,"The gram sabha, consisting of six men and six women, framed rules for patrolling of forests, protection from fires and sustainable harvest of forest produce.",1
390,The practice of burning tendu bushes before the plucking season was stopped as the fire destroyed new plants of other important species.,0
390,"Earlier, tribal women would stitch siali leaves into plates and sell them to middlemen at a throwaway price of Rs 10 for 80 plates.",0
390,"In 2016, they formed a collective and began exporting the plates, earning Rs 50,000.",0
390,Panchgaon was the first village in the district to get CFR rights.,0
390,The village mandated each household to come up with at least five ideas for management of the forests.,0
390,"Eventually, 115 regulations were finalised.",0
390,"“Thus, the entire village was party to the decisions taken and the gram sabha’s success in governing its CFRs can be partly attributed to this inclusive and democratic approach,” says the report.",0
390,Voluntary patrolling of forests is mandatory here.,0
390,"The most important decision of the gram sabha was a ban on removal of tendu leaves, forgoing huge revenue.",0

398,"They increased membrane protein folding in water during protein translation and preserved water-soluble protein activity in organic solvents.The researchers at Northwestern University in the US ran extensive molecular simulations to show that the RHP would interact favourably with protein surfaces, wrap around protein surfaces in organic solvents and weakly in water, leading to correct protein folding and stability in a non-native environment.They then tested whether they can use an RHP to create protein-based materials for bioremediation of toxic chemicals, which they were funded to do by the Department of Defense.They mixed RHP with a protein called organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH), which degrades the toxic organophosphates found in insecticides and chemical warfare agents.The researchers used the RHP/OPH combination to make fibre mats, submersed the mats in a well-known insecticide and found that the mats degraded an amount of insecticide weighing approximately one-tenth of the total fibre mat in just a few minutes.This opens the door to the creation of larger mats that could soak up toxic chemicals in places like war zones.",0

403,"NEW YORK: The world's fisheries will be, on average, 20 per cent less productive in the year 2300, according to a study.This bleak future will be characterised by 9.6 degrees Celsius increase in mean surface air temperature, nearly 10 times the warming we have seen to this point.The extended climate warming will drastically alter wind patterns, boost ocean surface temperatures and melt nearly all the sea ice in polar regions.",1
403,"""These conditions will cause changes in phytoplankton growth and ocean circulation around Antarctica , with the net effect of transferring nutrients from the upper ocean to the deep ocean,"" said J Keith Moore from the University of California, Irvine in the US.",1

403,"""By looking at the decline in fish food over time, we can estimate how much our total potential fisheries catch could be reduced,"" said Moore.Months of computations using thousands of central processing units were needed to simulate the climate and oceans up to 2300.According to the findings, published in the journal Science, fisheries in the North Atlantic will be down nearly 60 per cent and those in much of the western Pacific will experience declines of more than 50 per cent in the year 2300.",0

420,"NEW DELHI: India’s forest cover increased by 6,778 sq km over the last two years with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha and Telangana increasing their green footprint during the period though there is a worrying decline in six northeastern states, including a shrinkage of 630 sq km in the eastern Himalayas.While overall green cover, including tree patches outside recorded forest areas, reported an incremental 1% increase (8,021 sq km) over the last assessment year in 2015, the quality of forests remain a hotly debated subject even as satellite monitoring has increased availability of data.The increase, based on satellite data and subsequent ‘ground truthing’, has put the total forest cover at 7,08,273 sq km which is 21.54% of the country’s geographical area.Releasing the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2017 on Monday, the environment ministry looked at the overall green cover (total forest and tree cover) of 8,02,088 sq km and pitched it as a success of multiple afforestation programmes.Though this figure puts green cover at 24.39% of India’s geographical area, this does not reflect a complete picture as it includes tree cover of 93,815 sq km, primarily computed by notional numbers.In the past, studies have argued that the problem of depletion and over-exploitation of forests has taken a toll of India’s forests and their sustainability and the problem of simplifying a maze of rules and tune conservation with the needs of local communities remains a challenge.Taking into account the density (canopy covering branches and foliage formed by the crowns of trees), forest cover is divided into ‘very dense’, ‘moderately dense’ and ‘open’ forest.",0
420,"The ‘very dense’ forest cover has increased over the last assessment of 2015, but the ‘moderately dense’ category reported a decline — a sign which environmentalists consider quite worrying.Referring to decline in the ‘moderately dense’ forest category and enhancement of forest cover in ‘open’ forest and ‘scrub’ categories, forest expert from Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) Ajay Saxena said, “This negative correlation means that India is losing good forests for developmental pressures, forest degradation and climate change.”Saxena termed the increase in ‘very dense’ forest (VDF) cover as a “positive development”, but said a major part could be attributed to increase in the number of districts assessed in the new report compared to 2015.The ISFR updated the number of districts for its assessment from 589 to 633.",0
420,"The ministry, however, claimed that the change in area was calculated “using updated figures” to facilitate comparison on a common methodological platform.Underlining that very dense forest had increased from 85,904 sq km in 2015 to 98,158 sq km, environment and forests minister Harsh Vardhan said, “This is very heartening as VDF absorbs maximum carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.”He said consistent increase in forest cover over the years was in sync with India’s commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change and the country would meet its target of creating additional carbon sink (2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent) through increase in forest and tree cover by 2030.The report showed that forest cover in six north-eastern states — Mizoram, Nagaland , Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Meghalaya and Sikkim — decreased in 2017.",0
420,Experts believe forests in the eastern Himalayas are rich in forest carbon and decline in forest cover in the region could have been avoided.,1

420,"The report, however, for the first time contains information on decadal change in water bodies in forest during 2005-2015, forest fire, production of timber from outside forest, state wise carbon stock in different forest types and density classes.The report notes that there was an increase of 2,647 sq km in the extent of water bodies over the decade (2005-15) with all states and Union Territories (UTs) showing an increase except Arunachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.It shows that overall the extent of water bodies has increased from 14,509 sq km in 2005 to 17,156 sq km in 2015 with Maharashtra (432 sq km), Gujarat (428 sq km) and Madhya Pradesh (389 sq km) figuring as the top three states reporting maximum increase in areas of water bodies including lakes and wetlands.“We wish that in future, extent and change in forest cover vis-e-vis major river basins in the country should be assessed and reported since forest cover is a key parameter to assess the health of our rivers”, said river and water expert, Manoj Misra, of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan.Reacting on report which shows marginal increase in forest cover, Misra said, ""Increase in forest cover is a matter to rejoice unless statistical jugglery is behind the claim.",0

421,"However, this is not the first time an election to the post was necessitated.",1
421,"What writers find discomforting this time, though, is a repeat of the 2003 polls where partisan politics — a ‘Left verus Non-Left’ theme — has resurfaced and taken centrestage at the Akademi.Back in 2003, the presidential contest was between the Bharatiya Jnanpith award-winning writer, Mahasweta Devi , and outgoing vice-president of the Akademi, Gopi Chand Narang.",0
421,"Mahasweta Devi, despite her stature as a doyen of literature and of the work she had done among tribals, was defeated during the elctions.",1
421,"Urdu critic Narang, on the other hand, had won 56 of the 94 votes that were polled.While the non-Left had triumphed then, murmurs within the academy of letters on Monday suggested Kambar’s victory was a reassertion of Sahitya Akademi’s relative autonomy in comparison to the other cultural bodies that have allegedly been infiltrated by right-leaning administrators.Shortly after being declared President of the Sahitya Akademi, Kambar, also the first vice-chancellor of Kannada University in Hampi, said he was looking forward to providing a platform to regional languages in India and to counter the eurocentric thurst on Literature.",0
421,"Kambar also thanked outgoing president Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari and said he will remain committed to taking Sahitya Akademi to greater heights.Over the last few years, Sahitya Akademi has been at the centre of considerable controversy, including the ‘award wapasi’ campaign where writers returned their Sahitya Akademi awards as a mark of protest against the rising culture of intolerance in the country.",1

428,"Excited about the trailer launch, Alia spoke to us about the cinematic and emotional journey of playing Sehmat, an innocent Kashmiri girl who makes the transition to spying for her country after being married off into a Pakistani officer’s family:For me, the best part is that this character is not a Lara Croft.",0
428,"She’s a young, naive girl, who decides to risk her life for her country.",0
428,"This was the most beautiful aspect, because I didn’t have to enact anything.",0
428,Being brave doesn’t mean that you don’t get scared.,0
428,"The sequences were overwhelming, but I wasn’t afraid of holding on and going all the way.",0
428,A lot of technical preparation went into playing Sehmat.,0
428,"I had to improve my Urdu and then unlearn what I had picked up, because I play a Kashmiri and I wasn’t required to speak chaste Urdu or Hindi.",0
428,I even learnt the Morse Code by heart.,0
428,"It was something Meghna believed that I should do authentically, and I feel that it helped me get perfectly into the character.",1
428,"One could have argued that kisi ko kya pata chalega, but we had to be as authentic as possible.",0
428,I also learnt how to drive a Jonga (a kind of jeep used by the armed forces).,0
428,"Emotionally, one would have never been able to prepare for the journey I set out on, because once we started shooting, it was relentless.",0
428,"We’ve shot nine scenes a day, and that’s something I have never done before.",0
428,It was a lot of work without a minute to waste or think about anything else.,0
428,"It’s a blessing for an actor, because you just have to be in character all the time, without any distraction.The guilt that Sehmat feels as a wife was the toughest to portray.",0
428,"There were these points in the script where Meghna wrote, ‘Sehmat gives a knowing look’.",1
428,I used to wonder what it means.,0
428,"We used to giggle about it, but when she explained it to me, I realised what she meant.",0
428,"Sehmat is around so many people, and she’s seeing and hearing so many things.",0
428,She cleverly camouflages her true feelings with fake reactions that will go well with the people around her at that point.,0
428,I wondered how I would give ‘that look’.,0
428,"Portraying a spy in the garb of a wife was difficult.It wasn’t a very formal discussion, and when I first met Meghna, 'Raazi' was just an idea.",1
428,I hadn’t read the book back then.,0
428,I have never expressed interest in doing a film on the basis of a single-line narration.,0

428,"It’s like the love you feel for a person, which means the same to everyone all over the world.",0
428,"I wish everyone, all over the subcontinent and the world, watches the trailer and the film, because I think everyone will relate with the core emotion in 'Raazi'.Yeah, I have run risks, but if I don’t do that now, when will I do it?",0
428,I don’t want to live with ‘I could have’ and ‘Maybe I should have’ kind of thoughts.,0
428,I don’t believe in weighing a film’s box office prospects before giving it my nod.,0
428,"If my instinct says that I should do it, I go ahead.",0
428,Like I really wanted to be a part of Sehmat’s world because I’ve never narrated a true story.,0
428,"Of course, we all want to do films that do well, but I also have to live my life truly as an actor and for that, I have to pick different characters.",0
428,"In that sense, I am selfish.I have to surprise or challenge myself with the films I do.",0
428,"I know that it won’t happen every time, but I think I am attracted to that little fear, ‘Will I be able to do this?’ That forms the basis of my hunt for roles.",0
428,"Fortunately, that instinct hasn’t failed me on too many occasions and it feels great that whenever I have taken a risk, it has paid off.I learnt about the sheer selflessness of people and the willingness with which they would give up everything for their nation.",0
428,Look at Sehmat in the trailer.,0
428,"Someone once said to me that there is no such thing as a selfless deed, but I don’t think that is true, especially in this case.",1
428,I don’t think I could have played a more selfless character than Sehmat.,1
428,"A parent putting a child’s interest before his or hers is a great deal, but to put your country’s interest before everything else is even greater.",0
428,"The line in the trailer, ‘Watan ke aage kuch nahi, khud bhi nahi’ encapsulates a sentiment, which is difficult to emulate on screen.It’s an extensive book because it also talks about Sehmat’s parents, Teji and Hidayat, in great detail.",0
428,"So, I just read the portions, which formed the crux of our film.While working on a film, my director becomes my mother, father, boyfriend and friend.",0
428,It wasn’t any different on 'Raazi'.,0
428,Meghna was everything for me and we had an unspoken understanding.,0

428,That’s how we knew he’s liked it.,0

429,"In the film, Omi Vaidya who’s back with his crazy American twang keeps encouraging Dev by saying, “shake it up” (pun intended!).",1
429,"Add to that, there’s a zany song called Sataasat with lyrics alluding to literally shaking it off!",0
429,"Blackmail’s quirky humour and presentation makes it a delight ride.Irrfan gives a solid performance as the average office guy who can’t stand up to his boss, nor to his unfaithful wife.",0
429,He brings an air of helplessness to his character and keeps a straight face even when he’s plotting and planning the blackmail.,1
429,There’s a degree of uncertainty in his actions which comes from his goodness – and that’s what adds to the hilarity of it all.,0
429,"Arunoday Singh, as the wacky track-suit wearing bad boy, is a rage.",0
429,It’s one of the best performances of his career.,0

429,"Characters are bumped off, sometimes in most gory detail and strange events unfold, but the film never loses its vein of easy, black humour.",0
429,This is one of the most wickedly funny films that we’ve seen in a long time.,0

454,"To be fair, over the years, you could always find the odd couple posing for their engagement/wedding photos, looking self-conscious and embarrassed in all their finery amidst the joggers in their track pants and T-shirts.",0
454,But this was something entirely different.,0
454,"As I entered through the Ashoka Gate, the first thing I saw was a heavily-pregnant lady, wearing a maroon empire-line maxi-dress, posing in silhouette against one of the many monuments Lodi Gardens is littered with.",0
454,"Kneeling in front of her was a man who I presumed was her husband, his hand placed proprietorially on her baby bump.",0

454,I smiled indulgently at this tableau and moved on.,0
454,I couldn’t have gone more than thirty paces when yet another photography session caught my eye.,1
454,"This time it was a couple who looked to be in their early 30s, accompanied by a whole team of hair and make-up people, who had opened their little suitcase of products and were conducting urgent repairs on the principals.",0
454,"Once the touch-up was done, one of the photographer’s assistants handed the couple a golden balloon in the shape of the number one.",0
454,"They hoisted it up between them, smiled widely and said ‘cheese’ to celebrate what I can only hope was their first anniversary.",0
454,"Fifty yards on, another love story was being memorialised on camera.",0
454,"This time, it was clearly a proposal, or rather, the re-enacting of one.",0
454,"The boy was in the now-mandatory position of being down on one knee, holding up a ring box in his right hand, while he held out his left arm in what can only be described as a Shah Rukh Khan pose.",0

454,They held this pose for absolute ages as the photographer captured it from every conceivable angle.,0
454,Given how much effort they had put into the ‘proposal’ I was sure that their marriage would be the stuff of legend.,0
454,"And thus it went, photo session after photo session, as I tried my best to meet my target of 10,000 steps.",0
454,And not just that day either; this was pretty much par for the course every single time I went for a walk in Lodi Gardens.,1

454,"Sure, it can’t be cheap.",0
454,"But hey, a good photo will live on forever on Insta; and who knows, if it is striking enough, it may even go viral!",0
454,I guess this was bound to happen one day.,0
454,"A movement that began with everybody taking pictures of their breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the odd fancy meal at an expensive restaurant was bound to end up with heavily-curated pictures of seminal moments of our lives, all subtly highlighted and posted on Insta with a suitable filter (X-pro or Lo-fi, anyone?).",0
454,"After all, if you post innumerable photos showing off the beautiful locations of your summer/winter vacations, then how can you ignore important milestones like proposals, anniversaries, pregnancies, etc.?",0
454,"And surely, such landmark moments rate more than the usual ‘selfies’ (even if they are taken with a selfie-stick).",0
454,"No, you need to call in the professionals at such times.",0
454,"So, I guess that’s why my favourite neighbourhood spot for long, lonely walks has been transformed into Photography Central.",0
454,There are more glittery stilettos in evidence than sturdy running shoes.,0
454,There are more shiny dresses around than there are jogging pants.,0

457,Is a company called ViaHero creating a new model for travel?,0
457,"For a flat fee of $25 a day, travellers can use a service called ViaHero to hire locals on the ground to plan out their trips, arranging everything from lodging and airport pickup to sightseeing and dining.",0
457,"The service combines authentic local recommendations, convenient online booking and the old-school guidance of a travel agent.",1
457,"So far it’s available in Cuba, Iceland, Japan and Colombia, with plans to add Ecuador and other South American countries this year.",0
457,Trips are customised to fit any budget.,0
457,"Travellers can be independent with as much unstructured time as they like, or ViaHero can hire tour guides, drivers and even personal chefs.",0

457,"Buzulencia has loved planning trips since he was a child in Youngstown, Ohio.",0
457,"At age 16, he says, he “begged and pleaded his way” to become an official “TripTik” planner for AAA.",0

457,"Eventually, Buzulencia turned his passion into a 21st- century travel business.",0

457,"For an extra $10 a day, you get additional services like phone support during your trip.",0
457,But why should travellers pay ViaHero $25 a day when travel agents will plan trips for free?,1
457,"“There are plenty of travel agents out there still and a lot of them are doing a great job,” Buzulencia said.",0
457,"“But I think the intimidation factor is, how do I find one?",0
457,"How do I find one that’s good?” Of course, one major reason people use traditional travel agents is that in case of an emergency or change of plans, a travel agent can often seamlessly and at no cost re-book flights and other trip components for you.",0
457,"ViaHero planners will suggest specific flights for your trip and provide links for you to book them, but if you need to change or cancel your flight, you’re on your own when it comes to pleading your case with an airline.",0

474,"What do you expect from a book that claims to document, even if lightly, close to eight decades of breathless filmmaking, in just over 200 pages?",0
474,"Diptakirti Chaudhuri’s Bioscope, just like its quirky cover (a die-cut top layer that part-reveals, part-conceals a priceless poster of the 1958 movie Devta), is an endearing attempt at giving the reader a peek into the show-business that is Bollywood.",0
474,The book debunks conventional linearity in favour of a narrative that takes up themes that have been concurrent nearly at all times in the history of Bollywood.,1
474,"However, the individual chapters deal with these themes chronologically, starting from the 40s or the 50s, and culminating in the present day.",0
474,"From how our favourite songs got made, how the audience’s fashion sense and that of filmstars have informed each other, to how the industry’s most memorable expats were often reduced to stereotypical characters, and how films have identified not only the audience’s pleasure points but its nerve — this book has it all.",0

474,"This helps to achieve readability even with chapters that some readers could find journalistic and more thoughtful than others, like the opening one that discusses box-office collections, or the concluding chapter that succinctly furnishes a sharp, concise history of modern Bollywood, right from the bloody partition that followed our Independence, the Sino-Indian war, constant acts of cross-border terrorism, the 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid, and the orgasmic moment India won the 2011 Cricket World Cup.",0
474,This chapter makes for a beautiful antithesis to the otherwise lighthearted tone of the book.,0
474,That the book is ‘opinionated and emotional’ helps it avoid turning into a bland collection of trivia on a film industry.,1
474,"It is evident that Chaudhuri knows film industries and ways of filmmaking cannot be subjected to the same measuring scale, and this helps him to appreciate the Hindi mainstream industry benevolently, and with greater nuance.",0

481,"The novel, divided into five parts, is told from the point of view of the novel’s younger generation: Devraj’s three daughters – Gargi, Radha and Sita – and the two sons of his right-hand man, Ranjit: Jeet and the illegitimate son, Jivan.",0
481,Devraj’s mad ramblings and reminiscences are interjected randomly throughout the five narratives though they begin to make more sense as the story races towards its predestined ghastly end.,0
481,"The narrative remains faithful to the original play’s twists and turns, and recreates them organically in our ruthless, violent world.",0
481,"But it is the way Taneja imagines these characters (especially the daughters) and makes them familiar and relatable that turns the original on its head, without changing a single detail of the basic story.",0
481,"When a young Gargi Devraj wonders why her father’s friends keep accidentally “brushing her here, or there” (Is it because their arms are “so much longer than women’s they have to”), her sister (who understands they’ve lost the lottery of gender and that her angelic beauty is her currency in this world) laughs and laughs till she cries and tells her “it’s because they can.”

Halfway through Preti Taneja’s book, Gargi Devraj Grover, 33, most obedient daughter and wife, talented, conscientious, childless, successfully shouldering the charade of a marriage she was bartered into at 18, and utterly starved of affection, has her own Time’s Up moment.",0
481,"Tired of collecting dead peacocks her megalomaniac father has been massacring at their farmhouse in another of his famous tantrums, and worried sick about her headstrong youngest sister who has walked out on him, she decides to stop being a bechari and give it back to him.",0
481,"Or as chauvinists would say, she becomes a bitch.",0
481,"Like the play, Taneja’s novel starts with the return of the illegitimate son.",1
481,"Jivan Singh returns to Delhi from America after 15 years to find that the city of his childhood has grown exponentially, with high rises, swanky malls, flyovers and the metro, and that the rich here are above the law.",0
481,That is the side he wants to be on.,0
481,"Quick to unlearn his American way of life, he becomes an amoral agent of fate, a sort of detonator to the discontent and unhappiness in the lives of Devraj’s elder daughters.",0
481,"Preti Taneja (Courtesy the publisher)

The novel is also a critique of contemporary India’s deep-rooted corruption, vast inequalities of wealth, social apathy, misogyny, and communalism.",0
481,"When Devraj begins to go mad (or madder), he does not go it alone.",0
481,"Through his fake anticorruption campaign, he takes the country with him as the narrative moves from Delhi to Amritsar and then to Kashmir.",0
481,"The original may have been written in 1606 and set in an England of an unspecified era, but it fits our times perfectly.",0
481,"Read more: Readers without borders are future of the world, says writer Preti Taneja

Taneja’s writing is fresh and lively and includes a generous bit of Hinglish.",0
481,She takes the reader into the minds of each character – whether it is Jivan secretly grieving for his dead mother or a coked-up Radha trying to keep her grip on what’s happening around her – even as the narrative swirls back and forth from the continuous flow of their thoughts to the action taking place in the world around them.,0
481,"At times, the need to stay true to the source material (and its vicious cruelty and absurdity) makes certain character developments and miscommunications seem forced.Still, because We That Are Young is set so close to home and offers no redemption, it is almost more disturbing than the original.",0

Subroto Bagchi is admired and respected for co-building a one-office, one-country IT startup to an Indian MNC with 43 offices in 17 countries in fewer than 20 years.",0
485,He is an author too and this book is a treasure chest.,0
485,"Bagchi calls himself a “salesperson” and generously recounts personal experiences from across the world, sharing lessons learnt, insights gained, wisdom gleaned from dozens of clients to whom he’s personally sold the services offered by his company.",0
485,He knows his onions since he’s cooked them himself or sometimes been cooked!,0
485,"According to Bagchi selling is also about magic, and he’s met quite a few wizards.",0

485,out their wisdom for readers.,0
485,This book on salespersonship could well have been conceived and delivered as a handbook or perhaps textbook targeted at thousands of students eager to rote-learn sales techniques.,0
485,"Mercifully, the author abandoned such temptation and delivered a work that’s as far away as possible from a “How To” product.",0
485,"Each of the book’s 30 chapters carries a serious moral or, using jargon, sales mantra.",0
485,Bagchi’s crisp narration is compelling.,0

485,My task was to entice tech companies in the Valley to award R&D assignments to us.,0

Or take this valuable insight: In sales you need to focus on three things – physics, chemistry and maths.",0

485,"In this triad, it’s chemistry that’s most important.",0
485,"If that isn’t in place, you won’t succeed.",0
485,"Countless examples abound where wrong chemistry brought about the downfall of good products, great pricing notwithstanding.",0

486,"Or you ignore it because you’re feeling burdened by those same sad realities, and are only looking for entertainment.",0
486,"Or you scoff at it because, look at those terrorists, first they kill people and blow things up, then they whine.",0
486,"If you fall in the third category of reader I described above, you need to understand one thing: it’s people like you who drove the author, fashion professional Nazia Erum, to look at the precious newborn in her arms and give her little girl a name that does not identify her with the religion she was born into.",0

486,It’s about insights.,0

486,"What were the challenges that were exclusively hers?”

This question led Erum to interview 145 Muslim middle class families across 12 cities over a year.",0
486,Much emerged about Islamophobia in schools and colleges.,0
486,"But almost as much emerged about prejudices against almost all other minorities, prejudices within the Muslim community itself, the impact of ‘Islamic terror’ on ordinary Muslims, and the age-old tension between traditional community ideals and personal values.",0
486,"All in all, I found more to think about in this very slim book than I have in any other of this nature.",0
486,"Watch: Disturbing stories inside elite schools of Delhi

For instance, there’s the question of blame.",0
486,"As one mother pointed out to Erum in an interview, how do you tell your child that her tormentor at school is just a child?",0
486,‘Just a child’ implies that a child cannot really understand the things she says and does.,0
486,"Yet, the child at the receiving end knows exactly what’s going on.",0
486,"Of the 118 Muslim families with children aged between five and 20 that Erum interviewed in Delhi/NCR, 100 said they’d been called ‘terrorist’ and/or ‘Pakistani’.",0
486,Many were bewildered and hurt.,0
486,Others shrugged and said this was the Muslim equivalent of Sardar jokes.,0
486,Yet others pointed out how Dalits and other sections of Indian society face worse.,0
486,"But when 85 per cent of 118 children from one community have been called terrorists or enemies of the state, it’s time to figure out what is going on, how, why, and what could be done about it.",0
486,"The schools these children go to or went to are all recognisable as ‘good’, and are apparently progressive in ideals and attitude.",0
486,But Erum’s interviews showed something most people don’t think about.,0
486,"As entities, the schools may have cosmopolitan values, but the teachers they hire may not.",0
486,And schools do not often react in a positive manner – or any manner – to complaints of religion-based bullying.,0
486,Which is why many children and parents don’t complain at all.,0
486,"Author Nazia Erum (Courtesy Juggernaut)

But, in fact, as Erum discovered in Bhopal, religious discrimination can run deeper in the education system than anyone believed.",0

486,"But in Bhopal, students who take Urdu (mostly Muslim) are all in one section, and students who take Sanskrit (mostly Hindu) are all together in another.",0

THE ORIGIN

Drag as a term was reportedly first used in 1870 with some claiming that it was an acronym of ‘Dressed Resembling A Girl’.",0
499,But this claim remains disputed as there is no concrete evidence that acronyms were ever in use in the 19th century.,0
499,"Yet, the word stuck and has now found its way into the Indian queer space of entertainment with an underlying message of non-conformity, trampling over the definitions of being a man, woman or the other.",0
499,"“Through drag I get to show that the pronouns ‘he’, ‘she’ or ‘other’ are often irrelevant,” points out Kush.",0
499,"Just about every Indian drag artiste has a strong Western influence by way of RuPaul or an Alaska Thunder F**k, both hugely popular American drag performers.",0
499,"Any Indian influence is limited to language, music and names, but not from cross-dressers in the traditional theatre forms that are still alive in many parts of the country.",0
499,“The context is different.,0
499,"The Indian example is a form of patriarchy that denied women the stage,” says the former Mr Gay India and drag artiste, Sushant Digwikar aka Rani Ko-He-Nur.",0
499,"Possibly this is why the celebrated actor from West Bengal, Janardan Nandi (whose surname is replaced with the word Rani), known for playing the role of a woman for almost all of his 75 years in theatre, uses the word ‘impersonation’ rather than drag.",0
499,Not every drag queen picked this art form as some kind of choice or realisation of the self.,1
499,Sushant’s connection with drag was incidental as he cross-dressed as a co-host for the Kashish Film Festival in 2015.,0
499,"One thing led to another and he was soon given the drag name Rani Ko-He-Nur by Keshav Suri, who is credited with the rise of drag performances in India, given the way he has promoted them at his night clubs in Delhi and Bangalore, Kitty Su and Kitty Ko.",0
499,"This has suddenly led to a variety of events – such as the Red Festival, Queer- E- Mehfil and the Bangalore Queer Film Festival – throwing in a drag show or two.",0

499,Sushant aims to take drag to the national stage probably using media such as TV as a tool.,0
499,Alex believes that there can be one drag queen for each state of India.,0

Asked why he took up the ukulele, fellow player Jonty Bankes said, “Basically, it’s cheap and rather easy to play, so for people like us it was a godsend.” But the self-styled orchestra has noticed a power in the tiny instrument over the years -- with gigs including two nights at Carnegie Hall, a set at the Glastonbury Festival in England and a private party at Windsor Castle for Queen Elizabeth II’s 90th birthday.",0
500,"“The thing is, when you bring a ukulele out and start playing it, it does actually make people smile,” Bankes said.",1

509,"She estimates her team will work on 20 custom tiaras this year, which, in this rarefied air, counts as a huge uptick.",0
509,"Under Scott’s direction, Garrard has introduced a large collection of ready-to-wear tiaras, too.",0
509,"Part of the reason, Scott says, is that tiaras are unfailingly flattering.",0
509,These mini-crowns tend to lengthen necks and straighten backs — the sheer weight of one will make even the slouchiest stand taller.,0

532,"“Once you see the pristine beauty of the Himalayan ranges and awe-inspiring peaks set against the blue sky, you cannot escape from its magic grip.",1
532,"However, tourists and pilgrims who go there are often not aware of the hostile weather conditions, the tough mode of travel, the distance between various towns and villages, refuelling points, boarding and lodging facilities, hospitals and other essential facilities,” says Babu.",0
532,"At the same time, Babu speaks about the legends, history and myths of the Himalayas.",0

533,"My guide in London, Marguerite Ryder-Large, a Blue Badge tourist guide, expertly steered me through the busiest streets, and ‘crowded to the brim’ London tube stations: weaving in and out, her large frame leading with confidence and authority, while I followed, juggling with two bags, a heavy camera and an umbrella.",1
533,The city is simply overwhelming even if you are visiting for the nth time.,0
533,"Though I have seen most of the touristy places during my last trip, I was awestruck by the city’s magnificence.",0
533,"In London, every corner has some relevance to history, literature or something that I can always relate to.",1
533,It just feels like connecting the dots… every place brings back memories of a novel or a book that I read fondly or a film that I watched and remembered dearly…most of the places give me a déja vu feeling.,0

533,"The smartly dressed guard Attila Bodis is from Slovakia and he was so happy when I told him that I visited his country and liked Bratislava, where he hails from.",0
533,"He spoke fondly about his hometown, and immediately sent me a friend request on Facebook: now we are FB friends!",0
533,"We went past St. Mary-Le-Strand where Dickens’s parents were married and then headed to 26, Wellington Street – Dickens’s last address in London that housed the offices of Dickens’s Magazine “All the Year Round” and his private apartments from 1859 to 1870 as the blue plaque on the wall says.",0
533,I was most curious to see Covent Garden Piazza - the notorious Bermondsey slum featured in Oliver Twist.,0
533,"It was here that Dickens worked as a child labourer and looked longingly at the fresh pineapples in the marketplace; years later he had his offices here; then we saw the Bow Street police station, where the ‘Artful Dodger’ was brought after being caught by the Coppers in Oliver Twist.",0
533,"In 1879, the court moved across the road to its current location, opposite the Royal Opera House (Dickens often visited this place).",0

533,"Now it is a museum, but more about it later.",0
533,"The British Museum is dedicated to human history, art and culture.",0
533,"Its permanent collection, numbering some eight million works, is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence and originates from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.",0
533,Almost the whole world is featured here and Marguerite knows the museum like the back of her hand!,0
533,"She said, “Many people don’t know that in London 20 museums are free, open every day of the week- people can make use of these free entries and benefit.”

I thought it’s a valid point.",0
533,The museum is like a large ocean packed with information and our Indian gallery is with precious Indian artefacts.,0
533,"Then we called it a day and came back to my hotel, which is close by in Harrington Gardens, Kensington: tired with processing so much information in my small head, that night I went to sleep, thinking of Dickens.",0

539,"He adds, “Some villages we shot in were submerged due to Polavaram project.",0
539,"So, if one has to see the green cover of their villages, they should watch Rangasthalam.” Working on a film of this magnitude is not an easy job and at times, some differences may crop up between technicians.",0
539,Ask Ramakrishna if there was an instance which required him to convince or persuade Sukumar?,0
539,"He explains, “There is no room for arguments or differences whatsoever.",0
539,We had a plan and our only job is to make sure our director’s conviction comes true.,0
539,Everything went on really smooth.,0

547,"Lothal is akin to a once valuable clock, a childhood artifact, gathering dust in the attic stuck in a time reminiscent of happy memories and unfulfilled dreams.",0
547,"It has been nearly 4,000 years since boats sailed upstream from the Gulf of Khambat on the River Sabarmati and its tributary Bhogavo to Lothal in search for etched carnelian beads, seals and sealings, shell, ivory, copper and bronze objects that were in high demand in Western Asia.",0
547,"The boats took advantage of the high tide to reach this important trading town, unloaded their goods on a wharf adjacent to the dockyard, reloaded the goods earmarked for export and rode the waning tide to the Arabian Sea.",0

547,Decaying foundations are sole remnants of splendid structures that stood here aptly signifying the futility of human endeavours.,1

547,But what do we know about the humans that inhabited this town?,0
547,"What were their aspirations, their festivals, their joys and fears?",0
547,"When we come across the ornaments worn by women of Lothal or a terracotta bull and horse that might have been prized possessions of a child, we are overwhelmed by a strange tinge of sadness.",0
547,"When we behold a couple of vases painted with the story of a wise crow who dropped pebbles into a pitcher to drink water or a cunning fox who fooled a couple of birds holding a fish in their beaks to sing, we instantly appreciate the timelessness of these stories.",0
547,"And when we stumble upon terracotta gamesmen resembling the pieces on a chessboard, we realise that even though we shall all perish eventually, some of our memories will survive even the indifferent march of time.",0

548,It was the desire to let the public know more about Chitaral led her to work on it.,1
548,"Winding up, she says, “There are many who don’t even know about the significance of the place, While Jainism and Buddhism is mostly associated with China and other Asian countries, the site became under the jurisdiction of the ASI.",0

The Japanese have a huge respect for India.",0
549,"“Since most Japanese are Buddhists, they revere India as the land of Lord Buddha,” he says.",1
549,"“They know about Mahatma Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose.”

The youngsters have a different attitude.",0
549,"“They feel India is growing so fast, at 7 per cent, compared to Japan’s 2 per cent, so they are thinking about how they can invest in India, and make money,” says Tiby.",0
549,But some misconceptions do exist.,0
549,"Since there are many North Indian restaurants in Tokyo, they feel that all Indians eat naan every day.",0
549,"“For them the curry we have is either vegetable or chicken,” says Tiby.",0
549,“They are surprised to know that we eat with our hand.,0
549,"After watching movies, they feel that there are a lot of animals on the streets.”

Tiby, who is originally from Kothamangalam, has been living in Japan for the past 19 years.",0
549,"He is the CEO of a company called Pinmicro, which provides indoor GPS platforms.",0
549,"His partners are two Malayalees, Jayaraj T G and Gijo Sivan.",0
549,"They provide digital solutions to improve efficiency in the workplace, be it offices, factories, warehouses or hospitals.",0
549,He gives an example.,0
549,"“In a confectionery factory, the management wanted to ensure that every employee who enters the factory should have an air shower (this is usually done at entrances to remove particles on the clothes), followed by a hand-wash with alcohol to get rid of germs,” says Tiby.",0
549,The company had placed cameras all over the factory.,0
549,But then they realised that nobody can look at the cameras all the time.,0
549,"But through Tiby’s GPS platform, if a person forgets to do a hand wash, an alert is immediately initiated.",0
549,"“Hence, he or she cannot enter the factory premises,” says Tiby.",0
549,"“This will ensure employees who enter the work place are always clean.”Asked whether this constituted an invasion of privacy, Tiby says, “We are not recording anything.”

Meanwhile, when asked the advantages of working in Japan, Tiby says, “The technology is at an advanced stage.",0
549,The transportation is very efficient.,0
549,It is a clean and safe country.”And the people have a social attitude.,0
549,"During the devastating earthquake which hit Tokyo in 2011, there was a water shortage.",0
549,The government instructed that everybody would receive two bottles of drinking water every day.,0
549,"“They would only take the amount specified by the government and not more,” he says.",0
549,"“When there were widespread power shutdowns, there were no reports on any thefts in the numerous shopping areas, which would have happened in other countries.",0
549,"The Japanese are a very self-disciplined people.”

But there are negatives too.",0
549,"“It is difficult to work in Japan since people only speak Japanese,” says Tiby.",1
549,"“It took me a few years to learn the language.”

The business model is still the old industrial style.",0
549,"“So everybody follows what the boss says,” says Tiby.",0
549,“But that time is over.,0
549,"You have to work fast, make decisions quickly, and be innovative.”

And Tiby can notice the ‘falling behind’ effect when he goes to the malls.",0
549,"Ten years ago, when he went to buy a mobile phone, there were Japanese products from Sharp, Casio and Fujitsu.",1
549,"“Now, it is only Samsung and Apple, and a few Japanese brands,” he says.",0
549,"“Many American, Korean and Chinese companies have gone past the Japanese.”

Another problem for the Japanese is the declining birth rates.",0
549,"“The number of children per couple in Japan is very low,” says Tiby.",0
549,“A small work force will have to feed a lot of elderly people.,0
549,This will become critical in the next five years.,0
549,"So, the government is doing a lot to attract Indian talent to Japan.",0
549,"There are a lot of Indo-Japanese events taking place in India as well as Japan.”

However, Tiby says that even though they live in Japan, the Malayalis are preserving their culture.",0
549,"“For Onam, last year, 500 people gathered and we had sadya and other celebrations,” says Tiby who is married to Nigi and has two children, son, Johaan, nine-and-a-half and daughter Jewel, 7.",0
549,"Asked his future plans, Tiby says, “I plan to work for the next ten years in Japan till my children reach university.",0
549,Then I will return to Kerala and help young people who have plans to set up start-ups.”,0

552,HYDERABAD: Holland greeted me with a stormy weather but compensated with hot chocolate (with lots of cream on the top!!),1
552,and stroopwafels.,0
552,"Well, both the weather and the irresistible food are typically Dutch.",0
552,"While in Holland, one has to take the weather with a handful of salt and grab the goodies with both the hands.",1
552,"In a scenic drive of fewer than 30 minutes from the Amsterdam airport, we reached a beautiful Country Estate – ‘Landgoed Duin & Kruidberg’ (try pronouncing it!).",0
552,"This lovely property ensconced in the woods has turned from the once princely hunting grounds to five- star hotel, restaurant and convention centre all rolled into one: it has an interesting history and many exciting tales to tell.",0
552,The fairy tale Old-Dutch style monument takes one back to the 17th century when many Amsterdam traders boasted rural estates like this.,0
552,Its oldest known owner Hendrik Reijnst was with Dutch East India Company.,0
552,The estate changed many landlords from governors to ministers to politicians; it became a hunting lodge; underwent changes from baroque to typically British.,0
552,What impressed me most was its priceless art filling every corner.,0
552,Its four beautiful period rooms were my favourite haunts as I would walk through them or recline in a seat and sink in the old world charm.,0
552,My room had a pretty view of the pond where ducks were swimming the whole day.,0
552,"On the way to the Brasserie in the basement, I would often stop at the statue of Moses and give him an admiring look, silently appreciating the sculptor.",0
552,My introduction to Dutch cuisine happened rather interestingly.,0
552,"In their Michelin starred restaurant De Vrienden van Jacob, the chef sent me a starter that tasted like our much loved “masala vada”, one of the many gems from the South Indian “evening tiffin” repertoire.",0
552,"When I enquired after its history, the young, enthusiastic waiter went to the chef and came back with the recipe: it is made of buckwheat and powdered macadamia nuts, deep-fried to a golden brown.",0
552,"Then came a “sago papad” like fritter, which reminded me of home, of the heavenly rasam, hot rice, melted ghee and potato chips: the waiter went to and fro again to get me the info – it is made of the stuff used for the outer cover of spring roll.",0
552,"That’s all, I didn’t bother him anymore, though he looked at me questioningly after serving each course – I relaxed and enjoyed my first Dutch meal that ended with the most delicious and sinful chocolate-caramelised banana combo with peanut butter.",0
552,I threw caution to the squally winds outside and indulged without an iota of guilt.,0
552,"That afternoon, as a storm raged with the gustiest winds, we set out to visit Zaanse Schans (another tongue twister?",0
552,"), which is a unique mill village that brings together many important elements of Dutch heritage from the Zaan district.",0
552,Numerous mills and historic houses have been collected here and restored to their former glory.,0
552,"Along with the Old Dutch crafts like clog making, cheese making, and pewter casting, it provides a good impression of Netherlands’ rich history.",1
552,We had a memorable tour of this place: more memorable because of the weather.,0
552,"Fighting against a cruel gale, holding my upturned umbrella with all my might, I saved myself from being blown away by the strong winds!",0
552,"As we strolled past, clutching the flying umbrellas of course, the 18th and 19th centuries were brought to life and the smell of fresh bread wafted across.",0
552,Entering the 17th-century cheese farm “Catharina Hoeve” was like stepping back in time.,0
552,"Dressed in the traditional Dutch costume, a charming lady demonstrated how the world famous “Gouda” cheese is produced in accordance with a very Old Dutch recipe.",1
552,We tasted different types of cheese after gaining considerable knowledge on the subject of Dutch cheese.,1
552,The farm shop was set in a charming ambience – I bought lots of cheese and some souvenirs to take back home.,0
552,The De Vrede warehouse from the 18th century now houses a clog maker’s shop and clog museum.,0
552,"In a fun-filled demonstration, the handsome young man with a winning smile showed old clog making craft that magically transformed a plain block of wood into a lovely wooden shoe.",0
552,"The accompanying clog museum houses the finest collection of antique clogs in the Netherlands, accumulated over the years, including many unusual specimens, like authentic carved bride clogs, work clogs, and the famous Hindelooper church clogs from 1675.",0
552,"To take back home, I bought many pairs of tiny and very pretty clogs made of porcelain and wood: quite different from the usual fridge magnets which either end up fighting for space on an overcrowded fridge door or sit wrapped and unnoticed in the kitchen shelves.",0
552,"In this Dutch location, there were several working windmills producing paint, oil, wood and mustard, attractive little shopping streets lined with authentic, green painted wooden houses.",0
552,This is certainly Holland at its best!!,0

560,"The travails of fund-raising and gathering expertise for the restoration of this storied courtyard are recorded in a beautiful, scholarly book published by the KVPT as documentation for future restoration efforts—but for those who are not necessarily engrossed in the essentials of architectural history and are just enamoured by magnificent edifices, an unparalled use of space and light, a window into an exemplary of Newar architecture, the artistic traditions encapsulated within it, and a unique, innovative example of converting a palace into a museum, the beautiful courtyard is waiting to be visited.",0

560,"The Sundari Chowk is now available for big, ambitious exhibitions that the previously dark palace interiors could not have housed, in keeping with its analogue in the galleries of the Patan Museum which hold an open-air staircase that is bracketed by the glorious struts of the Bhai Degah Temple that may never have been seen at eye level in an older, lower ceilinged gallery structure.",0

577,There are many unique ingredients one comes across during one’s culinary pursuits.,0
577,"The ones that have simply awed me for their distinct character, aesthetic beauty and flavour are fiddle head ferns and morels.",1
577,I came across both in my hometown Uttaranchal.,0
577,"Mushrooms being one of my favourites, I would definitely think of morels as one my most favourite ingredients.",1
577,Morels are edible sac fungi or simply put ‘mushrooms’ - the beauty is that they can’t be cultivated.,1
577,"They are hand picked and harvested, the complex symbiotic relationship these wonderful fungi have with trees cannot be replicated in an artificial environment.",0
577,"The flavour is earthy, nutty, meaty and intense but never over powering.",0
577,"They truly satisfy every quality one looks for - olfactory, visual, taste and texture.",0
577,Like the saying goes ‘morels are everywhere and impossible to find’.,0
577,I have never had a chance to forage for them but was gifted a few hundred grams by a close friend and a few hundred grams of fresh morels are a treasure not to be taken lightly.,0
577,"I love them sauteed in butter and seasoned with sea salt and if I really feel adventurous, then have them with soft gooey eggs as an accompaniment.",0
577,"I have never been able to serve them at our restaurant (except on our Christmas menu which was well received), because of the difficulty in procuring them.",0
577,I would like to actually go to the mountains and forage for them myself one day - that would be a fantastic culinary adventure.,1
577,The positive feedbacks helped too.,0
577,Now I’m a director and chef at Forage.,0
577,The food we offer here is also quite different from the others in the city.,0
577,"My partners, Mayura and Rajnish, are all runners and swimmers.",0
577,We brought a change in our lifestyle when we took interest in the sport.,0
577,"When I got into competitive running, I changed my outlook towards the way I look and maintain myself.",0
577,"I stopped having dairy products, processed food and anything that had preservatives.",0
577,"This was something I did for myself, but when Mayura, Rajnish and I realised that this might be something others like us will also be interested in, we decided to open Forage.",0

580,"Firstly, this doesn’t necessarily mean the chocolate is old, or inedible.",1
580,This white ‘thing’ on the chocolate does not mean that the chocolate is mouldy.,1

580,There are two kinds of chocolate bloom: fat bloom and sugar bloom.,1
580,Sugar bloom occurs when moisture comes in contact with the chocolate.,0
580,The chocolate that you eat typically contains sugar.,0
580,Fat bloom is more complicated and may be caused by a combination of factors.,0
580,"These include improper storage conditions, changes in temperature, or poor tempering.",0
580,"In fact, this strange phenomenon, known as “fat bloom”, is all down to how we store our favourite chocolatey treats.",0
580,It happens to be the biggest cause of customer complaints and costs the chocolate industry millions of pounds every year.,1
580,"So, what can you do to prevent it?",0
580,"To properly store your chocolate, an ideal situation is to keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place, such as a cellar or pantry.",0
580,"If you live in a hot, humid area and you don’t happen to have air-conditioning at your place, store it in the coolest place in the house, typically a lower cupboard or a dark pantry.",0
580,You can carefully wrap and seal your chocolates in a couple of layers of plastic wrap or ziplock bags to keep moisture and odors out.,0
580,"Lastly, you can also seal the bags in an airtight container, and then place it in the warmest spot in your refrigerator, often the top and middle shelves, toward the front.",0

587,"Our personal favourite from the night was the Medium Hot Mushroom bowl - assorted mushrooms, chilli reduction, spring onion, udon noodles and dry red chillies.",0
587,"We couldn’t put our forks down, as the different textures of the various mushrooms paired with the udon noodles, took us back to a rainy night where you’re sitting in front of the TV with your loved ones and have ordered Chinese takeout from that place you love around the corner.",0

588,Working on two different cheese farms in Canada helped hone my skills.,1
588,"I learnt so much about farming and about raising animals at these cheese farms, skills that are rare to acquire in India,” he says.",0
588,What drew him towards cheese was the process of making it.,0
588,"He says that he was ‘fascinated’ by how milk could be kept away for months, after which it gives you something so different and unique.",0

588,"Now, each time I visit California, I make it a point to go there.”

While he says that cheese made in Himalayas is good, he says that India is not suited for making the Western style of cheeses.",0
588,“Making cheese requires a cool environment for fermentation to happen.,1
588,The ideal temperature inside a cheese cellar is 10-12 degrees.,1
588,"While the cheese you get in Kodaikanal, which is quite popular, isn’t bad, there is nothing cutting edge about it.",0
588,"One can still find some good cheese being used in the northeast, as yak milk imparts a nice flavour to the product.”

Aditya says that he has no plans on starting his own cheese farm, and wants to continue being a cheese consultant.",0
588,"Talking about what this entails, he says, “As a consultant, I go to farms that are engaged in selling dairy products such as milk and ghee, and are looking to add value to their products.",0
588,"I take them through the entire process of cheese making — from how to set up a cheese cellar, how fermentation and aging work to the actual business part of it where they have to sell their products.”

In India, Aditya says, consumers are not very knowledgeable about cheese yet, but this is changing.",0
588,"“The most popular kinds of cheeses here remain gouda and cheddar, and fresh cheese such as mozzarella and feta.",0
588,"However, people are slowly starting to open up to various other kinds of cheeses now.”

589,These products can be soaked in warm water for 30 minutes to rehydrate and put to use for making various dishes.,0

592,So I decided to pursue my passion as my career and in 2003 I was appointed as a South Indian chef at a popular hotel.,0
592,"I have worked in a couple of places including Malaysia, Hyderabad and Chennai.",0
592,There are are lot of cuisines in South India and I cook them all.,0
592,"But, my specialities are Chettinad and Andhra cuisine.",0
592,"Although they might seem similar, there are a lot of differences between them — be it in terms of the ingredients used or the flavours.",0
592,Both these cuisines are spicy and make use of lot of dry spices.,0
592,But the way they are used to give flavour to the dish is entirely different.,0
592,"For instance in Chettinad cuisine, traditional spices like black stone flower, peppercorns, are used, whereas in Andhra cuisine hot spices like Guntur chilli, garlic, are used.",1
592,"Another difference is that in Andhra cuisine, we use a lot of salt and there are many varieties of pickles and chutneys.",0
592,Most of the Southern cuisines follow a similar cooking method.,0
592,The difference comes in the intensity of the spices used or the substitutes each one uses to give a different flavour.,1
592,"For instance, in Kerala cuisine, we primarily use coconut oil as the base, whereas in Chettinad it is mostly gingelly oil and in Andhra cuisine we use refined oil only.",0
592,Rice is a staple food in all the Southern States is something we all know.,0
592,"However, the kind of rice that is used differs in each State — for Chettinad cuisine we use jeeraga samba rice, for Andhra cuisine we use ponni raw rice.",0
592,Event the meat used differs in each State.,0
592,So these little elements define South Indian cuisine.,0
592,During my stay in Malaysia I realised that most people there prefer our cuisine and they love our spices a lot.,1
592,So it was indeed a pleasure to cook for them.,0
592,In Malaysian cuisine they don’t use rich spices like we do.,0
592,They use a lot of lemon grass.,0
592,So our dishes seemed something new.,0
592,I was particular not to tamper with the authenticity of my dishes.,0
592,I don’t like to play around with the flavours.,0
592,"I want to learn and specialise in Arabic cuisine, as that’s also rich in spices.",0

612,Food tech start-ups across the country—from the big-ticket ones to the mid-sized and small ventures—are walking on a cloud to stay in business and beat the competition.,0
612,"Take Cloud kitchen, a new online restaurant genre without brick and mortar.",0
612,"Unlike a traditional restaurant that offers dine-in or takeaway facility, it only delivers food.",0
612,"The dish of choice is just a click or a swipe away, quite literally, as orders are placed via websites or apps and in some cases with phonecalls.",0
612,"These cloud kitchens either have an online medium to take the orders or accept requests via food delivery start-ups such as Zomato, Swiggy, etc.",1

612,"He says, “Cloud kitchen only provides delivery service, so the focus remains on food, its preparation, quality and packaging.",1
612,Technology plays a major role.,0
612,"This revenue model is gaining a foothold as it cuts costs, time, and works well for both the owner and customer.”

It has been noted that the number of dine-in customers has decreased significantly over the last few years, with customers mostly opting for home delivery.",0
612,Many are now shutting down outlets or moving towards cloud kitchens to cut down on the cost and maximise returns.,1
612,"Stiff competition in the restaurant industry, along with reducing margins, made restaurateur Ashish Parashar of Mumbai-based Litti Express partially move to cloud kitchen.",0
612,"He opened Litti Express, his first restaurant serving authentic food from North India in Oshiwara, Mumbai, but slowly moved

to the cloud model when he decided to start operations in Bandra.",0
612,"“After running my outlet for a couple of years, I realised that the restaurant space is highly competitive.",0
612,The high rentals in a city like Mumbai coupled with the rising cost of infrastructure and manpower management only add to our woes.,0
612,"Cloud kitchen seems like the smarter way to run my business,” says Parashar.",0
612,"Cloud kitchen restaurants try to maximise the number of orders per day, by decreasing the production and packaging time, and managing the logistics.",1
612,"With menu options galore in cloud kitchens, there is always one to suit every palate.",0
612,"As Bela Gupta of Herbivore says, “The younger generation doesn’t want dal chawal every day.",0
612,They earn well but sadly don’t have the time and energy to cook an elaborate spread.,0

612,"We have a

15-member team to handle a variety of dishes from a wide vegetarian menu, comprising global and regional cuisines.",0

One of the pioneers is Faasos—available across 140 locations in 13 cities—and has been operating profitably for years.",0

612,"We will continue to have a centralised model that allows us to go to market quickly, maintain quality standards and to operate costs while continuously pushing the bar on the service element,” says Mohit Mital of Chefkraft.",0
612,"However, the cloud kitchen model is not a sure shot recipe for success in the food tech business, since there are potential pitfalls too.",0
612,"The founders of Delhi-based cloud kitchen player Yumist that shut its operations in September 2017 said in its company blog, “Cloud kitchens are here to stay.",1

612,"The problem we were trying to solve is a big one, and we are certain someone will pick up from where we left.",0

614,As we started our conversation with Uttam Tripathy of Potli—an Indian restaurant in London—we were reminded of the film Cheeni Kum.,0
614,"Remember, how the movie starts off with the fiercely proud owner of an Indian restaurant, Amitabh Bachchan, boasting of his knowledge about Hyderabadi Zafrani Pulao?",0
614,Uttam’s passion for serving authentic and impeccably-cooked Indian dishes to the westerners called for the comparison.,1
614,"In fact, The Week voted it as one of the 24 best Indian restaurants in London in 2017.",1
614,The 40-year-old native of Odisha’s Sambalpur district is on a mission to popularise Indian market cuisine in the West.,0
614,"Until 1995, Uttam had no clue about the hotel or food industry.",0
614,It was luck by chance that he cleared his interview for an integrated course in Hotel Management at Kolkata’s Taratala to become a part of the Indian Institute of Hotel Management.,0
614,"As he puts it himself, ‘out of nowhere’ he was selected for the institute’s Chennai campus.",0
614,"And, that’s how he set on a voyage of good food.",0
614,“No one had ever opted for hotel management in my family of engineers and professors.,0
614,"But, I have enjoyed being with people,” he says.",0
614,"The restaurant and the staff members

Setting up Potli wasn’t an overnight affair.",0
614,He faced a fair share of struggle before striking the right note.,0
614,"With memories of Sambalpur etched in his mind, he left for Delhi to realise his dreams.",0
614,His associations with some of the reputed hotels in the national capital helped him learn the tricks of the trade.,0
614,"However, his insatiable hunger for entrepreneurship took him to London in 2004.",0
614,"“I faced a tough time for more than a year, when I first came to London.",0
614,People who brought me to the city didn’t keep their words.,0
614,"Soon, I had no job,” Uttam recollects.",0
614,"Fortunately, he bumped into a client, who hired him for launching a bar-cum-Indian restaurant in north-west London.",0
614,"He transformed a dying old English pub into a swanky yet traditional Indian bar, Blue Ginger.",0
614,“I wasn’t happy deep inside working for others.,0
614,"With nothing in hand, I quit my job in 2010.",0
614,Along with a friend I was knocking on the doors of investors and banks to secure investment for my project.,0
614,Everyone rejected us.,0
614,"Finally, I met a bank manager, who approved the loan,” he shared.It took another six to seven months for the duo to refurbish the place and finally Potli was launched on August 15, 2011.",0
614,He never looked back since.,0
614,The restaurant was rated one of the top Indian restaurants in London by Tatler in 2013.,0
614,Potli’s dal makhani was named as one of the top 5 Indian dishes by Hardens.,0
614,"It hosted several celebrities, including Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in 2011.",0
614,"At Potli, Uttam had tried to popularise the commercial Indian dishes, sold at marketplaces.",0
614,"The concept was inspired by the famed biryani brand of Hyderabad, Paradise; Tunde Kababi of Lucknow; Alkauser of Delhi and of course, the quintessential Indian dhabas.",0
614,"But, what motivated Uttam to start an Indian restaurant to tickle the taste buds of Britons?",0
614,The entrepreneur with a typical Indian facial morphology took a deep breath before he answered that.,0
614,"Much to his surprise, he says that he discovered that the Indian restaurants in London weren’t selling genuine dishes.",1
614,"They had, as he claims, either Anglicised or transformed the dishes into something very hot and spicy to give Europeans a ‘high’ after a few shots of tequila on a Saturday date night.",0
614,“Indian food was considered to be the cheapest in the country.,0
614,"The pocket-friendly chicken Madras, balti chicken, chicken tikka masala and vindaloo defined Indian cuisine, thanks to the curry houses here.",1
614,"But, none of these were truly Indian,” he adds.",0
614,"For instance, the vindaloo, which is primarily a tangy Goan pork delicacy, was being cooked with chicken, prawns or lamb.",0
614,The word vindaloo originated from vinegar and garlic.,0
614,"However, the curry houses there had apparently turned it into the hottest dish, served with unidimensional heat of red chili powder.",0
614,"It wasn’t a challenge for Uttam to introduce the cuisine in London, home to over 10,000 Indian restaurants.",1
614,The real challenge was to bust the myth surrounding it.,0
614,"In fact, Uttam has come a long way from when an English couple left Potli for not finding balti chicken in its menu to serving pani puri, vegetable chops, shammi kebab and a lot more Indian stuff to the westerners.",0
614,"And much like Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge’s Amrish Puri, Uttam sticks to his Indian side.",0
614,"“I was inspired by the way my grandmother would cook for 40 to 50 people alone,” he chuckles.",0

615,One unique thing about vegetarian and vegan vacations is the sustainability and responsible living while enjoying vegan foods served in some hotels exclusively for such tourists.,1
615,“There’s definitely been an increase in the demand for vegan travel.,0
615,"More people around the world are warming up to vegan ideas, concepts and benefits who were previously put off by the mere mention of the word ‘vegan’, much less considering it as a full-time or part-time diet in their daily life,"" said VegVoyages co-founder, Zac Lovas.",0
615,"""This directly fuels vegan travel whether it’s more vegans searching for vegan travel options or more non-vegans not fearing to be on a tour with vegans and eating vegan meals for one or two weeks at a time,” Lovas added.",1
615,Lovas stated that food is one of the biggest incentives for travellers to start a vegan tour.,0
615,"“People don’t want to go to a country and be able to only eat side dishes and salads, or be stuck eating the same thing that they eat back home.",0
615,One of the benefits of travelling on a vegan trip is to be able to enjoy eating what the locals eat and not having to worry about whether or not it’s 100% vegan.,0
615,"You can still get a glimpse into the local culture and history through the community’s cuisine on a vegan adventure,” he explained.",0
615,"Popular destinations for vegan tourists include- India, Bali and Sumatra in Indonesia and Laos.",1
615,The age range of tourists varies from 18 to 80 years and include both single and couples from all walks of life.,0
615,"Owing to the increasing demand, Lovas's travel firm has increased its group size from just eight people to 18.",0
615,"According to Lovas, during the first seven years of running the company, most people identified themselves as ‘vegetarian’.",0
615,"But, many others consider themselves as vegan nowadays.",0
615,"Approximately 75 percent of the tourists are vegan, while 25 percent are non-vegan, the latter typically comprising of friends or spouses of vegans, or those who are health-conscious.",0
615,The company’s repeat customer base is between 70 to 80 percent respectively.,0
615,"Tour operator Tierno Tours in Concord, North Carolina, has also seen a rise in demand for vegan travel.",0
615,"In 2010, it ran the first of its annual Vegano Italiano trips to Italy.",0
615,These trips became so popular that the company launched Vegan Travel Club soon.,0
615,"In 2016, in collaboration with veteran eco-vegan travel agency Green Earth Travel, the company added new destinations to its 2017 calendar.",0
615,"The new destinations included Peru, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.",0
615,"The tours feature a range of activities, such as celebrity vegan speakers, plant-based cooking demonstrations, and visits to wineries and heritage sites.",0
615,“Because we have a lot of repeat business we try to develop different tours every year.,0
615,"Some, like Italy and Ireland, we continue to do every year, and others, like San Francisco or Peru, are a one-time deal.",0
615,Some of our choices are based on prices and some places become more favourable because airfares go down or money exchanges are to our advantage.,0
615,"Locations also come in and out of favour,” said Vegan Travel Club co-founder Gretchen Sheridan.",1
615,"""Right now, Ireland and Scotland have become very popular due to a lot of movies and hit TV shows being filmed there.",0
615,"Berlin, Rome and Barcelona are also big attractions because of the sheer number of vegan eateries there,” Sheridan added.",0
615,"Donna Zeigfinger, the owner of Green Earth Travel celebrated its 20th-anniversary last year.",0
615,"Having experience in working in the travel industry for the last 30 years, she said that people have been enquiring on vegan vacations and adventure trips, along with a large demand for vegan festivals, culinary tours and health conference tours on cruises.",0
615,Vegan vacations are not only confined to land-based tours.,0
615,A first plant-based cruise was recently announced by Australia.,0
615,"In 2017, the world’s first all-vegan cruise took place from London to Norway, carrying 1,881 guests from 34 countries.",0
615,"This was organized by German company Vegan Travel, which specialises in river and ocean cruises.",1
615,"“A lot of my clients used to be the honeymoon couple where one was vegan and the other wasn’t, or the one child in the family was the vegan.",0
615,"Now it’s the couple where both are vegan or the whole family’s vegan,” Zeigfinger added.",0
615,"“When it comes to accommodation, hotels must consider more than just food.",0
615,Hotels need to be accommodating when it comes to things like bedding.,0
615,"Most nowadays will provide allergy-free bedding, so that means no feather pillows or wool blankets.",0
615,Most of the tour operators these days now have a better understanding of what a vegan is and will go out of their way to accommodate people.,0
615,"If not, we don’t use them again,” she explained.",0
615,Managing director Dirk Bocklage has come up with the idea of hosting murder mystery dinners and theatre events and performed on cruise ships.,0
615,"One of the newest players in the vegan vacation market is CPG Vegan Trips, a travel firm which allows tourists to spend some time with animals without causing them any harm.",0
615,"Founded by the renowned animal advocate and author Colleen Patrick-Goudreau, it hosted its first wildlife trip for 22 people to Thailand in October last year.",0

633,The burnt powdered form of charcoal adds the smoky flavour and the crispiness in the food.,0
633,It is known for its properties of acting as a natural purifier and as an antioxidant and also helps in getting rid of hangovers and other impurities present in the body.,0

647,"Scientists and vintners need to better understand the wide diversity of grapes and their adaptions to different climates, according to Elizabeth Wolkovich, assistant professor at Harvard University in the US.",0
647,"""It's going to be very hard for many regions to continue growing the exact varieties they've grown in the past,"" Wolkovich said.",0
647,"""The Old World has a huge diversity of winegrapes - there are over planted 1,000 varieties - and some of them are better adapted to hotter climates and have higher drought tolerance than the 12 varieties now making up over 80 per cent of the wine market in many countries,"" she said.",0
647,"""We should be studying and exploring these varieties to prepare for climate change,"" she added.",1
647,"Convincing wine producers to try different grape varieties is difficult at best, and the reason often comes down to the current concept of terroir - the notion that a wine's flavour is a reflection of where, which and how the grapes were grown.",0
647,"As currently understood, only certain traditional or existing varieties are part of each terroir, leaving little room for change.",0
647,"Even if winemakers were open to switching to new varieties, researchers do not have enough data to say whether other varieties would be able to adapt to climate change.",1
647,"""Right now we know we have this diversity, but we have little information on how to use it,"" said Ignacio Morales- Castilla, from Harvard University.",0
647,"""One of our other suggestions is for growers to start setting aside parts of vineyards to grow some other varieties to see which ones are working,"" said Castilla, who investigates which winegrape varieties will adequately mature where under climate change.",0
647,"Even if researchers came to the table armed with information about grape diversity, Wolkovich said the industry still faces hurdles when it comes to making changes.",1
647,"In Europe, growers have more than 1,000 grape varieties to choose from, research repositories such as INRA's Domaine de Vassal that study this diversity, and expertise in how to grow different varieties.",0

651,"It is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, and currently affects 57.5 million people, and is expected to increase to 65.5 million by 2020.",0
651,"Previous research suggests that caffeine can alter intraocular pressure, but no study so far has compared the potential impact of decaffeinated and caffeinated drinks on glaucoma risk.",0

653,"While talking about his book, Shepherd shared, “You don’t just put wine in your mouth and leave it there.",1
653,"You move it about and then swallow it, which is a very complex motor act.”

The brain plays a very important role in deciphering the taste of wine.",0
653,Shepherd likened it to the way our eyes perceive colours.,0
653,“The analogy one can use is colour.,0
653,"The objects we see don’t have colour themselves - light hits them and bounces off,” noted Shephard.",0
653,"He further said, “It’s when light strikes our eyes that it activates systems in the brain that create colour from those different wavelengths.",0

655,"And, just like the previous year, the government did squat about it.",0
655,So we all set ourselves to finding cures for it.,0
655,"From helping in skyrocketing the sales of air purifiers to stuffing our houses with camphor and snake plants to the rafters, and gulping down jaggery by the kilo, we did everything in an effort to keep our lungs somewhat healthy or at best, least diseased.",0
655,"Another natural product I turned to was honey, if not to fight pollution but at least to keep my cough at bay.",1
655,"Honey mixed with roasted ginger and black pepper is the best grandma’s cure for a cough, one that now finds scientific backing to suggest it may be even better than certain cough syrups in the market.",0
655,"Don’t forget that honey is essentially stored bee food so it is naturally high in calories but it can still be marginally healthier than sugar, especially for diabetics.",0
655,"Sure honey isn’t quite the vitamin and mineral source (or fat, fibre and protein source) that many marketing claims make it out to be but it is rich in certain plant-origin bio-active compounds, which are good for us.",0
655,"It is also rich in antioxidants, an idea that is the single most important revenue-churner for the ‘reverse ageing’ cosmetic industry.",1
655,"But more than just reducing wrinkles, antioxidants can reduce chances of heart-related issues, and can even be anti-carcinogenic.",0
655,It lowers LDL and blood pressure—two things that are good to sustain a healthy heart.,0
655,"Clearly, the extra calories that honey brings to the mix are easily offset by the benefits it provides.",0
655,So how does one choose a good brand?,0
655,"Well, organic certification is always a good measure but it is an expensive one.",0
655,So many producers may prefer to save the change and invest it in ensuring healthier beehives.,0
655,"One way to do this is the same way as McDonald’s does it, choosing the right location.",1
655,"The higher one goes in altitude, the more verdant and nature-rich the surroundings become, which allow bees’ access to better raw material.",0
655,So you can have honey from all sorts of flowers to fruits like the Indian blackberry or even mustard.,0
655,Purity is a concern but don’t bother doing the burn test or the ‘does it hold shape when poured into water’ one.,0
655,Most honey brands will ensure compliance there.,1
655,Bees can make honey even in crowded cities but the quality isn’t great.,0
655,"Maintaining hives in high altitude farms is costly so when you see honey priced differently, apart from the pretty packaging, you may be paying for the difficult sourcing costs being incurred by the maker.",0

657,"“As the team leader, I take ownership but the redressal has to be a united and strong effort,” he says.",1
657,"Salmon Lollipop

657,"“I have been pushing for fresh, local produce since I started out.",0
657,"Quite challenging, with Insta food narratives dominating the foodscape.",0

657,“My only parameter is goodness.,0
657,"So while I source ingredients locally as much as I can, for instance in Mumbai, I get my fish from Kochi as the varieties in Mumbai simply do not measure up in taste.”

Despite being a highly sought -after chef for 14 years, Chandra is averse to posturing on social media.",0
657,"“I simply loathe the vanity investment,” he says.",0
657,"So while he isn’t really the Twitter king, the economy of tweets appeals to him as he airs his opinions.",1

657,Don’t depend on others.,0
657,"Be hands-on, and work on your shortcomings.”",0
658,"There are some distinct ingredients that add a unique taste to our cooking, and our favourite dishes become less interesting without them.",0
658,"Drumsticks or moringa (long slender, triangular seed-pods) have great importance in many south Indian delicacies such as sambar, rasam, avial etc.",0
658,"Unlike today, moringa was a lesser known vegetable to north Indian people but in the south we had a tree in every kitchen garden as it was ideal soil to grow a moringa plant.",0
658,"Once the plant grows to a usual height of 6/7 metres, you have regular yield for domestic use and sometimes more to give away.",0
658,"Kids were taught how to eat these hard-looking, long pieces of drumsticks in our curries: “Gently split them open and separate the creamy flesh with your teeth and enjoy the pleasant flavour”.",0
658,"Along with popularity of south Indian food away from home, like other ingredients, drumsticks too travelled far and wide, yet people wouldn’t like this vegetable until they learn to eat the soft flesh inside and discard the fibrous exterior.",0
658,"Occasionally, people even misunderstand it for okra and chew drumstick for long time and make funny remarks like “dish was very tasty but that okra was under-cooked!”

Later, as healthy eating became a focal point for many, especially in the last decade or so, people discovered other uses of moringa tree.",0
658,Its leaves are used in daily diet due to its highly nutritious qualities; people are getting used to its slightly sharper taste.,0
658,Until recently we didn’t know about delicious warm salads made of moringa flowers and they taste amazing too; you can feel lightness as you complete a meal with them.,0
658,"All these dishes were already part of a village meal, especially agro families.",0
658,That was only half the story of illustrious moringa family and its use in our food and medicines.,0
658,Meeting Nanalal Satra in Bengaluru was a pleasant surprise as he started talking about his successful export of moringa oil to Germany.,1
658,"Unfortunately, many of us wouldn’t have even heard of this oil, which has a variety of usage and a tremendous demand in Europe.",0
658,Purabi Sarkar has done research on moringa oil and travels around spreading benefits of this special oil and we were lucky enough to listen to one of her lectures.,1
658,Purabi talked about moringa oil’s rich vitamin and unsaturated fatty acid qualities.,0
658,It is also used to increase health and strength of hair and scalp.,0
658,Moringa oil is extracted by pressing the seeds of Moringa oleifera.,1
658,"Countries such as India and Sri Lanka, and Africa produce the best variety, also called Ben oil, which has high amounts of behenic acid.",0
658,There are so many good qualities and reasons to show the superior demand for moringa oil.,0
658,"No wonder, it was mentioned as a very useful oil in Ayurveda, and the medicinal books of Greece and Rome.",0
658,"The oil contains antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, which help in curing cuts, bruises, burns, insect bites and rashes.",0
658,"It’s also supposed to be a nice cooking oil owing to its soft, appealing taste, though it’s more expensive than the many others available and subject to availability.",0
658,"Ayurveda doctor Sanand suggests, “Moringa oil is good for people with sleeping disorders, prevents ageing and contains aphrodisiac elements.”

Time and again, it is revealed that simple, wholesome foods like moringa provide incredible balance to our health and happiness.",0
658,"As Purabi insists, “We need to educate people and develop these nature’s remedies for everyday living, with increased demand.",0
658,It will enhance interest for large-scale production of moringa oil.,1
658,We have the best quality moringa in our region and ideal weather conditions to cultivate it.” The author runs the London-based Rasa chain of restaurants,0
659,Every family has some special recipes that they cherish.,0
659,"These are the dishes full of stories that bring back the feeling of warmth, comfort and simplicity every time they are made.",0
659,"While for many of us they just remain the delicacies cooked by mothers or grandmothers and are lost with the changing times, some make a point to carry forward the family legacy.",0
659,"Here we speak to some chefs, who have either recreated the heritage recipes or dishes of their childhood.",0
659,Some are presenting these in their menus in a new avatar making a personalised statement while others are re-producing them as authentic as they can be for food lovers’ delight.,0
659,"Culinary journey of Balaji Natarajan, Executive Sous Chef, Park Hyatt, Chennai, is loaded with childhood memories of his grandma’s food.",1
659,"So, he has dedicated some dishes to his family and traditions.",0
659,Balaji takes pride in introducing his native region and its traditional cuisine.,0
659,“I am a ‘Kongu Tamilian’ belonging to a region called Kongunadu in Tamil Nadu.,0
659,"This cuisine is a collection of recipes from more than 50 cities in Tamil Nadu, unlike Chettinad cuisine—food of only one city of Tamil Nadu called Karaikudi,” he says.",0
659,“Kongunadu cuisine does not involve marination of any raw material.,0
659,"Addition of roasted groundnut paste to curries and Khormas creates a very different flavour.”

As a child, Balaji spent all his time in the joint family set-up in Sathyamangalam.",0
659,"From that memory, he shares one of his family’s recipe of Kambu Paniyaram.",0
659,"“Kambu means pearl millet, Paniyaram means a dumpling,” he says.",0
659,"“Kambu Paniyaram can be enjoyed any time of the day.”

He says his grandma used traditional stone grinder called ‘Attangal’ to grind the millet batter.",0
659,‘Aruvamanai’ is traditional equipment used in villages for grating coconuts and for cutting vegetables.,0

659,“I remember my early childhood years when my grandfather would take me to this shop.,0
659,"The shop was set up on the auspicious occasion of Lohri in 1948, after the family migrated to Delhi from Lahore.",0
659,Lahore ki Pinni has been on their menu since the first Republic Day in 1950 and no Delhi winter of mine was complete without biting into the delightful Madan Pinni.,0
659,"The sense of joy I get after biting into something so simple yet so memorable is awesome.”

Going back to their roots, celebrated chefs are digging into history and making utmost efforts to preserve our rich culinary traditions.",0
659,"Chef Arun Sundararaj, Executive Chef, The Taj Mahal Hotel, New Delhi, says, “At Varq, we constantly endeavour to offer unique and meaningful experiences by frequently curating special menus inspired by flavours from different corners of the country.",0
659,"For example, we crafted a special menu ‘Lost Recipes of the Royals’ which brought forth forgotten recipes from the royal kitchens of four erstwhile kingdoms of India—Kashmiri Dogras, the kings of Travancore, the Nizams of Hyderabad and the Mewars of Rajasthan.",0
659,"The menu featured regal dishes like Pattode ke kebab, Tujji chicken, Paneer gulnar kebab, Nizami saada aash, Cheera ada curry, Noori Hyderabadi biryani and desserts like garlic kheer with broken wheat porridge.",0
659,We familiarised ourselves with the various cooking techniques used in these kitchens.,0
659,"For Saada Aash, the Nizami lamb soup is simmered for seven hours and tempered seven times before it is served.",0
659,"Khichdi Rafat is the Nizami royals’ twist to the humble khichdi cooked with tender pieces of chicken, duck, lamb, almonds and aromatic spices.”

Talking about his favourite recipe, Arun says, “Duet of Paasley Angeera and Murgh Hawa Mahal is my favourite.",0
659,"Inspired by the kings of Mewar, the dish is our take on the signature Rajasthani lamb chop and cooked the traditional way on charcoal.”

Desi Citiwala Kukkad is one dish that steals the show in the genre of heritage recipes at Hotel Fairmont, Jaipur.",0
659,"Executive Chef Manpreet Singh Mallik says, “The dish is inspired by and dedicated to all the home cooks, mothers, dhabas and the real rustic cuisine of India.",0
659,"While conversing with the guests we realised that they often want to taste the traditional foods.”

He adds: “So we selected chicken-based dish.",0
659,We have tied up with a local farmer from a nearby village to source our desi murga.,0
659,"The masalas are hand-ground in a mortar and pestle (imam dasta), and then carefully cooked in pressure cooker.",0
659,"This dish is cooked on the bone, which ensures all the flavour remains in the curry.",0
659,"We serve it in a tiny pressure cooker, while it is still hot.”

661,"A new research has found that women are majorly affected by the eating disorder, also defined as a mental disorder that causes abnormal eating habits and negatively affects a person's physical or mental health.",1
661,"Disruptions in the eating behaviour may not necessarily be motivated by the drive for pursuit of thinness or any distortion of body image, but rather gender expectations and pressures from a culturally dominated society.",0

1) Sweet - Very picky about their wines.",0

662,"3) Sensitive – In the middle of the wine-drinking spectrum, are people who are sensitive.",0
662,They are flexible and adventurous.,0
662,The researchers say these people will also tend to display signs of being free-spirited and less rigid in everyday life.,1

your system.",0

664,"In the last few years, ordering in has come a long way, from the local dhaba where one sent the atta and got back cooked tandoori rotis to curating a Southeast or Far East Asian menu with all the necessary condiments, home delivery has made me less social than the worst of WhatsApp groups!",0
664,Today ordering in is such a lucrative category that a lot of restaurants regard their brick-and-mortar outlet as merely a shop window to the real cash cow.,0
664,"They put up with exorbitant rents in ludicrously posh markets just to get people to try their ware and then get the hitched on to the, pun intended, delivery wagon.",0
664,"Just look at Noshi, they charge a hefty 10 per cent as packing charge and I never once shudder while paying it because the way their food turns up at home is better than what many a restaurant can manage in their salons!",0

664,"Good-To-Go is another app, I heavily rely on for my raw ingredients (meats mainly) and their carbon-ice fresh delivery standards have got me fish so fresh I could style sushi out of it.",0

664,"Even the local desi kitchens have upped their ante: from heat-preserving packaging to heat-and-serve

(and reusable) containers, it’s very commendable.",0
664,Domino’s was possibly the first success in the delivery space but since then have lost their edge: their pizzas were barely average but their 30-minutes-or-less standard still made them a reliable proposition.,0

665,WASHINGTON: Your favourite pizza topping could you help fight aging!,0
665,A team of Penn State researchers found mushrooms are rich in antioxidants that scientists say could be used fight aging and boost general health.,1
665,"The study suggests that mushrooms have high amounts of the ergothioneine and glutathione, both important antioxidants, said Professor Robert Beelman.",1
665,He added that the researchers also found that the amounts the two compounds varied greatly between mushroom species.,1
665,"""What we found is that, without a doubt, mushrooms are highest dietary source of these two antioxidants taken together, and that some types are really packed with both of them,"" said Beelman.",0
665,"Beelman said that when the body uses food to produce energy, it also causes oxidative stress because some free radicals are produced.",0
665,"Free radicals are oxygen atoms with unpaired electrons that cause damage to cells, proteins and even DNA as these highly reactive atoms travel through the body seeking to pair up with other electrons.",0
665,"Replenishing antioxidants in the body, then, may help protect against this oxidative stress.",0
665,"""There's a theory -- the free radical theory of aging -- that's been around for a long time that says when we oxidize our food to produce energy there's a number of free radicals that are produced that are side products of that action and many of these are quite toxic,"" said Beelman.",0
665,"""The body has mechanisms to control most of them, including ergothioneine and glutathione, but eventually enough accrue to cause damage, which has been associated with many of the diseases of aging, like cancer, coronary heart disease and Alzheimer's.""",0
665,"According to the researchers, the amounts of ergothioneine and glutathione in mushrooms vary by species with the porcini species, a wild variety, containing the highest amount of the two compounds among the 13 species tested.",0
665,"""We found that the porcini has the highest, by far, of any we tested,"" said Beelman.",0
665,"""This species is really popular in Italy where searching for it has become a national pastime.""",0
665,"The more common mushroom types, like the white button, had less of the antioxidants, but had higher amounts than most other foods, Beelman said.",0
665,"The amount of ergothioneine and glutathione also appear to be correlated in mushrooms, the researchers said.",1
665,"Mushrooms that are high in glutathione are also high in ergothioneine, for example.",1
665,"Cooking mushrooms does not seem to significantly affect the compounds, Beelman said.",0
665,"""Ergothioneine are very heat stable,"" said Beelman.",0
665,"Beelman said that future research may look at any role that ergothioneine and glutathione have in decreasing the likelihood of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.",0
665,"""It's preliminary, but you can see that countries that have more ergothioneine in their diets, countries like France and Italy, also have lower incidences of neurodegenerative diseases, while people in countries like the United States, which has low amounts of ergothioneine in the diet, have a higher probability of diseases like Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's,"" said Beelman.",0
665,"""Now, whether that's just a correlation or causative, we don't know.",0
665,"But, it's something to look into, especially because the difference between the countries with low rates of neurodegenerative diseases is about three milligrams per day, which is about five button mushrooms each day.""",0

676,"The skull is an intriguing entry point, and it manages to underpin the entire narrative of Kim A Wagner’s new book The Skull of Alum Bheg: The Life and Death of Rebel of 1857.",1
676,"From this grisly starting point, Wagner narrates how, in the summer heat of mid-1857, native Bengal Army units at Sialkot mutinied, killing officers and civilians and looting the cantonment, and then set out for Delhi to join Bahadur Shah, the briefly-minted ‘Emperor of India’.",0
676,They didn’t make it.,0
676,John Nicholson intercepted them with a British force as they tried to cross the Ravi river.,0
676,"Three days later, Nicholson annihilated the 1,100 trapped sepoys in the Battle of Trimmu Ghat.",0

676,It is also about the experience of ordinary people from different parts of the world whose lives were drastically changed or cut short by the events of 1857 and soon after.,0
676,It is more of a reconstruction of history rather than a biography of Alum Bheg.,0
676,And Wagner makes it believable; his depiction of life and death on the ground is helped by the depth of research and thickly footnoted academic rigor as it is by his evident passion for history and flair for language.,0

681,"In a bid to escape their fates, Paul and Clara convert to Christianity.",0
681,It amounts to nothing as they are only known for their non-Aryan heritage and treated Jews are.,0
681,Lillian is brought up as a Catholic.,0
681,This unique situation of crossing the boundaries of religious identity is the stronger story and has been dealt with only in passing.,1
681,To those interested in Nazi era Germany this is a must read.,0
682,"While reading a work of non-fiction, issues that matter are not just the author’s thought process, perspective and ability to look at facts dispassionately but also their body of work as one entity.",0
682,The first introduction of Mehr Tarar to Indian readers is as a woman who was mocked and demonised in the media for her supposed involvement with a leading politician and the war of words that ensued between interested parties.,0
682,It was not very tasteful.,0
682,Subsequently Tarar was scorned on both sides of the border.,0

682,"But above all, she addresses humanity within her nation’s context, moving the reader with the complexity of belief.",0
682,"Do We Not Bleed is a portmanteau of stories within a story, that houses a holistic national sentiment.",0
682,"It is through this perspective that I read the book; a sight I had gained, too, by a present on-the-ground understanding of Pakistan and expansive professional work on the arts and socio-cultural issues on a national and global scale where the chaos of the country is as visible as the beauty of its past.",0
682,Tarar’s book is a journey through the vast spectrum of layered history and the individual choices of the dramatis personae of her land’s tale.,0
682,She addresses the contradiction of Jinnah’s love to create a country based on Islam— an ideal nation of peace and prosperity—and the hard facts of religion interfering with governance and the corruption in its politics and polity that has created many a catastrophe for the land of her birth.,0
682,Her language is delicately detailed yet the words hit home hard.,0
682,Tarar throws caution to the wind and redeems herself in unwilling eyes with the grace and aplomb of a master scribe who knows what she is talking of and does it with a compassionate understanding of life and people.,0
682,The account of each individual’s life in the book is factual and lucidly descriptive.,1

683,"After having spent most of her childhood in namma Chennai, Shoba went on to graduate from the Columbia Journalism School, where she was awarded with a Pulitzer Fellowship.",1
683,"Having spent 20 years in the US, Shoba is now settled in Bengaluru with her family.",0
683,"The award-winning author talks to us about her book, love for the city and culture.",0
683,"“The beauty of cows is that you can expand it to look at anything in our country, so I was using that as an anchor to explore all that is happening and going on in India.” The book starts with an anecdote about the time when she saw a cow in the elevator of her apartment, brought in for a house-warming ceremony.",0
683,"Her Eureka moment for the book happened when she befriended Sarala, the lady who brought milk for her, and they shared a special relationship.",0
683,“We all encounter so many people in our daily lives like the isthiri wala and the flower vendor.,0
683,"But Sarala was unusual; she is very generous, a great story teller, she loves cows and moreover she was able to explain it in a way that somebody who is cynical can understand.",0
683,Her personality is what gave rise to the book.” Shoba explains.,1
683,"The book which is a simple narrative that happened organically over 10 years in Shoba’s life includes the story of how she went around villages in Karnataka with Sarala to buy her a new cow, with the money that she had given the latter on loan.",0
683,"“One day she came up to me and said ‘Amma, can you give me a loan of `40,000, I want to buy a cow.’ And being the good storyteller that she is, she convinced me to do the same.",0
683,"We looked at around 30 cows before settling on Anandalakshmi,” she says.",0
683,The book further looks into all the aspects of a cow and how it is an important part of the mythology and Indian culture.,0
683,"“Anything with ‘go’ is linked to the cow (Godavari, Gotra, Gopal).",0
683,"We introduced ghee and the cow was the source of it, we used the same ghee to do agni homam and reach out to god.",0
683,"Even in Vedic times, they would domesticate other animals like sheep, buffalo, horses, etc.",0
683,So then why did they chose the cow of all those to be a sacred animal?” she asks.,0
683,The only challenge Shoba faced was when she had to decide whether to include the political aspects of the topic.,1
683,"“In India, the cow has become a political topic, so I had to make the choice if I should include it.",1
683,"As a vegetarian who loves animals I decided that if I have to do this halfway political thing I would have to get into the butchering and slaughtering, which I did not have the stomach for,” she says.",0
684,This is an interesting bouquet of poetry from the former editor-in-chief of DNA.,0
684,His experiences in the literary world and life in general seem to have seeped through the recesses of his poetry.,1
684,There is a glimmer of darkness where the world scampers for light.,0
684,One agrees with Ranjit Hoskote’s inference in his forward which sees CP’s work as clearly not ‘entertain[ing] an unduly optimistic belief in the human animal’s belief to redeem itself from its failings’.,0
684,"In fact it is this quality that makes his work unique and brings out the decadence of the masses in a world, which in lapses of moments, is sliding to nothingness.",0
684,What is left out is daily life.,0
684,What is captivated is the wisdom of trials.,0
684,This quality runs through the entire stream of his poetry rightly justified by his writings in tribute to Vijay Nambisan at the beginning of the book.,0
684,CP stands by the man’s integrity and a hope lost in the faith towards humanity uplifting itself by spirit in life when it is so base materially while dealing with men and women of creative and honest spirit.,0
684,From this spring of the spewed raw truth rises the despair in CP’s verse.,0
684,The works may describe everyday life yet are decadent and reveal subtleties of the dark recesses of human turmoil beautifully.,0
684,There is a sense of nothingness as far as time is concerned and life moves on even with the worst turmoil.,0
684,"The poems do not care to lend themselves to a poignant experience but are meant to show the facets, though sometimes ugly and sometimes devoid of life, in their entirety.",0
684,Some of the verses are uncomfortable to read and they are meant to be so.,0
684,There is no release or catharsis but a brilliance of the ultimate truth of life.,1
684,Life goes on in his works in a sauntering sort of a gait.,0
684,CP has also been careful not to show pity to the self in his works from memory and stayed away from a poignant attitude towards past events.,0
684,"Though the beautiful textures of darkness are brought out gently and not as a force unleashed, one can see he is capable of the sensitive positive subtleties, though he seems vary of it.",0
684,In some places within his verse he lapses into private moments that are incomprehensible and emerges again in shifts of expression of the lack of expectation of life and its events.,0
684,It is only in the darkness of the truth revealed does one find rest and freedom in his work.,1
684,One feels a holding back as far as the energy of the verse is concerned almost as if left unsaid with the will wanting.,0
684,"The verses in ‘Contentment’, seem to distil the essence of this particular collection of poems in their revelation of life, discovery of the nether, dealing with it and moving on to a mundane regular living with a brilliance in even its lack of meaning.",0
684,In that understanding does the poet gain his freedom.,0
684,Let the truth of darkness be unfolded layer by layer in the escaping joys of the vision of positivity that life is a mirage of.,1
684,If you are looking for poetry as a lyric of a romantic imaginative soul to utopia this book is not for you.,0
684,"But if you have the courage to live life and face its beautiful, spellbinding greys then this might just be your call.",0

There seems to be a feeling of loss and melancholy running through most of your works in this collection.",0
684,"Well, I am not sure about the melancholy part of it, as it is a coinage that gained currency, I believe, with the Romantic period.",0
684,I am no great Romantic.,0
684,The sense of loss though is real.,0
684,And I think it might have a lot to do with a certain aspect of my childhood.,0
684,"In my case, the sense of loss—not unmixed with anger— is the constant feeling that I have betrayed the child in me, and perhaps in others.",0
684,"Your first collection Gemini II has a clipped, terse, controlled tone to it.",0
684,"From there to Available Light, which has a personal view of the world, how do you think your writing has evolved?",0
684,The terseness you mention stems mostly from an unrelenting pursuit of the past; a dig and search operation.,0
684,Not that one succeeded in the mission.,0
684,The current crop of poems is relatively an outward journey primarily because they seem to reconcile to the possibility that the world outside the self is just as f****d up as the self.,0
684,"In this age of instant coffee and WhatsApp messages, have we stopped enjoying poetry?",0
684,I believe it is not so much as enjoying poetry as a fierce disrespect ingrained in the perception of it.,0
684,Poetry as we perceive it in India can be anything so long as the lines are short.,0
684,The general result is a secret scorn and contempt in the higher circles of the literati.,0
684,"The bad name that poetry is stigmatised with is because of the proliferation of bad poets, an ill spread by the agency of social media, perhaps.",0
684,"Also, we have now instant poetry and flash fiction.",0
684,"These are jokes, of course.",0
684,"Because all you are trying to do is to be catchy, to cater to the flies teeming in the market with their all too brief attention spans.",0
684,"In 2017, slam poetry made its strong presence felt in Indian metros.",0
684,Do you think it’s here to stay?,0
684,Performance helps the reception of poetry.,0
684,But performance could also be at the expense of poetry.,0
684,"I remember a lady with whom I shared a stage, reading utter drivel but in a most rousing way.",0
684,"The audience, especially women, was bowled over.",0
684,Yet the poetry itself was just rhetoric.,0
684,Slam poetry is here to stay; it’d be great if it does not slam poetry.,0
684,I see the future of poetry closely associated with the internet.,0
684,"Podcasts, for example.",0
684,But I am not sure if that takes away from the experience of hearing a good poet read his lines in real life.,0
684,Poetry finds few takers today.,0
684,"Is there a lack of mainstream publishers willing to publish poetry, a dwindling number of readers willing to buy it, or few bookshops ready to stock books of poetry?",0
684,"At the risk of sounding contradictory, I believe there’s a rise in the audience.",0
684,There is in fact a return of sorts.,0
684,But very few publishers realise it.,0
684,Bookshops tend not to store poetry collections simply because very few poets get media attention.,0
684,"The general fever is fiction and, now, non-fiction.",0
684,Which is why I believe poetry would be written in a state of helplessness.,1
685,"Sanjoy Hazarika is one of the most credible and authoritative voices on North-East India, that triangular stretch of land beyond what is known as the Chicken’s Neck.",1
685,"An award-winning journalist, formerly with the New York Times, Hazarika has written extensively about the North-East, a region which a majority, in what is known as ‘mainland India’, know little and understand even less so.",1
685,"Strangers No More: New Narratives from India’s North-East is the latest from Hazarika following his earlier acclaimed works—Strangers of the Mist: Tales of War and Peace from India’s North-East and Rites of Passage: Border Crossings, Imagined Homelands, India‘s East and Bangladesh.",1
685,"In that sense, Strangers No More is truly “the most comprehensive book yet available about India’s North-East”, as the book’s blurb aptly says.",1
685,"North-East is an extremely complex region, both geographically and culturally—“nearly 96 per cent of the region’s borders are with other countries; only 4 per cent of the border is connected to the rest of India”.",0
685,"Home to innumerable tribes, many of who do not trust the other, and immigrants from neighbouring regions who settled here over a century, the region is a complex anthropological mix.",0
685,Add to this the fact that most borders in the region—both international and national—are disputed makes it more complicated.,0
685,Hazarika threads through these complexities with a discerning eye and an unbiased manner.,0
685,He traces the history of the region to detail the issues plaguing the region and understand the aspirations of the people.,1
685,"Apart from shared ethnicities with neighbouring countries and China’s geo-political interests that makes the region a combustive political arena, one thing that comes out clearly in the book are the wrongly motivated and at time almost farcical Indian efforts to bring peace to the region.",0
685,The book details historical mistakes and current vested interests that have alienated the people in the region.,0
685,"Even 70 years after Independence, Indian authorities continue to be seen with mistrust.",0
685,"The reason is not difficult to understand—false promises by the authorities over decades, failure to resolve burning issues and almost constant use of Disturbed Areas Act in the region that has resulted in grave human rights violations.",0
685,The most vexatious issue has no doubt been rule by AFSPA.,0
685,"The free hand given to the armed, paramilitary and police forces in the region under AFSPA, dating back to 1958, has been the biggest impediment in the integration of the region with the rest of India.",0
685,"Hazarika brings out the horrors of the AFSPA rule through stories—from the much publicised shooting of Manorama and fast of Irom Sharmila to lesser known Ananda Kalita, who was shot in the head and yet miraculously survived, to Mohammed Azad Khan, a 12-year-old picked up from his home and beaten and shot in a rice field, to Felanee, a 15-year-old shot while she was trying to cross the barbed wire fence from India to Bangladesh.",0
685,"Hazarika’s book is, in fact, a cry to remove AFSPA.",0
685,"It cites the trailblazing example of Tripura, which through “good governance” and “political tact” “turned the clock back by lifting the Disturbed Areas Act, which essentially ends AFSPA rule and sends the troops back to their barracks.” Therein lies the hope for the rest of the region.",0
686,"CHENNAI:In Priya Babu’s work, transwomen take centre stage.",0
686,"She is a scriptwriter, filmmaker, a researcher, and a transwoman based in Madurai, with a keen interest in interpreting histories of her community.",1
686,"Anyone familiar with her work would know that it shakes prejudices as we learn of transpersons’ lives in all fronts — from their duties as the queen’s apprentice during the Chola period, to their depiction in Bhakti literature.",0
686,"In an interview with CE, she talks about her upcoming film and its drive to show the stark presence of transgenders’ lives in Tamil history.",1
686,The idea for this documentary came when her previous film could not fully incorporate her research.,0
686,"“It was on transgender folk art in Tamil Nadu, which released in 2005.",1
686,"I had travelled across the state and collected a lot of information about the depiction of trans lives in Tholkapiam, Jeevakasintamani, Silapathikaram, and Bhakti literature,” she shares.",0
686,"For about eight years after that, she collected books, and sought help from various centres including National Folklore Support Centre, Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department, Tanjavur Archaeology Department, Ramanathapuram Aranmanai, and centres in other parts of south Tamil Nadu.She shares that her inquisitiveness was new to the people she met, as she asked ‘What were transgender relationships like in the confines of a place?’ ‘What circles did they move in?’ ‘What positions of power did they hold?’ and more importantly, for her film, ‘How could she picturise these histories from the past?’

“I thought docu-drama would be more interesting, so we can explore the representation of their lives better.",0
686,"There are aranmanai scenes from Chola and Chera periods that have transpersons in decision-making positions,” she explains, adding that it is fully based on evidence.Most of the pre-production work for the docu-drama is complete, there’s a lot left to be done.",0
686,"She says that financial support has been

minimal so far, and most of it is volunteer driven.",0
686,"“Production costs are going to be high, and while the technical team is almost in place, we are yet to do a recce and auditions, and figure out the logistics,” she adds.",0
686,"To garner more support, a few months back, Priya launched an app called Idaiyinam.",0
686,"It informs people about the film, and ways to offer support to the team.",0
686,"As she prepares for the poster release and shooting scheduled to start mid-April, she admits there have been many challenges.",0
686,"But being able to reclaim transgender histories, that was never erased in the first place, is the underlying intention of her work.",1
686,"“Mainstreaming our histories, and making others sensitive to our lives, is what keeps my work happy and going,” she shares.",1
687,"Book: Why I Killed the Mahatma -- Uncovering Godse's Defence; Author: Koenraad Elst; Publisher: Rupa; Pages: 251

""History will be kind to me for I intend to write it,"" Winston Churchill had bragged with his trademark flourish, underlining the significant role which victors play in scripting the histories of their respective eras.",0
687,"Koenraad Elst's provocatively titled book ""Why I killed the Mahatma..."", is a dissertation examining Gandhi's killer Nathuram Godse's defence in court during his trial, which eventually led to his hanging.",0
687,"And with this book, Elst, a Belgian Indologist, walks a path rarely trod on by other mainstream Indian historians, which involves the sensitive and precarious task of intellectualising Godse's rationale, which eventually led to the assassination.",0
687,"Koenraad Elst's book 'Why I killed the Mahatma' (Photo | Amazon)

This is essential, according to Elst, who claims that a section of Indian historians have, for long, monopolised views on Gandhi's assassination, thereby eclipsing any other aspects linked to the saga which led to the Mahatma's killing, like Godse's point of view.",0
687,"""The fact that he murdered the Mahatma has eclipsed every other fact in his fairly long and detailed statement.",0
687,"We hope that this study will enable the readers to see Godse with their own eyes rather than through the eyes of those who have thus far monopolised the discourse on the Mahatma's murder,"" Elst says, while pointing out to the significance of Godse's insistence on taking the absolute onus for the assassination, in an attempt to absolve his friends and other alleged conspirators.",0
687,"Elst also attempts to bring out similar traits between the nearly anonymous (at the time) killer and his larger-than-life victim, like the similarities in their respective childhoods, when both believed in a supernatural sense.",0
687,"Godse, Elst says, as a child acted as the oracle of the family goddess, while Gandhi had invoked his inner voice to rational considerations right from a younger age.",1
687,"""Logically following from the conviction, common to both Gandhi and Godse, that 'the problem of India was basically the problem of the Hindus', if there is another importance parallel: both were hard on their own Hindu society, not on Muslims,"" the author states in the book, which is bound to raise more than a few eyebrows.",0
687,"Much like Gandhi, Elst maintains, Godse too refused to let Hindus lay the blame for their sufferings in the era preceding Independence and Partition elsewhere, but on themselves.",1
687,"""It is remarkable that Godse, who profiles himself as a secular nationalist, puts a decisive part of the blame for the Pakistan movement on the British.",0
687,"He makes no attempt to link the contemporary phenomenon of Islamic separatism with the fundamental doctrines of Islam,"" a passage in the book reads.",0
687,"Interestingly, the book also attempts to train the spotlight on what Elst prefers to call the secular side of Godse.",1
687,"The author claims that Godse swore by genuinely secular and democratic principles, so that all Indians should enjoy equal rights and complete equality on the basis of democracy and no special privileges on the basis of communal identity such as weightage in parliamentary representation of Muslims, something the ""so-called secularists"" of the era were in favour of.",0
687,"""Congressites and leftist secularists, by contrast, supported communal representation and weightage back then, and still support separate Personal Law systems for different communities defined by religion today.",0
687,"If words still have a meaning, Godse's vision of independent India's polity was more secular than that of self-styled secularists,"" Elst claims in his book.",1
687,"Elst also points out to what he suggests is an inconsistency in Gandhi's usage of fasting as a tool for bringing about peace, alleging that the Mahatma used the tool to good effect only with people who admired and loved him, and never against his opponents.",0
687,"""For instance, he did not use this weapon in order to compel the Muslim League to give up its demand for Pakistan.",0
687,"Indeed, breaking a solemn promise, he failed to stake his life for the sake of India's unity,"" the book claims.",1
687,"Elst's book is an attempt to provide an intellectual rationale for Godse's actions, while at the same time, not underlining the rights or the wrongs of the act of pumping bullets into the Mahatma, the first major and perhaps the most significant assassination in free India.",0
687,"As contemporary India's political history changes course, such revisiting of past phenomena, occurrences and recording of an alternative discourse/s around them, may well trigger a new round of ideological churning.",0
688,Globalisation's retreat and the consequent rise of a rather hyper form of nationalism -- which even seeks to confine indivisible human endeavours like art and science within borders -- is one of the most worrying trends of our time.,0
688,"Equally of concern is the trade-off between prosperity and liberty, and a sense of conformity being forced on us.",1
688,How do we face these challenges?,0
688,"One way would be to go back to the thoughts of a charismatic French existentialist philosopher -- the man who identified the ""absurd"" existence we find ourselves in, and suggested ways of escaping it.",1
688,"But Albert Camus, who staunchly stood for human freedom beyond the constraints of ideology, and opposed totalitarianism of all types, had dealt with these issues in the last two decades of his tragically short life.",0
688,"And he expressed his views not only in his writings but also in public gatherings, from colleges to labour exchanges.",1
688,"And in this installment of the thin, nearly-weightless, pocket-sized special edition of Penguin Modern Classics, we can hear Camus, who was noted for his incisive thought on serious issues of existence presented in a most accessible manner, deal with matters that were as important in his time as ours.",0
688,"In ""Create Dangerously"", he dealt with the responsibility and the right of artists to their opinion against the backdrop of changing social and political dynamics and pressure -- a discourse that will strike a chord among Indian readers given the campaign against intolerance by many writers in the recent past.",0
688,"Speaking at Sweden's ancient and prestigious Uppsala University in December 1957, a few days after he became the second-youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Camus, noting that writers attract criticism whether they speak or not, stressed they cannot -- and should not -- remain aloof.",0
688,"Beginning in his inimitable style by citing the Oriental wise man's prayer to be spared from living in an exciting era, he quipped that none in the present age was spared as ""our era forces us to take an interest in it"".",0
688,"Going on to show why this obligation of coming out of their comfort zone was necessary, he skilfully sketches out the major issues -- including the purpose of art, the artist's freedom and, especially, the attitude of the state.",0
688,"The speech is also replete with key insights on related matters, including the relation between art and wealth, and of life and social purpose, the media through which forms of art are propagated, representation of life, artistic license, the comparative value of the nation and an individual and more that are still relevant now.",0
688,"In ""Defence of Intelligence"", delivered in March 1945 at a meeting of a group seeking accord and amity in a just-liberated France -- even as the Second World War still raged, Camus made an eloquent plea against violence, hatred and the divisiveness they engendered.",0
688,"Mincing no words at the barbarity they had just endured -- which he noted had also left its mark on the victims, some of whom retaliated in kind at the first chance -- he advocated curing ""poisoned hearts"" by ""saving one's intelligence"".",0
688,"And intelligence here is a sense of reason, discernment and objectivity, not mere mental capability.",1
688,"And finally in ""Bread and Freedom"", delivered at a labour exchange in May 1953, Camus, who was a leftist but never condoned Stalinist excesses, made a blazing attack on totalitarianism.",1
688,"Saying that if some trends continued, one could foresee ""a Europe of concentration camps"", where ""the only people at liberty will be prison guards who will then have to lock up one another"", he sought to nail the pernicious claim that if citizens have their basic, economic needs met, they do not require political liberty.",0
688,"Though speeches delivered decades back but on issues that have again resurfaced due to our inability to learn from history, Camus proves he is a voice beyond his age by his prescient assessment of crucial matters and passionate but well-reasoned arguments.",0
688,Hope we can learn from him now.,0

689,Most of your books are on love.,0
689,I wrote my first book because of a personal tragedy and I walked the path to become an author.,1
689,It was all about recalling memories I shared with my girlfriend who passed away.,0
689,"I would close my eyes, experience that moment; it was emotional but then it helped me heal in a way.",0
689,"But as far as my other works are concerned, I realised that once people enjoy a certain genre that you offer, there is a lot of acceptance you get as an author if you stick with the same.",0
689,"Although predominantly I don’t enjoy writing on the genre ‘romance’, my focus is always on the plot that I choose.",1
689,"For instance, the plot of one of my books was to make a young Indian gain interest in politics and it had to do with the Nirbhaya case.",0
689,"So this is the subject that I want to write about, where I used romance to wrap the story in.",1

689,What inspires you to write each chapter?,0
689,Other authors and poets inspire me to write.,0
689,"I would just be sitting in the morning, sipping my cup of tea, reading a piece of poetry, and all of a sudden I feel inspired by the writing, regardless of the subject and language.",0

689,Do you plan to adapt your books into movies?,0
