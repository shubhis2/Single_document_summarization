19,"CHENNAI: India, already the diabetic capital of the world, is heading towards a diabetic explosion, with 70 million people to be affected by 2015, a decade ahead of expectations",1
19,Fuelling the alarming trend is the rise in diabetes prevalence in rural areas,1
19,"The unexpected surge has forced the Diabetes Atlas, a global report on the disorder, to plan a revision of the India-specific numbers in October",1
19,"���A recent study we did in Chennai and Kancheepuram shows an increase in prevalence of 40% in urban areas in six years, and 49% in rural areas in three years",1
19,"This proves the general hypothesis of diabetes affecting more urbanites than rural people wrong,��� says Indian Diabetes Research Foundation president Dr A Ramachandran",0
19,"According to Diabetes Atlas published in 2007, there are 246 million diabetics across the world, with 80% of them in the developing and underdeveloped countries",0
19,"India, according to these statistics, has 40",1
19,"9 million diabetics, closely followed by China with 39",1
19,8 million diabetics,1
19,"It was predicted that by 2025, India will have 69",0
19,9 million people and China will have 59,0
19,3 million people with diabetics,0
19,"���When the atlas was released, the hypothesis was that the prevalence in cities was higher than in rural areas",0
19,Now it looks like there is a change,0
19,We need to see how many states in India show the same trend,0
19,"That will help us revise the policies and strategies to battle diabetes,��� says Ramachandran, who is to be part of the committee working out the revised data",0
19,"The shift, according to Endocrine Diagnostic Centre and Diabetes Care Centre medical director Dr S Murthy, is possibly because of the urbanisation of rural areas",0
19,"���Changing lifestyles and gentic factors lead to metabolic disorders,��� he says",0
19,"Dr V Mohan, who heads the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, says the country is now at a crossroads and the gap between urban-rural incidence of the disorder is decreasing",0

20,NEW YORK: Don't text while driving as a new study suggests that doing so increases the risk of a crash much more than talking or listening on a mobile phone,1
20,"The Virginia Tech Transportation Institute said texting while driving ""increases the risk of a crash much more than previous studies have concluded with motorists taking their eyes off the road longer than they do when talking or listening on their cell phones",1
20,"""The institute used cameras to continuously observe light vehicle drivers and truckers for more than 6 million miles",1
20,"It found that when drivers of heavy trucks texted, their collision risk was 23 times greater than when not texting, local media reported",1
20,"Dialing a cell phone and using or reaching for an electronic device while driving increased risk of collision about six times in cars and trucks, the study said",1
20,"Recent research using driving simulators suggested that talking and listening were as dangerous as texting, but the ""naturalistic driving studies clearly indicate that this is not the case,"" the local media quoted a release from the institute as saying",1

21,"NEW YORK: A compound in beet plant that gives the vegetable its distinctive red colour may help slow the progression of Alzheimer 's disease, a study claims",1
21,"Researchers at the University of South Florida in the US found that the compound could slow the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain, a process associated with Alzheimer's",1
21,"The discovery could lead to the development of drugs that may alleviate some of the long-term effects of the disease, the world's leading cause of dementia, researchers said",1
21,"""Our data suggest that betanin, a compound in beet extract, shows some promise as an inhibitor of certain chemical reactions in the brain that are involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease,"" said Li-June Ming from University of South Florida",1
21,"""This is just a first step, but we hope that our findings will encourage other scientists to look for structures similar to betanin that could be used to synthesise drugs that could make life a bit easier for those who suffer from this disease,"" said Ming, who presented the research at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society ACS )",1
21,Scientists are still trying to figure out what causes this progressive and irreversible brain disorder,1
21,"However, one prime suspect is beta-amyloid, a sticky protein fragment, or peptide, that accumulates in the brain, disrupting communication between brain cells called neurons",1
21,"Much of this damage occurs, Ming said, when beta-amyloid attaches itself to metals such as iron or copper",1
21,"These metals can cause beta-amyloid peptides to misfold and bind together in clumps that can promote inflammation and oxidation - a process similar to rusting - in nearby neurons, eventually killing them",1
21,Previous research conducted by other scientists suggests that beetroot juice can improve oxygen flow to the ageing brain and possibly improve cognitive performance,1
21,"Ming and colleagues wanted to find out if betanin, a beet compound used in commercial dyes that readily binds to metals, could block the effects of copper on beta-amyloid and, in turn, prevent the misfolding of these peptides and the oxidation of neurons",1
21,"They conducted a series of experiments involving 3,5 di-tert-butylcatechol, or DTBC",1
21,"The scientists measured the oxidative reaction of DTBC when exposed to beta-amyloid only, beta-amyloid bound to copper, and copper-bound beta-amyloid in a mixture containing betanin",1
21,"On its own, beta-amyloid caused little or no oxidation of DTBC, researchers said",1
21,"However, as expected, beta-amyloid bound to copper induced substantial DTBC oxidation",1
21,"When betanin was added to the copper-bound beta-amyloid mixture, the researchers found oxidation dropped by as much as 90 per cent, suggesting that misfolding of the peptides was potentially suppressed",1
22,"LONDON: Malaria infections might be brought under control by managing the eating habits of infected people or animals, as a new study suggests that meal times are an important driver in enabling the disease to thrive",1
22,"According to the study, tests in infected mice found that malaria parasites in the blood timed their daily multiplication rhythms to match when the animals were fed",1
22,"When the mice's mealtime changed, the parasites altered the timing of when they invaded red blood cells, researchers said",1
22,"""We were surprised by how strongly malaria infection responded to changes in the eating times of the mice they were infecting",1
22,"This offers a new avenue for research,"" said lead author of the study, Kimberley Prior from the University of Edinburgh",1
22,"""If we can disrupt the link, it could reduce both the impact and the spread of malaria infection,"" Prior added",1
22,"The study, published in the journal PLOS Pathogens , showed that the parasites' rhythms were linked to daily changes in blood sugar levels in the mice",1
22,"Interfering with the biological pathways that link eating to parasite rhythms -- perhaps through diet, or drugs that manipulate the process -- could reduce both the severity and spread of malaria infection, the researchers said",1
22,"The researchers also studied the timing of parasite rhythms, in multiplication and red blood cell invasion, in groups of malaria-infected mice",1
22,"Changing the feeding times of the animals, by allowing them to eat during the day instead of at night, altered the timing of parasite multiplication from night to day, in line with the mealtime of the mice",1
23,"SYDNEY: Besides helping build strong bones and muscles, Vitamin D may also protect heart tissue and prevent heart failure after a heart attack, finds a study conducted on mice",1
23,Heart failure is a life-threatening condition affecting an estimated 23 million people worldwide,1
23,"Vitamin D prevents excessive scarring and thickening of heart tissue following a heart attack, which may help reduce the risk of heart failure",1
23,"""This is a problem because scarring of heart tissue can reduce the heart's ability to pump blood effectively, which can lead to heart failure,"" said James Chong , Associate Professor at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research in Australia For the study, published in the journal Heart Lung and Circulation, researchers used mouse models to investigate the impact of 1,25D -- a form of Vitamin D that interacts with hormones -- on the cardiac colony-forming unit fibroblasts (cCFU-Fs)cells that form scar tissue after a heart attack",0
23,"Heart attacks occur when blood supply to the heart is blocked, leading to tissue damage",0
23,This triggers an inflammatory response where the cCFU-Fs replace the damaged tissue with collagen-based scar tissue,0
23,"""Our research shows that vitamin D actually blocks the cCFU-Fs from forming scar tissue",1
23,"By blocking cCFU-Fs, vitamin D may play an important role in lowering the risk of heart failure after a heart attack,"" Chong said",1

24,"WASHINGTON: Restoring lipid synthesis could reduce lung fibrosis, a new study has revealed",1
24,"According to a Thomas Jefferson University-study , restoring the lipids that help keep lung tissue flexible and inflated can help slow disease progression in laboratory models of pulmonary fibrosis",1
24,"Pulmonary fibrosis, an ongoing process of scarring that leaves patients chronically short of breath, can progress in severity until the only course of treatment is the lung transplant",1
24,"""This is the first paper to show that rather than being a 'second hit' to help initiate the disease, blocking lipid synthesis alone -- with no other insult to the lungs -- can instigate fibrotic scaring,"" said researcher Ross Summer",0
24,"""This suggests that failure to produce lipids, perhaps because of injury or age-related metabolic changes in lung cells may be an underappreciated process in the development of lung fibrosis, one that may also offer a new and potentially easier path to new treatment of this disease,"" said Dr",0
24,"Romero , the lead author",0
24,"Surfactants or lipids, produced inside the lung tissue, allow airways to inflate and deflate with ease",0
24,"In fact, surfactants are often one of the first treatments given to a premature infant to help ensure the lungs inflate and develop properly",0
24,"In addition, all cells within the lung need lipids as signaling molecules and to build their internal and external membranes",0
24,"But in earlier work, Drs",0
24,"Summer and Romero have shown that when lung tissue is injured - by things like viral infection, particulate inhalation, or other insults - lung cells eventually stop producing lipids in order to conserve energy for other cellular repairs",1
24,"In this study, the teams of Drs",1
24,Summer and Romero used a drug that inhibited lipid production in the lung and showed that this drug alone was capable of instigating lung fibrosis,1
24,"In the converse experiment, the group showed that when increasing lipid production in lungs of animals already injured and developing pulmonary fibrosis, lung scarring could be reduced by 70-80 percent",1
24,Lung fibrosis is thought to also come about when the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the cells of the lung becomes stressed and can no longer properly fold and unfold proteins,1
24,"""We think that the chronic ER stress might ensue because of the inability of cells to produce sufficient lipids to supply their vast amount of ER membranes",1
24,"Without appropriate lipid stores, the ER cannot properly manufacture or remove damaged proteins out of the cell into lysosomes, as a result, damage accumulates in these lung cells leading to irreversible fibrosis"", researchers said",0

25,"The technology, called Smart Sensory Skin (S3), will detect emotional and physical deficiencies in astronauts through wireless sensors that will then send an immediate response to improve the ""atmosphere"", and adjust the astronauts' environment to fit their individual needs",1
25,"The adjustments include changes in temperature, light exposure, light colour, and oxygen levels",1
25,"""It's vital for astronauts to be mentally healthy during missions and right now there's no active, real-time solution to help them when they feel stressed or anxious,"" said Arman Sargolzaei , professor of at FPU",1
25,"""This technology would provide them with immediate relief to their state of mind,"" Sargolzaei added",1
25,"The eventual product will incorporate the wireless sensors into astronaut clothing, so that physicians on Earth can also monitor the person's pulse rate, blood pressure and joint angles",1
25,"Similar technology already exists, but it is cumbersome, often uncomfortable, and data collection is passive",1

29,"""Whilst a small amount of fluoride is good for your teeth and prevents tooth decay, high levels are toxic and can cause crippling deformities that are irreversible,"" said lead researcher Simon Lewis from University of Bath in Britain When water passes over certain minerals, it can dissolve fluoride, which results in elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water sources in parts of India, China, East Africa, and North America",0
29,Levels of fluoride in drinking water are routinely monitored and controlled at treatment works in developed countries,0
29,"However in areas of the world where there is no piped water system or treatment works, people rely on drawing untreated water from wells, which can often be contaminated with higher than recommended levels of fluoride",0

31,Epidermolysis bullosa is the scientific name of a congenital skin disease that is currently considered to be incurable,0
31,Its underlying mechanism is a defect in protein-forming genes that are essential for skin regeneration,0
31,"Even minor stress can result in blisters, wounds, and skin loss with scar formation",0
31,"Depending on disease severity, internal organs may likewise be affected, leading to critical dysfunctions",0

32,"""They are known to be sources of intense X-ray radiation, electromagnetic waves similar to light but having ten to hundred thousand times higher energy, which carries vital clues to understand them as well as the physical processes responsible for the radiation,"" the IUCAA said in a statement",1
32,Astronomers have extensively studied various properties of this radiation to piece together a complete picture of compact objects and their immediate surroundings,1
32,"However, the puzzle often remains incomplete due the missing information about the elusive properties of X-rays known as polarisation",1

33,"The researchers made their discovery by continually monitoring patches of the night sky over many months, and detecting red light from the star with innovative red- sensitive cameras",1
33,They noticed dips in the light from the star every 2,1
33,"6 days, implying that a planet was orbiting and periodically blocking the starlight",1
33,"Using these data, they then tracked the planet's orbit and calculated the size, position and mass of NGTS-1b by measuring the radial velocity of the star",1
33,"In fact, this method, measuring how much the star 'wobbles' due to the gravitational tug from the planet, was the best way of measuring NGTS-1b's size, researchers said",1
34,"NEW YORK: The outskirts of spiral galaxies like our own could be crowded with colliding black holes of massive proportions and a prime location for hunting the sources of gravitational waves, a study led by an Indian origin researcher has found",1
34,Researchers at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the US identified an overlooked region that may be rife with orbiting black holes and the origin of gravitational-wave chirps heard by observatories in the US and Italy,1
34,Identifying the host galaxies of merging massive black holes could help explain how orbiting pairs of black holes form,1
34,"Conditions favourable for blackhole mergers exist in the outer gas disks of big spiral galaxies, according to Sukanya Chakrabarti, assistant professor at RIT and lead author of the study published in Astrophysical Journal Letters",1
34,"Until now, small satellite or dwarf galaxies were thought to have the most suitable environment for hosting blackhole populations: a sparse population of stars, unpolluted with heavy metals like iron, gold and platinum - elements spewed in supernovae explosions - and inefficient winds that leave massive stars intact",1
34,Chakrabarti realised the edges of galaxies like the Milky Wav have similar environments to dwarf galaxies but with a major advantage - big galaxies are easier to find,1
34,"""The metal content in the outer disks of spiral galaxies is also quite low and should be rife with black holes in this large area,"" Chakrabarti said",1
34,"""This study shows that, when predicting or interpreting observations of black holes, we need to account not only for differences between different types of galaxies but also the range of environments that occur inside of them,"" said Richard O'Shaughnessy, assistant professor at RIT and a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration",1
34,A deeper understanding of the universe is possible now that scientists can combine gravitational wave astronomy with traditional measurements of bands of light,1
34,"Existing research shows that even black holes, which are too dense for light to escape, have a gravitational wave and an optical counterpart, remnants of matter from the stellar collapse from which they formed",1
35,BOSTON: Scientists have developed a nutrient cocktail which may slow down cognitive impairment in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease,1
35,"Researchers, including those at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT ) in the US, developed a nutrient cocktail aimed at treating what they consider is ""the root cause"" of Alzheimer's - loss of brain synapses",1
35,"The mixture, Souvenaid, increases production of new synapses and restores connectivity between brain regions, improving memory and other cognitive functions, 'MIT Technology Review' reported",1
35,"Researchers mixed three naturally occurring dietary compounds: choline, uridine, and the omega-3 fatty acid DHA ""All those compounds are taken simultaneously boost production of phosphatides, encouraging membrane development, which is critical in creating new synapses,"" researchers said",1
35,"In the study, published in the journal Lancet Neurology , patients with prodromal Alzheimer's -- the predementia stage of Alzheimer's with mild symptoms -- were given either Souvenaid or a placebo",1
35,"Compared to people who drank the placebo, patients who drank Souvenaid throughout the trial showed less worsening in everyday cognitive and functional performance and significantly less atrophy of the hippocampus, which is caused early in Alzheimer's by brain tissue loss",1
35,"""It feels like science-fiction, where you can take a drink of Souvenaid and you get more synapses for improved cognitive function",1
35,"But it works,"" said Emeritus Richard Wurtman , a professor at MIT",1
36,WASHINGTON: NASA 's Dawn mission to Ceres has found the evidence of residual liquid left over from an ancient global ocean on the dwarf planet,1
36,"The researchers found that Ceres' crust is a mixture of ice, salts and hydrated materials that were subjected to past and possibly recent geologic activity and that this crust represents most of that ocean",1
36,"They suggest that there is a softer, easily deformable layer beneath Ceres' rigid surface crust, which could be the signature of residual liquid",1
36,"""More and more, we are learning that Ceres is a complex, dynamic world that may have hosted a lot of liquid water in the past, and may still have some underground,"" said Julie Castillo-Rogez, Dawn project scientist based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California",1
36,"Researchers led by Anton Ermakov, a postdoctoral researcher at JPL, used shape and gravity data measurements from the Dawn mission to determine the internal structure and composition of Ceres",1
36,"The research supports the possibility that Ceres is geologically active - if not now, then it may have been in the recent past",1
36,"Three craters - Occator, Kerwan and Yalode - and Ceres' solitary tall mountain, Ahuna Mons, are all associated with ""gravity anomalies,"" researchers said",1
36,This means discrepancies between the scientists' models of Ceres' gravity and what Dawn observed in these four locations can be associated with subsurface structures,1
36,Researchers led by Roger Fu at Harvard University in the US investigated the strength and composition of Ceres' crust and deeper interior by studying the dwarf planet's topography,1
36,"By modelling how Ceres' crust flows, Fu and colleagues found it is likely a mixture of ice, salts, rock and an additional component believed to be a clathrate hydrate",1
36,A clathrate hydrate is a cage of water molecules surrounding a gas molecule,1
36,"This structure is 100 to 1,000 times stronger than water ice, despite having nearly the same density",1
36,"The researchers believe Ceres once had more pronounced surface features, but they have smoothed out over time",1
36,"This type of flattening of mountains and valleys requires a high-strength crust resting on a more deformable layer, which Fu and colleagues interpret to contain a little bit of liquid",1
37,"WASHINGTON: Western Asia is the most likely spot where modern humans first encountered and had sexual rendezvous with a different hominid species - the Neanderthals, a study suggests",1
37,"When the ancestors of modern humans migrated out of Africa , they passed through the Middle East and Turkey before heading deeper into Asia and Europe",1
37,"At this important crossroads, it is thought that they encountered and had sexual rendezvous with the Neanderthals",1
37,"Genomic evidence shows that this ancient interbreeding occurred, and Western Asia is the most likely spot where it happened",1
37,"Researchers at the University at Buffalo (UB) in the US explored the legacy of these interspecies trysts, with a focus on Western Asia, where the first relations may have occurred",1
37,"The research, published in the journal Genome Biology and Evolution, analysed the genetic material of people living in the region today, identifying DNA sequences inherited from Neanderthals",1
37,"""As far as human history goes, this area was the stepping stone for the peopling of all of Eurasia,"" said Omer Gokcumen, assistant professor at UB College of Arts and Sciences",0
37,"""This is where humans first settled when they left Africa",1
37,It may be where they first met Neanderthals,0
37,"From the standpoint of genetics, it is a very interesting region,"" said Gokcumen",1
37,Scientists analysed 16 genomes belonging to people of Turkish descent,1
37,"""Within these genomes, the areas where we see relatively common Neanderthal introgression are in genes related to metabolism and immune system responses,"" said Recep Ozgur Taskent, a PhD candidate at UB",0
37,"""Broadly speaking, these are functions that can have an impact on health,"" said Taskent",0
37,"For example, one DNA sequence that originated from Neanderthals includes a genetic variant linked to celiac disease",0
37,Another includes a variant tied to a lowered risk of malaria,0
37,"The relations that our ancestors had with Neanderthals tens of thousands of years ago may continue to exert an influence on our well-being today, Gokcumen said",0
37,"In addition to exploring the specific functions of genetic material that the Turkish population inherited from Neanderthals, the study also examined the Neanderthals' influence on human populations in Western Asia more broadly",0
37,"However, the research shows that people living in this area today have relatively little Neanderthal DNA compared to people in other parts of the world",0
37,"The team analysed genomic data from dozens of Western Asian individuals and observed that, on average, with a few exceptions, these populations carry less Neanderthal DNA than Europeans, Central Asians and East Asians",0
37,"The differences in Neanderthal ancestry between Western Asian and other populations may be due to the region's unique position in human history, Taskent added",0
38,"WASHINGTON: Corals may have developed a preference for consuming plastic bits, putting them at risk of being choked by the indigestible materials, a study has found",0
38,Scientists have long known that marine animals mistakenly eat plastic debris because the tiny bits of floating plastic might look like prey,0
38,The study of plastic ingestion by corals by researchers from Duke University in the US suggests there may be an additional reason for the potentially harmful behaviour,0
38,"Visual cues, such as a resemblance to prey, do not factor into the appeal because corals have no eyes, researchers said",0
38,"""Corals in our experiments ate all types of plastics but preferred unfouled microplastics by a threefold difference over microplastics covered in bacteria,"" said Austin S Allen, a PhD student at Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment",1
38,"""This suggests the plastic itself contains something that makes it tasty,"" said Allen",1
38,"""When plastic comes from the factory, it has hundreds of chemical additives on it",1
38,"Any one of these chemicals or a combination of them could be acting as a stimulant that makes plastic appealing to corals,"" said Alexander C Seymour, from Duke's Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Center",0
38,"Further research will be needed to identify the specific additives that make the plastic so tasty to corals and determine if the same chemicals act as feeding stimulants to other marine species, researchers said",0
38,"Microplastics, tiny pieces of weathered plastic less than five millimetres in diameter, began accumulating in the oceans four decades ago and are now ubiquitous in the marine environment",0
38,"They pose a major threat to foraging sea animals, including many species of birds, turtles, fish, marine mammals and invertebrates",0
38,"Since plastic is largely indigestible, it can lead to intestinal blockages, create a false sense of fullness or reduce energy reserves in animals that consume it",0
38,"""About eight per cent of the plastic that coral polyps in our study ingested was still stuck in their guts after 24 hours,"" said Allen",0
38,"The biological effects of most of these compounds are still unknown, but some, such as phthalates, are confirmed environmental estrogens and androgens - hormones that affect sex determination",0
38,Researchers conducted their two-part study using corals collected from waters off the North Carolina coast,0
38,"In their first experiment, they offered small amounts of eight different types of microplastics to the corals to see if the animals would eat the bite-sized bits versus other similarly-sized items offered to them, such as clean sand",0
38,"""We found that the corals ate all of the plastic types we offered and mostly ignored sand,"" Allen said",1
38,"In the second experiment, they put groups of coral into separate feeding chambers",1
38,Each group was offered the same amount weathered plastics for a 30-minute period,1
38,Some groups got only particles of unfouled microplastics while others got only particles of weathered microplastics fouled with a bacterial biofilm,1
38,"This experiment verified that the corals would eat both types of plastic, but preferred the clean type by a three-to- one margin",1
38,The researchers hope their findings will encourage scientists to explore the role taste plays in determining why marine organisms ingest microplastics,1
39,"LONDON: The brain network involved in daydreaming plays an important role in allowing us to perform routine tasks efficiently, without investing too much time and energy, a study has found",1
39,"Scientists at the University of Cambridge in the UK showed that far from being just 'background activity', the 'default mode network' involved in daydreaming may be essential to helping us perform tasks on autopilot",1
39,"The findings have relevance to brain injury, particularly following traumatic brain injury, where problems with memory and impulsivity can substantially compromise social reintegration",1
39,"They may also have relevance for mental health disorders, such as addiction, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, where particular thought patterns drive repeated behaviours, and the mechanisms of anaesthetic agents and other drugs on the brain",1
39,"Previously, scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine had found that a collection of brain regions appeared to be more active during such states of rest",1
39,This network was named the 'default mode network' (DMN),1
39,"While it has since been linked to, among other things, daydreaming, thinking about the past, planning for the future, and creativity, its precise function is unclear",0
39,"In the new research published in the journal Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, scientists showed that the DMN plays an important role in allowing us to switch to 'autopilot' once we are familiar with a task",0
39,"In the study, 28 volunteers took part in a task while lying inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner",0
39,Functional MRI (fMRI) measures changes in brain oxygen levels as a proxy for neural activity,1
39,Participants were shown four cards and asked to match a target card to one of these cards,1
39,"There were three possible rules - matching by colour, shape or number",1
39,"Volunteers were not told the rule, but rather had to work it out for themselves through trial and error",0
39,The most interesting differences in brain activity occurred when comparing the two stages of the task - acquisition (where the participants were learning the rules by trial and error) and application (where the participants had learned the rule and were now applying it),0
39,"During the acquisition stage, the dorsal attention network, which has been associated with the processing of attention-demanding information, was more active",0
39,"However, in the application stage, where participants utilised learned rules from memory, the DMN was more active",0
39,"In this stage, the stronger the relationship between activity in the DMN and in regions of the brain associated with memory, such as the hippocampus, the faster and more accurately the volunteer was able to perform the task",0
39,"This suggested that during the application stage, the participants could efficiently respond to the task using the rule from memory",0
39,"""Rather than waiting passively for things to happen to us, we are constantly trying to predict the environment around us,"" said Deniz Vatansever , former student at the University of Cambridge",1
39,"""Our evidence suggests it is the default mode network that enables us do this",1
39,"It is essentially like an autopilot that helps us make fast decisions when we know what the rules of the environment are,"" said Vatansever, who is now based at the University of York ""So for example, when you are driving to work in the morning along a familiar route, the default mode network will be active, enabling us to perform our task without having to invest lots of time and energy into every decision,"" he said",1
40,"TORONTO: Consumption of psychedelic drugs such as magic mushrooms or LSD may decrease the likelihood of antisocial criminal behaviour, a study claims",1
40,"Researchers, including those from University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus in Canada , used data obtained from the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health to explore the connection between the use of classic psychedelic substances and criminal behaviour among more than 480,000 adult respondents from the past 13 years",1
40,"The study, published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, found that respondents who have used psychedelic drugs had 27 per cent decreased odds of larceny or theft, and 22 per cent decreased odds of arrest for a violent crime in the past year",1
40,"At the same time, lifetime use of other illicit substances was generally associated with increased odds of criminal behaviour, researchers said",1
40,"""The development of innovative and effective interventions to prevent criminal behaviour is an obvious priority,"" said Peter Hendricks from University of Alabama in the US",1
40,"""Our findings suggest the protective effects of classic psychedelic use are attributable to genuine reductions in antisocial behaviour rather than reflecting improved evasion of arrest,"" he said",1
40,The positive effects associated with classic psychedelic use appear to be reliable,1
40,"Given the costs of criminal behaviour, the potential represented by this treatment paradigm is significant, researchers said",1

44,NEW DELHI: Apple recently launched its iOS 10 operating system for all users having supported iPhone and iPad devices,1
44,"And despite facing some initial glitches, iOS 10’s early adoption rate has been recorded to be higher than that of iOS 9 in the same time frame",1
44,"As recorded by the Mixpanel website, iOS 10 reached 14",1
44,45% of eligible devices in the first 24 hours of its release,1
44,"In comparison, iOS 9 was on 12",1
44,60% of eligible device within 24 hours of it being released for all users,1
44,It is too early to guess when iOS 10 will be on about 50% of all eligible devices,1
44,"As per the website, iOS 8 reached 50% adoption rate in a month, while iOS 9 hit the same spot within 12 days",1
44,"We believe that the adoption rate for iOS 10 would’ve been even faster, had it not encountered the installation-related bugs early during rollout",0
44,"For those unaware, iOS 10 was reported to have caused iPhones and iPads to freeze after they were updated with the latest OS, within hours of its public release",0
44,"Several users took to Twitter and Facebook to vent their ire as downloading the update led them to factory reset their devices, wiping all saved data on devices",0
44,"It was reported that during installation process, the handset showed an error prompting users to plug the device(s) to PC and use iTunes",0
44,"On connecting, another error cropped up which read, ""There is a problem with the iPhone 'iPhone' that requires it to be updated or restored",1
44,"""However, Apple quickly addressed the issue",0
44,“The problem was quickly resolved and we apologize to those customers,0
44,"Anyone who was affected should connect to iTunes to complete the update or contact AppleCare for help,” it said to Recode website",0
45,Gadgets and technology help us in doing nearly everything better and staying fit is no exception,0
45,"Whether you’re a long-term fitness buff or just getting started on the path of getting into shape, a fitness tracker is one of the best gadgets one can get",0
45,"These wrist-worn (generally) devices can not only track human body’s vital signs like heart rate, but also log fitness-related data such as step count, calories burnt, sleep activity and more",0
45,"This data can be then used to create personalized fitness goals and diet plans, thus leading to a healthier lifestyle",0
45,"When it comes to fitness trackers, Fitbit is a name that needs no introduction",0
45,The company recently launched two new products – Charge 2 and Flex 2,0
45,"Of these, the more expensive Charge 2 is an upgrade to the Fitbit Charge HR, which is now almost two years old",1
45,"We tested the Fitbit Charge 2 for a few days, using it for tracking everything from sleeping patterns to daily walks",1
45,"So, is the Fitbit Charge 2 and its promise of a healthier lifestyle any good, especially at an asking price of Rs 14,999? Let’s find out",0
45,Fitbit Charge 2 is essentially comprises two components – tracker module and wrist band,0
45,The wrist band is made from a flexible elastomer material and comes with a stainless-steel buckle for fastening the Charge 2 around the wrist,0
45,"The outer side of the band is textured, while the underside is smooth",0
45,"The wrist band is removable and can be swapped with one of the many designer bands, which have to be purchased separately",0
45,"Since it’s sweat proof, the wrist band doesn’t irritate the skin even when the Charge 2 is worn on the wrist for an extended period of time",0
45,"As for the tracker module itself, its frame is made from stainless steel",0
45,"On the top rests a slightly curved black glass, under which hides a large (at least as compared to the Charge HR) OLED display",0
45,"The left and right sides of the frame are chamfered and a navigation button lies on the left, the only button on the Fitbit Charge 2",0
45,Flip the Charge 2 and you see the optical heart rate tracker with two flashing LEDs (one each at the top and bottom of the tracking chip),0
45,"There are also three charging contacts at the bottom, which work by making contact with the pins on the clip-on charger",0
45,"Other important components include a 3-axis accelerometer, an altimeter and a vibration motor",0
45,"Overall, we found the design and build quality of the Fitbit Charge 2 to be really good",0
45,"While the tracker module is quite solid, the wrist band is flexible yet sturdy enough to withstand daily wear and tear",0
45,"Fitbit Charge 2 comes with a touch-capable OLED screen that automatically turns on when the wearer flicks the wrist, although this functionality can be disabled in the Fitbit app",0
45,The display can also be turned on with a double-tap or by pressing the navigation button on the side,0
45,"Though the display shows time and date by default, users also have the option to choose from the various styles available",0
45,"To change the display style, simply select it from the ‘Clock Display’ option in the Fitbit app and sync the tracker with the app",0
45,The display can be single-tapped repeatedly to flip through daily activity stats like calories burnt and floors climbed,0
45,"As for the navigation, pressing the navigation button on the left repeatedly moves through various menu options (e",0
45,g,0
45,"Heart Rate, Stopwatch)",0
45,"While a menu item is active, its related options can be cycled through by tapping the display",0
45,"Lastly, long-pressing the side navigation button starts/stops the function associated with a menu item (e",0
45,g,0
45,Run),0
45,"Interestingly, on-screen options can also be shuffled through by tapping anywhere on the wristband",0
45,Fitbit Charge 2 works in tandem with the Fitbit app (available on all platforms),0
45,You also need to create a free Fitbit account (if you don’t already have one) to login to the app,0
45,"The account/profile creation includes entering essential body statistics like weight and height, as these are required for setting up personalized meal plans and weight goals",0
45,"Once you login with your Fitbit account, it’s generally easy to pair the Charge 2 with the smartphone over Bluetooth using the app",0
45,"But sometimes, the tracker does take a bit of a trial-and-error to get paired up",0
45,"After pairing, you can simply wear the Charge 2 on the wrist (it can be worn on either of the wrists) and it will start doing its thing",0
45,The tracker syncs with the smartphone over Bluetooth every time the app is launched,0
45,It can be manually synchronized as well,0
45,"Also, the smartphone that Fitbit Charge 2 is paired with needs to be connected to a network so that logged data can be synchronized to your Fitbit account The ‘Dashboard’ is the default landing section of the app",0
45,"It displays a summarized list of all the metrics that are tracked by Fitbit Charge 2, including steps walked, calories burnt, floors climbed and sleep activity",0
45,"Tapping on any logged parameter gives its logged values for the past days, with the last week’s data arranged in the form of a bar graph",0
45,"The primary daily goal is set to steps by default, but can be changed via the tracker settings in the app",0
45,All data logs reset automatically at the start of the next day (00:00 hrs),0
45,"During our extensive testing spanning over the course of almost a week (which included wearing the device almost 24x7), we found the Fitbit Charge 2 to be really good at logging different parameters",0
45,It detects activities like sleeping automatically and heart rate tracking is reliably accurate,0
45,"Moreover, step logging is almost real-time",0
45,Fitbit Charge 2 comes with ‘guided breathing sessions’ (2min or 5min in length) feature,0
45,It lets you practice relaxed breathing by guiding you through inhale and exhale actions,0
45,This is something we liked a lot,0
45,There’s also multi-sport tracking built-in,0
45,"It can track activity when you’re lifting weights, running on the treadmill, cycling or even working out generally",0
45,All this data is then synced to the companion app,0
45,"In our testing, multi-sport tracking worked as expected",0
45,One feature we’d like to talk about is ‘move reminders’,0
45,"To help you stay through the entire day, Fitbit Charge 2 vibrates on an hourly basis, encouraging you to take at least 250 steps (roughly equivalent to a few minutes of walking)",0
45,"Of course, the reminders can be customized from the tracker’s settings in the app",0
45,"Fitbit Charge 2’s ‘connected GPS’ functionality uses the GPS in your smartphone (provided it’s the same the tracker is paired with) to track your route, thus helping in getting real-time statistics like distance travelled",0
45,"During our testing, the feature worked quite well",0
45,"That said, how accurate it is depends on numerous factors such as the quality of GPS satellite lock-in and the connection between the smartphone and tracker",0
45,"If any of your friends uses a Fitbit fitness tracker, you can compare your fitness stats and take part in challenges together",0
45,"However, we weren’t able to test this feature out",1
45,A really useful feature of the Fitbit Charge 2 is smartphone notifications,1
45,"These include alerts about calls, text messages (SMS, WhatsApp and Hangouts) and calendar events",0
45,"In our testing, notifications worked exceptionally well",0
45,"Consequently, we had to check our smartphone less often",0
45,"But even with that, we found the alerts functionality to be limited",0
45,"Competing products like the Garmin vivosmart HR are much better in this regard, offering not only email and social media alerts, but also the ability to control music playback and some other devices",0
45,"Coming to the battery life, we found it to be really good",0
45,"Fitbit claims that the Charge 2 can last up to five days on a single charge and indeed, the battery lasted about four and a half days (even with 24x7 tracking) before needing to be recharged",1
45,The new Fitbit Charge 2 ticks nearly all the right boxes,1
45,"It’s comfortable for wearing all-day, supports real-time tracking of numerous activities and the notification alerts are all good",0
45,"But there are a few negatives too, such as the often inconsistent Bluetooth syncing and the lack of music control functionality",0
45,"At Rs 14,999, we’d say that Fitbit Charge 2 is a pretty solid and well-rounded fitness tracker and definitely recommended",0
45,"For those looking at alternatives, the Garmin vivosmart HR is a great option",0

54,"They might not have traditional income proof but with the power of a smartphone, they are leaving a massive digital footprint,"" says Abhishek Garg, cofounder, Finomena",0
54,"The platform uses this big data to create machine learning-based risk and credit scoring systems that take into account over 20,000 data points to assess the credit worthiness of a borrower",0
54,"Shashank Singh, 26, may be a lawyer at the Delhi High Court, but securing a loan from a bank was nearly impossible",0
54,"""As an advocate, my income fluctuates month to month , which is why banks are reluctant to issue credit cards to me or approve my loan applications,"" he says",0
54,"When he wanted to purchase an iPhone 6S, Singh approached several banks for a loan, but was turned down each time",0
54,He started looking for alternatives and chanced upon Finomena,0
54,"""They had a one-on-one conversation with me about their processes, and sent someone to pick up the documents from my home",0
54,"My loan was approved within a day,"" says Singh",1
54,A credit score is a three digit numeric summary of your entire credit history,1
54,It is prepared based on the information provided in your Credit Information Report,0
54,The credit score normally ranges between 300 and 900,1
54,Most banks and financial institutions rely on this figure to determine the credit worthiness of potential bor rowers,1
54,"In fact, 79% of the loans approved are for individuals with a score over 750",0
54,"However, this is a setback for the young unbanked population since they may not have a credit score at all, resulting in a vicious cycle",0
54,"Finomena's founders, Riddhi Mittal and Abhishek Garg, did extensive research about loan disbursal mechanisms and the demographic of borrowers, which revealed that most banks and NBFCs steer clear of the students and young professionals because traditional modes of KYC data collection don't work for them",0
54,"“Most of our customers are in their first jobs, or self-employed with no traditional proof,“ says Mittal",0
54,"While there are a few options available to customers for buying high-end gadgets on an EMI basis, they often have hidden clauses",0
54,In-store EMI programmes require the customer to have a credit card,1
54,"However, less than 2% Indians are credit card holders",1
54,These schemes also have set tenures and EMI amounts payable by the customer,1
54,Finomena has taken it one step further by introducing FMIs or flexible monthly installments,0
54,"Viren Makwana, an IT student who also has a part-time job, was pleasantly surprised to learn that he could choose the down-payment amount, as well as how much he wanted to pay each month for buying a laptop",0
54,"The 21-year-old settled for a monthly payment of Rs 2,000 to pay off the loan over a 12-month period",0
54,"""Initially I didn't believe that online EMIs were possible, but once I spoke to a Finomena representative, I was reassured that the process would work,"" he says",0

61,"Last week, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) imposed a $21",1
61,17 million fine on Googlefor “search bias” and abuse of its dominant position,1
61,The Commission found that Google through its search design had placed its commercial flight search function at a prominent position on the search results page to the disadvantage of other businesses trying to gain market access,1
61,"I was intrigued by this order because Google is not in the travel business, and I couldn’t understand how its behaviour could be anti-competitive unless it was using its search engine to steal customers away from competitors",0
61,I decided to try things out for myself,0
61,I typed “flight” into the Google’s search box and scrolled through the results page,0
61,"After the obligatory advertisements at the top, I noticed a box with a link to a page called ‘Google Flights’",1
61,"When I clicked on it, I was taken to a new page packed with destination suggestions and best price offers",0
61,It even had a neat interface that allowed me to hover over a spot on the map and find out how much it would cost to fly there,0
61,I realised why this irritated vertical search engines,0
61,But I still couldn’t understand what was anti-competitive about all this,0
61,"After all, if Google was going to use its search prowess to steal customers away, it needs to sell tickets",0
61,"I couldn’t imagine why a global search behemoth, whose business model was designed around a highly efficient but entirely automated ad auction platform, would want to have anything to do with a low-margin, high-touch business such as flight ticketing",0
61,So I decided to find out for myself and book a flight,0
61,"I selected a destination, travel dates and flight options and looked at the options I was given",0
61,The first option was to buy the ticket directly from the airline but every other option pointed me to various vertical search engines — taking me right back to where I started,0
61,I was right,0
61,Google was not in the travel business,0
61,"All it had done was devise a better, more intuitive way to organise search results in order to improve the user experience",0
61,Google Flight is not a new business vertical that books your tickets for you,1
61,All it does is offer a price comparison accessible directly from the search page of all available flights to a given destination,1
61,This is exactly the sort of innovation that Internet companies should be encouraged to do: finding new ways to improve their offerings as long as they do not adversely affect the interests of customers or competitors,0
61,I can’t see what is anti-competitive about that,0
61,"After all, any customer who wants to book a flight from among the search results served up on the Google Flight page has to do so from the vertical search engines that were

complaining that they were being sidelined",0
61,"It’s disappointing that CCI, which took such a progressive view in the recent Ola case, did not apply the same rationale to address these nuances in the Google decision",0
61,"Competition laws may have been designed for the offline world but when we use it to regulate large online players, it is imperative that we reorient our thinking so that we can better address the challenges of the big data age",0
61,"Today, customers benefit from network effects",0
61,The larger an Internet company grows the better it can serve its customers by leveraging data at scale to offer features and services that are otherwise impossible to achieve,0
61,"If competition law is to be deployed to the benefit of the end consumer, we must allow Internet companies to better leverage the advantages of scale",0
61,High market share and dominance are no longer antitrust concerns,0
61,What is important is the conduct of a dominant market player and whether it is using its dominance to stifle innovation and/or competition,0
61,"The dissenting opinion in the Google case seems to have held this view: they accused the majority of having “…woven a narrative of hypothetical anti–competitive foreclosure”, referring to the extent to which the majority opinion has been based on the anticipation of harm without any evidence to that effect",0
61,It is unfortunate for the evolution of Indian competition jurisprudence that they could not persuade the majority,0
61,"Rahul Matthan is Partner, Trilegal

The views expressed are personal",0
62,"On Tuesday, the world’s most powerful rocket ever was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States",1
62,"SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy was successfully tested on its first attempt, an achievement that is important for two reasons: One, Falcon Heavy, which is essentially an assembling of three Falcon 9s (SpaceX’s workhorse), is now way ahead — and by ahead, really ahead — of competition in the so-called heavy-lift category",1
62,"It can place about 64 tonnes payload, which is more than twice the payload of its nearest competitor ULA’s Delta 4 Heavy, in a single launch into the Lower Earth Orbit (LEO)",0
62,The scientific and commercial windows this opens are many,0
62,"It will enable the launch of heavier payloads, encourage the private sector to participate in space-related missions, and also, as seen across social media, get planetary scientists discussing its impact",0
62,"Simply put, Falcon Heavy is a game changer in the space race",1
62,"Second, SpaceX , a company promoted by Elon Musk, has shown that it can not only easily reach the LEO (and go beyond), but has also done this using reusable boosters which will drastically cut the costs of launching satellites",0
62,"At an estimate of about $90 million per launch, it already costs only about a fourth the current rate for launches in that payload category",0
62,It’s not that the launch was a complete success,0
62,There were a few hiccups,0
62,"Mr Musk’s Tesla Roadster, the mock payload on Falcon Heavy, which was supposed to revolve around the Sun at a distance of the Mars’ orbit, has overshot its trajectory and is now in the asteroid belt, between Mars and Jupiter and precariously close to the Ceres’ orbit",0
62,"The second hiccup — one which should be bothering Mr Musk more — is the failure of the main booster to dock on the drone ship, showing that the rocket’s ocean-borne landing is yet to be perfected",0
62,"With Tuesday’s launch, Mr Musk proved that he is not only an entrepreneur, but also a great public relations tactician (and, of course, fan-boy par excellence)",1
62,"The Roadster can be seen as space junk, because except for its novelty factor, there’s no scientific or academic purpose for sending an automobile into space",0
62,"Adding to this is the fact that the mannequin in the driver’s seat is wearing a SpaceX spacesuit, and David Bowie’s Space Oddity is playing in endless loop on the radio in the car, and the glove compartment has a copy of Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy",0
62,"The car’s dashboard also has a message that says “Don’t Panic”, the enduring tenet of the Hitchhiker books",0
62,"As Mr Musk said: “It’s kind of silly and fun, but silly and fun things are important",1
62,”,1
63,We were warned,0
63,"The venture capitalist and Netscape founder Marc Andreessen wrote a widely read essay in 2011 entitled, “Why Software Is Eating the World",0
63,” But we didn’t take Andreessen seriously  we thought it was only a metaphor,0
63,Now we face the challenge of extracting the world from the jaws of Internet platform monopolies,1
63,I used to be a technology optimist,0
63,"During a 35-year career investing in the best and brightest of Silicon Valley, I was lucky enough to be part of the personal computer, mobile communications, Internet, and social networking industries",0
63,"Among the highlights of my career were early investments in Google and Amazon, and being a mentor to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg from 2006 to 2010",0
63,Each new wave of technology increased productivity and access to knowledge,0
63,Each new platform was easier to use and more convenient,0
63,Technology powered globalisation and economic growth,0
63,"For decades, it made the world a better place",0
63,We assumed it always would,0
63,"Then came 2016, when the Internet revealed two dark sides",0
63,One is related to individual users,0
63,"Smartphones with LTE mobile infrastructure created the first content-delivery platform that was available every waking moment, transforming the technology industry and the lives of two billion users",0
63,"With little or no regulatory supervision in most of the world, companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, and Tencent used techniques common in propaganda and casino gambling, such as constant notifications and variable rewards, to foster psychological addiction",0
63,The other dark side is geopolitical,0
63,"In the United States, Western Europe, and Asia, Internet platforms, especially Facebook, enable the powerful to inflict harm on the powerless in politics, foreign policy, and commerce",0
63,Elections across Europe and in the US have repeatedly demonstrated that automated social networks can be exploited to undermine democracy,0
63,The Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016 also revealed that Facebook provides significant relative advantages to negative messages over positive ones,0
63,"Authoritarian governments can use Facebook to promote public support for repressive policies, as may be occurring now in Myanmar, Cambodia, the Philippines, and elsewhere",0
63,"In some cases, Facebook actually provides support to such governments, as it does to all large clients",0
63,"I am confident that the founders of Facebook, Google, and other major Internet platforms did not intend to cause harm when they adopted their business models",1
63,"They were young entrepreneurs, hungry for success",0
63,"They spent years building huge audiences by reorganising the online world around a set of applications that were more personalised, convenient, and easier to use than their predecessors",0
63,And they made no attempt to monetise their efforts until long after users were hooked,0

67,"1) Customizing and managing your Chrome profiles

One of the most useful features about using Chrome is that you can create your own login and profile so that Chrome can store information such as browsing history, bookmarks etc",0
67,"However, did you know you can create multiple profiles? For example, you can have a work profile to use Chrome while in office",0

68,The much-awaited iPhone X is finally here,0
68,"The smartphone that marks 10th anniversary of the iPhone comes with unique design, edge-to-edge screen and customised version of iOS",0
68,"The most critical change, however, is the inclusion of Face ID, which replaces the fingerprint scanner-based Touch ID",0
68,"So, you might be wondering how does one get used to Face ID? How does it work? Is it convenient and safe? Well, we have been using the iPhone X for last few days here’s how Apple’s futuristic Face ID works",0
68,"What’s Face ID?

Let’s begin with a very basic question",0
68,"After all, what is Face ID? Well, it’s essentially a new technique of authenticating user profile to log into the smartphone",0
68,"While Touch ID scanned your fingerprint, Face ID, as the name implies, scans your face in 360-degree for a 3D map",1
68,"Technology behind Face ID

Apple has a dedicated setup of sensors, called TrueDepth camera, which facilitate Face ID",0
68,"These sensors including infrared camera, dot projector, front camera and flood illuminator, are placed on the front-notch on the iPhone X",0
68,The TrueDepth camera uses infrared wavelength (invisible to the naked eye) to accurately capture your facial details,0
68,This allows the camera to unlock your phone even in low light and dark conditions,0
68,"“The TrueDepth camera captures accurate face data by projecting and analyzing over 30,000 invisible dots to create a depth map of your face and also captures an infrared image of your face,” Apple explains on its website",0
68,“A portion of the A11 Bionic chip’s neural engine — protected within the Secure Enclave — transforms the depth map and infrared image into a mathematical representation and compares that representation to the enrolled facial data,0
68,"”

How to Set up Face ID?

Setting up Face ID on the iPhone X is a bit awkward",0
68,"Before beginning the setup, ensure the front camera lens isn’t covered or there’s any obstruction between your face and the front camera",0
68,"The distance between the phone and your face ideally should be about a feet, though Apple says Face ID works best when the device is about an arm’s length or closer",0
68,"Step 1: To get started, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode (Ensure you’ve already created a passcode for the phone or create one)

Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID and place the phone in front of your face",0
68,You will see a circular frame on the screen,0
68,Step 3: Move/adjust your position to fit in that circular frame,0
68,Step 4: Slowly move your head in clockwise direction,0
68,Step 5: Repeat the process for the final verification,0
68,"Once the set up is complete, tap Done",0
68,"What things can you do with Face ID?

Besides logging into your iPhone X, you can Face ID to authenticate downloads on iTunes and App Store, pretty much everything that Touch ID does",0
68,You can also use Face ID to autofill usernames and passwords for compatible websites in Safari,0
68,You can also sign in to app using this feature,0
68,"Face ID is also compatible with Apple Pay, though this feature is not available in India",0
68,Unlock your phone with just a glance,0
68,"(Apple)

Face ID and user privacy

Apple gives a lot of importance to user privacy",0
68,"For Face ID, the company says the data collected by facial identification method is encrypted and “never leaves your device and is never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else",1
68,” Apple adds that the apps cannot access Face ID data associated with the registered face,1
68,"“Within supported apps, you can enable Face ID for authentication",0
68,Apps are only notified as to whether the authentication is successful,0
68,Users have control over how to use Face ID,0
68,One can disable Face ID by opening Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Use Face ID for and disable iPhone unlock,1
68,You can also disable Face ID for other functionalities,0
68,"Is it convenient?

Getting used to Face ID takes a bit of time, but not that long as you’d expect",0
68,"Unlike the iris scanner on the Galaxy Note 8, Face ID doesn’t fire your front camera on the screen",0
68,Everything that Face ID does is invisible to the human eye,0
68,"Also, it doesn’t really compel you to hold your phone in front of your face all the times; rather it focuses on your attention (Attention-aware in Applespeak)",0
68,The good thing is that it works from almost all angles and unlocks the phone with ease,0
68,It works even if you are wearing glasses or changed your look a bit,0
68,"There’s a minute bit of struggle when using in low light, but works properly nonetheless",0

76,"Researchers found that living abroad increases “self-concept clarity,” the extent to which individuals’ beliefs about themselves are clearly and confidently defined and consistent and stable over time",0
76,"They conducted six studies involving 1,874 participants from online panels and international MBA programmes, who then completed surveys on living abroad",1
76,Researchers from Columbia University and Rice University in the US found living abroad triggers self-discerning reflections in which people grapple with different cultural values and norms of their home and host cultures,0
76,"These reflections are helpful in discovering which values and norms define who people are and which simply reflect their cultural upbringing, according to the study",0
76,The study found that depth (the length of time lived abroad) rather than breadth (the number of countries lived in) enhances a clear sense of self,1

77,"Praise may motivate young adults with autism to exercise more, according to a study",1
77,The research from the UNC Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute (FPG) also found that praising people with autism by pre-recorded messages through iPhones and iPods shows promise for producing more exercise,0
77,"“As people with autism age, they tend to exercise less and less than their peers without autism,” said FPG’s Melissa N",0
77,"Savage, who headed the study",0
77,"“Previous studies have shown that individuals with autism are at special risk for health challenges like obesity, as well as for secondary conditions like depression and diabetes",0
77,"”

Savage said that in addition to health benefits that regular physical activity carries for everyone, it also can be especially powerful for people with autism",0
77,"“Prior research has demonstrated that regular moderate-to-vigorous exercise for people with autism can increase their academic engagement in the classroom,” she explained",0
77,“They tend to spend more time on task and display fewer challenging behaviours,0
77,"”

Due to the benefits of regular physical activity for people with autism, Savage wanted to explore how to increase their engagement in a regular exercise routine through positive reinforcement, a well-established practice for use with people with autism",0
77,"“With technology use in physical activity becoming more commonplace, it was important to determine its advantages or disadvantages to provide needed support,” Savage said",0
77,“We wanted to know under which condition participants would engage in more aerobic activity and which condition they preferred,0
77,"”

For this small single-subject design study, she implemented an exercise program for three young adults with autism, ages 20-22, and followed their daily progress through multiple sessions under different conditions",0
77,"While participants were running laps around cones, they heard the same voice either in-person or through headphones on a fixed schedule, delivering various praise statements, such as “Good job running around the cones!” or “You are doing a great job running Mason!” These praise statements incorporated the target behavior (running), which the autism team’s AFIRM online instruction highlights as an important feature of effective reinforcement",0
77,"“We found that introducing praise statements corresponded with more physical activity for all participants,” Savage said",1
77,"“The number of laps increased for all of them, regardless of whether they received praise in person or through technology",0
77,"”

According to Savage, though, the impact of praise on exercise may not have been the most important finding",0
77,"“When it comes to motivating young adults with autism to exercise, part of the solution may lie in making use of technology,” she said",0
77,“Participants who excelled when hearing praise statements through technology also maintained their performances even when we thinned out the praise statements and generalized the exercise to a new setting,1
77,"”

Savage also said that using technology has several additional advantages",0
77,"Especially among young adults, cell phones and iPods are popular and carry no stigma",0
77,Using them for support may also help people with autism feel more independent,0
77,Relying on technology to deliver praise statements or provide other support also saves time,1
77,"“In-person praise required much more attention to the participant during intervention, and it was harder to be consistent with the time-based schedule,” she said",0
77,"“Using the mobile devices required about 5 minutes to record and upload the praise statements, but there wasn’t any additional work needed once that was done",1

Scientists are still trying to figure out what causes this progressive and irreversible brain disorder",0
78,"However, one prime suspect is beta-amyloid, a sticky protein fragment, or peptide, that accumulates in the brain, disrupting communication between brain cells called neurons",0
78,"Much of this damage occurs, Ming said, when beta-amyloid attaches itself to metals such as iron or copper",0
78,"These metals can cause beta-amyloid peptides to misfold and bind together in clumps that can promote inflammation and oxidation - a process similar to rusting - in nearby neurons, eventually killing them",0
78,Previous research conducted by other scientists suggests that beetroot juice can improve oxygen flow to the ageing brain and possibly improve cognitive performance,1
78,"Ming and colleagues wanted to find out if betanin, a beet compound used in commercial dyes that readily binds to metals, could block the effects of copper on beta-amyloid and, in turn, prevent the misfolding of these peptides and the oxidation of neurons",0
78,"They conducted a series of experiments involving 3,5 di-tert-butylcatechol, or DTBC",0
78,"The scientists measured the oxidative reaction of DTBC when exposed to beta-amyloid only, beta-amyloid bound to copper, and copper-bound beta-amyloid in a mixture containing betanin",0
78,"On its own, beta-amyloid caused little or no oxidation of DTBC, researchers said",1
78,"However, as expected, beta-amyloid bound to copper induced substantial DTBC oxidation",1
78,"When betanin was added to the copper-bound beta-amyloid mixture, the researchers found oxidation dropped by as much as 90 per cent, suggesting that misfolding of the peptides was potentially suppressed",0

79,"But taste preferences influence dietary choices, and some earlier studies have suggested that obese people often taste flavours with less intensity than lean people",0
79,"Dando’s team took a closer look at taste buds, those clusters of cells on the tongue that help perceive the five tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami",0
79,"They turned to lab mice, feeding them a high-fat diet that caused rapid weight gain — and then counting the taste buds in a spot on the tongue that’s normally packed with them",0
79,"The obese mice wound up with 25% fewer taste buds than lean mice that were fed a normal diet, the researchers reported in the journal PLOS Biology",1
79,"Taste buds constantly regenerate as the 50 to 100 cells inside them mature, die off and are replaced by new ones",0
79,"Taste bud cells have an average lifespan of about 10 days, and turnover of the entire taste bud takes about four weeks, explained Dando, who directs the Cornell Sensory Evaluation Facility",1
79,"Both sides of that cycle were affected in the obese mice, as regular cell death sped up and resupply dropped",1
79,"Could fatty food be responsible? No, the researchers found mice genetically resistant to obesity chowed down yet didn’t lose taste buds",0
79,The remaining suspect: the chronic inflammation that obesity triggers throughout the body,0
79,Dando’s team examined a common inflammatory molecule called TNF-alpha,0
79,Mice bred to be genetically incapable of making that molecule got fat but also didn’t lose taste buds,0

82,"Whether it’s the joy in little things or the prosperity at achieving certain aspects in your life, it is difficult to put a quantum to the happiness",1
82,"Here are some secrets to achieve that complacent happiness which we all aim for but are not sure how to achieve:

- Identify ‘whatever floats your boat’

The biggest task is to figure out how is the concept of happiness perceived in your mind",0
82,Happiness doesn’t mean being cheerful and chirpy all the time,0
82,“Don’t focus on ‘happiness’,0
82,"Most of us won’t ever feel constantly ‘happy’ in the way that we are traditionally sold the idea - rather, chase ‘wholeness’,” said Laura Jane Williams, author of ‘Ice Cream for Breakfast’, as quoted by The Independent",0
82,"“Wholeness is to know that life is a million shades of grey - contentedness, sadness, ecstasy, melancholy - and that they all count",0
82,"All of our emotions matter, not just the ‘good’ ones",0
82,"”

- Connecting is the key

While being able to enjoy your own company is great, cherishing human connection is vital to happiness too",0
82,"- Break your way

Moving at a rapid pace to cope up with life has taken over everyone’s mind, which in turn has blocked the path to happiness",0
82,Break your way should be the mantra in such situations - Taking a pause once in a while and having an introspective look at your self is something which is required for a healthy contentment in life,0
82,"- Love your body

Even though it comes as no brainer but exercising and loving your body can do wonders for your mood and building up your self-worth",0
82,"Instead of just focusing on your physical appearance, nutritionist Farah Fonseca, titled England’s Strongest Woman twice, said, “Exercise can be fabulous for your mental health and happiness as well",0
82,"Exercise builds more than muscle - it also boosts self-confidence, mental agility and a ‘can-do’ attitude",0
82,"”

- Focusing on yourself

We all have a tendency to compare ourselves to others, which inevitably fosters feelings of ineptitude and low self-esteem",0
82,"However, once you stop caring about what other people thing about you will transform your life for good",0
82,"- Being helpful

Lending a helping hand to someone in need or simply acting in a more thoughtful manner will create a positive atmosphere that all can benefit from, whether you’re the giver or the receiver",0
82,You never know how much of an impact a small act of kindness can do,0

83,"However, reportedly, Kendall Jenner ran into complications after an IV drip session — held just before the Oscar night — went awry",1
83,This has made everyone sit up and question not only the safety of these procedures but also their validity,0
83,"How it all began

The trend began after a “collateral effect” experienced by patients who were being treated for liver failure",0
83,"Dr Rinky Kapoor, dermatologist and skin laser specialist, SL Raheja Fortis Hospital, Mahim, explains, “Those patients who were injected with high doses of the master antioxidants, in particular, glutathione and vitamin C, exhibited changes in the skin",0

Several injectable combinations of antioxidants and vitamins are now doing the rounds in the market, in any and every dose",0
83,All experts agree that none of them were approved by FDA to this date for aesthetic purposes,0
83,"Ideal cause for an IV drip

Drips are recommended if the benefits outweigh the risks in case of limited options in treating a skin problem, or in cases of genuine deficiency",0
83,"When and if medically required, it is an efficient way to hydrate patients and administer essential nutrients",0
83,"According to Dr Saurabh Shah, dermatologist, Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, mostly IV drip is given to patients who have “acute and chronic illness”, those low on minerals and nutrients, and have chronic fatigue syndrome",1
83,"Dr Sujit Shanshanwal, dermatologist, Apollo Clinic, echoes the same thoughts",0
83,"He says, “Vitamin drips should ideally be used when there is a need for it and it would be best assessed by testing the blood levels of the suspected deficiencies and then supplementing them as needed",0

The fad of ‘gluta’ shots

A popular trend these days is the glutathione drip aka gluta shots",0
83,Glutathione is supposed to be the mother of all antioxidants and gives the skin a glow,0
83,"Therefore, almost all the celebrities opt for this drip",0
83,"“This is FDA approved for patients with liver diseases and hence a controversial topic (for beauty treatments),” says Dr Shah, adding, “There are cases of thrombophlebitis at the site of injection especially in men and women who are smokers and alcoholic",0

Famous fake promises

Most people in metro cities are fatigued and ill-nourished due to their erratic lifestyle and eating habits",0
83,The fact that an intravenous replacement can cure this instantly is catchy for those running against the clock,0
83,"Therefore, they opt for this quick-fix instead of investing long-term in diet and exercise",0
83,"“Words like detoxifying, skin glow, instant rejuvenation, immune boost, etc",0
83,are immensely attractive,0
83,"Anything that promises these is taken up by the masses without giving it a second thought about the genuineness of the product, and the science backing the results",0
83,"Sellers ar making the most of this human instinct,” says Dr Kapoor",0
83,"She further adds, “One must especially beware of medical spas and quacks offering intravenous therapies in ‘hangover clinics’, where promised immediate relief from the symptoms of a hangover (tiredness, headache, nausea) and hooked up to a drip of fluids and medication, with the idea of immediate recovery",0
83,A cocktail of vitamins like this can risk reaching toxic levels,0
83,"”

As per Dr Kiran Naik, plastic and cosmetic surgeon, Global Hospitals, Parel, following are the probable side effects of IV drips for aesthetic purposes:

Bruising, infection and painful swelling at the IV site

Excessive vitamin B can cause liver damage

Glutathione can cause patchy skin

With multiple drugs in the same IV, there can be drug interactions

Rarely, may cause a life-threatening allergic condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome",0
83,"The takeaway

The human body has a systematic way of functioning",0
83,"When it receives a high amount of vitamins or minerals in a single dose, it filters out the majority of them via kidneys or liver",0
83,That is because they can’t be stored in the body for use at a later time,0
83,"So unless one has a medical deficiency, it logically does not justify the fact that these IV drips are beneficial",1
83,“The benefits being observed by those propagating it or receiving it may be peer-driven or psychological,0
83,"There are studies going on across the world on some of these molecules, and until a documented, placebo-controlled, proven study establishes the results and side effects scientifically, they are being taken at the patient’s own risk,” says Dr Kapoor",0

85,"This arm of the study was called a dual “clamp” because it stopped the body’s production of these two hormones and then gave them a fixed amount of the hormones, thus clamping levels in a normal hormonal balance, he said",0
85,"In another set of experiments, the men received inactive placebos that matched the medications",0
85,"The order of when they received the clamp and the placebo was random, with a two-week interval between the study conditions",0
85,"The morning after the first and last nights of each part of the study, all men took the oral glucose tolerance test, in which they gave blood samples while fasting and again after drinking a sugary drink",0

85,"After sleep restriction, this index reportedly showed greater insulin resistance with both the clamp and the placebo",0
85,"However, Liu said this increase was significantly dampened, or less severe, with the dual-clamp, demonstrating that testosterone and cortisol reduced the negative effects of sustained sleep restriction on insulin resistance",0

98,Past research shows that sleep loss reduces a man's testosterone levels and increases cortisol levels,1
98,Liu and his fellow researchers conducted five nights of sleep studies in 34 healthy men with an average age of 33,1
98,"They controlled what the subjects ate and how much they slept, giving them 10 hours of sleep the first night and restricting them to four hours of sleep the remaining nights",0
98,"In this ""crossover"" study, the men served as their own controls",0
98,"In one series of sleep studies, they received three medications: ketoconazole, which switches off the body's production of testosterone and cortisol; testosterone gel; and oral hydrocortisone, a synthetic form of cortisol",0
98,"The doses of testosterone and hydrocortisone were in the midrange of levels that the body normally produces, according to Liu",0
98,"This arm of the study was called a dual ""clamp"" because it stopped the body's production of these two hormones and then gave them a fixed amount of the hormones, thus clamping levels in a normal hormonal balance, he said",0
98,"In another set of experiments, the men received inactive placebos that matched the medications",0
98,"The order of when they received the clamp and the placebo was random, with a two-week interval between the study conditions",0
98,"The morning after the first and last nights of each part of the study, all men took the oral glucose tolerance test, in which they gave blood samples while fasting and again after drinking a sugary drink",0
98,"This test result allowed the researchers to calculate each man's insulin resistance using standard measures, including the Matsuda Index",1
98,"After sleep restriction, this index reportedly showed greater insulin resistance with both the clamp and the placebo",1
98,"However, Liu said this increase was significantly dampened, or less severe, with the dual-clamp, demonstrating that testosterone and cortisol reduced the negative effects of sustained sleep restriction on insulin resistance",0

99,"WASHINGTON DC: In patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, a meal schedule that includes a high-energy breakfast promotes weight loss, improves diabetes and decreases the need for insulin, according to a recent study",0
99,"""This study shows that, in obese insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients, a diet with three meals per day, consisting of a big breakfast, average lunch and small dinner, had many rapid and positive effects compared to the traditional diet with six small meals evenly distributed throughout the day: better weight loss, less hunger and better diabetes control while using less insulin,"" said lead author Daniela Jakubowicz of the Tel Aviv University",0
99,"""The hour of the day--when you eat and how frequently you eat--is more important than what you eat and how many calories you eat,"" she noted",0

Jakubowicz and her colleagues studied 11 women and 18 men who had obesity and type 2 diabetes, being treated with insulin and averaged 69 years of age",0
99,"The patients were randomly assigned to consume one of two different weight-loss diets, which contained an equal number of daily calories, for three months",0
99,"One group (Bdiet) ate three meals: a large breakfast, a medium-sized lunch and a small dinner",1
99,"The second group (6Mdiet) ate the traditional diet for diabetes and weight loss: six small meals evenly spaced throughout the day, including three snacks",0
99,"Overall glucose levels and glucose spikes were measured for 14 days at baseline, during the first two weeks on diet, and at the end of the study by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)",0
99,Glucose levels were tested every two weeks and insulin dosage was adjusted as needed,0
99,"At three months, while the Bdiet group lost 5 kilograms (11 pounds) the 6Mdiet group gained 1",1
99,4 kg (3 lb),1
99,Fasting glucose levels decreased 54 mg/dl (from 161 to 107) in the Bdiet group but only 23 mg/dl (from 164 to 141) in the 6Mdiet group,0
99,Overall mean glucose levels dropped in the first 14 days by 29 mg/dl (from 167 to 138 mg/dl) and 38 mg/dl (from 167 to 129 mg/dl) after three months in the Bdiet group,0
99,Overall mean glucose levels dropped only 9 mg/dl (from 171 to 162 mg/dl) in the first 14 days and only 17 mg/dl (from 171 to 154 mg/dl) in the 6Mdiet group,0
99,"Mean glucose levels during sleep dropped only in the Bdiet group, by 24 mg/dl (from 131 to 107), but not in the 6Mdiet group",0
99,The Bdiet group needed significantly less insulin (-20,0
99,"5 units/day, from 54",0
99,7 to 34,0

99,"2 units/day, from 67",0

99,Carbohydrate craving and hunger decreased significantly in Bdiet group but increased in the 6Mdiet group,1
99,"Importantly, the researchers found a significant reduction of overall glycemia after as little as 14 days on Bdiet, when the participant had almost the same weight as at baseline",0
99,"This finding suggests that even before weight loss, the change in the meal timing itself has a quick beneficial effect on glucose balance that is further improved by the important weight loss found in the 3M diet",1

100,Early puberty may lead to increased risk of diabetes or reproductive problems later in life,1
100,"""Formula feeding is well known to increase the risk of obesity in children",0
100,"Our findings suggest, however, that when breastfeeding mothers do not eat a moderate and healthy diet, there can also be increased risks of various health problems in the offspring, including obesity, diabetes, advanced puberty and reduced fertility,"" said lead researcher Mengjie Wang of the University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences in Toledo, Ohio",0
100,"""This idea must be tested in humans to know whether it applies to our species",0

Wang noted that all over the world, puberty is starting earlier than it did in the past",0
100,"""Childhood obesity, a common health issue, is one of the risk factors for early puberty,"" she said",0
100,"""Previous evidence from animals has revealed that post-weaning overeating advances the timing of puberty, but we lack knowledge of how nutrition before weaning influences metabolism and reproduction",0
100,"""

To determine how excess body weight alters the timing of puberty, Wang gave mice a high-fat-diet from the date they gave birth and started breastfeeding until they weaned their pups",0
100,A second group of new mother mice was given a regular diet for the same amount of time,0
100,Wang found that overfeeding the mothers during breastfeeding can cause obesity in the pups and significantly advance the start of their puberty,1
100,"""These results show that the breast-feeding phase is a critical window that influences when puberty happens,"" Wang said",0
100,"Fertility tests of the mice in adulthood showed that those whose mothers had been fed a high-fat diet while breastfeeding had decreased litter size, longer duration from mating to date of birth and impaired pregnancy rate in both female and male mice",0
100,The researchers also found these mice suffered from glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity--signs of an increased risk of developing diabetes during adulthood,0
100,"""Our results reinforce the findings of previous studies that childhood obesity causes advanced puberty and metabolic disorders in adulthood,"" Wang said",0

102,"LONDON: If you thought it might be possible to be overweight or obese but not at increased risk of heart disease, think again! A new study of nearly 300,000 people has found that unhealthy weight gain can raise risk of heart attacks, strokes and high blood pressure",1
102,"The risk of heart and blood vessel problems increases as body mass index (BMI) increases beyond 22-23 kg per square metre, said the study published in the European Heart Journal",1
102,"Furthermore, the findings showed that the risk also increases steadily the more fat a person carries around their waist",0
102,"""By maintaining a healthy BMI of around 22-23 kg per square metre, healthy people can minimise their risk of developing or dying from heart disease,"" said lead researcher Stamatina Iliodromiti from University of Glasgow in Britain",1
102,"Although it is already known that being overweight or obese increases a person's risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as other diseases such as cancer, there have also been studies that have suggested otherwise",0

103,"With this comes an almost unrealistic expectation or aspiration of how one should look, which is fuelling the prevalence of eating disorders which is dismissed by many",1
103,"While the prevalence of eating disorders in India is lower than that of western countries it appears to be increasing, according to experts",1
103,"An eating disorder is defined as a persistent disturbance of eating behaviour or behaviour intended to control weight, which significantly impairs physical health or psychosocial functioning, often turning out to be a chronic psychiatric condition",0
103,"They tend to be emotional disorders that focus on food, but are actually attempts to deal with perfectionism and a desire to gain control by strictly regulating food and weight, experts said",0
103,"The common types of eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder",0
103,"Treatment for these kinds of disorders has to be a multi-pronged approach, experts said",0
103,"“Dietary treatment alone will not help without counselling as it is a psychological problem,” said Raj",0
103,"“When someone has anorexia nervosa, there are a number of other issues that they face like dental issues, acidity, chronic sore throat and so on",0
103,"In order to treat such a patient, it is imperative to have a good general physician who can help with sorting out the medical issues, a trained psychologist or counsellor who can help in bringing in a positive outlook on body image and a dietician who can educate the patient on the importance of a balanced diet",0
103,"”

Psychological counsellor Sneha Hindocha concurred with Raj’s view",0
103,She stressed the importance of a holistic approach to the treatment process and said acceptance of the issue is the first step towards treatment,0
103,"“When it comes to body image issues, the only way a patient can get better is if they accept and believe that they are okay with the way their bodies are,” said Hindocha",0
103,"“Counselling is a powerful tool that can help such patients but when it comes to severe cases, medication is a must, especially in severe anorexia cases where the patient has lost a lot of weight as it can be life-threatening",0
103,The support of family and friends is essential in these cases as they play a bigger role than the counsellor,0
103,Sensitising them to the needs of the patients is crucial,0
103,"”

Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterised by excessive restriction on food intake and irrational fear of gaining weight, often accompanied by a distorted body self-perception, explained a report published in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine in April, 2015",0
103,"It is clinically diagnosed more frequently in females, with type and severity varying with each case",0
103,"While the cases of anorexia nervosa are reported greatly in the grey literatures of the western countries, the number of clinical cases in India is on the rise, the report said",0
103,The age of onset for most cases ranges between 12 to 20 years and most cases are brought to clinical attention only when there are severe somatic complaints,0
103,"In developing countries like India, severe anorexia is not commonly reported",0
103,"“The body gets its energy from carbohydrates, proteins and fats,” said dietician Dr Preethi Raj",0
103,"“In the case of anorexia, the patient generally restricts carbohydrates which is very harmful as in the case of adolescents and young adults, carbohydrates should constitute 45-65% of the total calories",0
103,Not having a proper intake can lead to adverse issues like malnutrition and muscle loss,0
103,"Further, it has protein sparing action",0
103,Most of them take fruits and vegetables only and it doesn’t give enough protein and fat,0
103,Protein is important for immunity fighting against infection while fat makes hormones,0
103,"”

Experts have emphasised greatly the role that social media played in sparking a negative body image",0
103,"They said that, in turn, lays the foundation for eating disorders to gain a stronghold in the minds of impressionable youngsters",0
103,"“Social media is the forum where the perception of the self and worthiness of the self is measured today,” said Mumbai-based cyber psychologist Nirali Bhatia",0
103,"“Being picture perfect and the need to be accepted, appreciated and acknowledged by others weighs down heavily on a number of people",0
103,"There’s also a huge information overload that has come in with the internet, which provides young children with access to unverified information too early that has the potential to colour their perception",0
103,"”

Raj said that parents and friends should look out for a few tell-tale signs",0
103,"These include malnutrition, sunken eyes, bloated belly, constipation or diarrhoea, erratic menstrual cycle, insomnia or disturbed sleep, waking up in the wee hours of the morning and frequent changes in weight",0
103,"“Eating disorders tend to stem from low self-esteem and peer pressure,” said Bhatia",1
103,“I have noticed that a number of young children are facing issues of binge eating where it forms a cycle of overeating and starvation,0
103,Most of these children are either bullied in person or online and find some comfort in food,0
103,"They tend to get a rush the moment they eat, which relieves their stress and right after that they feel a sense of guilt and starve themselves",0
103,"”

Experts believe that awareness is the key to overcoming these disorders",0
103,They said that most people take these issues lightly as they themselves do not know how these disorders can wreck havoc on their bodies,0
103,"What is an eating disorder?

Persistent disturbance of eating behaviour or behaviour intended to control weight, which significantly impairs physical health or psychosocial functioning, is often turning out to be a chronic psychiatric condition

What are the causes of eating disorders?

Experience phases of binge eating

Eat copious amounts of food, mostly junk food and then purge

Either vomit or misuse laxatives to throw out every ounce of food that their body consumed

Result of a distorted self-image

Consider themselves fat and are scared of putting on any weight

Can lead to abnormal heart beat, bleeding from esophagus due to excessive reflux of stomach acid, kidney failure, and dental problems

104,■ Staying hydrated is important: Have at least three litres (1-12 glasses) of water daily,0
104,■ One can also have protein bars/granola bars/fruits as snacks,0
104,"Foods to avoid

■ Limit your sugar intake as it will give instant gratification but are mere calories that lead to weight gain",0
104,"■ Control the intake of foods rich in carbohydrates like potatoes, rice etc, as they will lead to sleepiness",0
104,"■ Oily foods will only dim your energy levels, so stay away from fried foods",0
104,■ Avoid drinking too much of coffee and tea as it adds to the nervousness,0

which have everything from anti-cancer properties to anti-obesity properties, once used to be the favourite

fruit of schoolchildren in Tamil Nadu",0
105,"You will see vendors selling these jujube fruits along with mangos, groundnuts, and small gooseberries outside most government schools here",0
105,"The way I love to eat elandai vada is where the fruit is crushed by hand (along with the seeds) and added to roughly pounded red chillies, tamarind, salt and asafoetida",0
105,The mixture is made into small round cakes and sun-dried,0
105,"Once sun-dried, it can be stored in bottles",0

107,NEW DELHI: Regular oral care is an important aspect of overall well-being,0
107,"From greater self-confidence to a soaring career, healthy teeth can truly transform the positivity of your mind-set and also create that perfect impression",1
107,Delhi based dentist Ekta Chadha speaks about tips on keeping the pearly whites strong and healthy,0
107,* Target the right area: Toothbrushing is an important part of daily dental care routine,0
107,"Keeping the area where your teeth meet your gums clean can prevent gum disease, while keeping your tooth surfaces clean can help keep cavities at bay",1
107,"Also, changing your toothbrush every 3-4 months is highly recommended if the bristles are frayed",0
107,"* Choosing the right toothpaste: When it comes to choosing the right toothpaste for you, it's important to think about your unique oral health needs",0
107,"For example, if you have sensitive teeth, using a specialized desensitizing toothpaste, instead of basic toothpaste will help provide greater relief and is safe to use as well",0
107,* Flossing is as important as tooth brushing: Cleaning between your teeth may help prevent cavities and remove plaque,1
107,Flossing cleans the areas which are difficult for a toothbrush to reach,0
107,It removes the food debris and plaque accumulated between the teeth,0
107,"* Sugar is the culprit of tooth decay: At every age, a healthy diet is essential for keeping the teeth in a healthy state",1
107,"However, sugary foods have been known as real culprits of tooth decay",0
107,"When bacteria in the mouth break down simple sugars, they produce high acids that can erode tooth enamel, opening the door to decay",0
107,"Hence, it is advisable to cut down on foods and drinks that are high in acid such as sodas",0
107,"Ajay Kakar, a dentist, too has some tips to share:



* You're brushing too hard: Aggressive toothbrushing is a well-intentioned mistake! You may feel that brushing harder will remove more leftover food and the bacteria, but gentle brushing is all that is needed",0
107,"When you brush too hard, it can wear down the teeth enamel and damage the gums",0
107,* Choosing a wrong toothbrush: An important feature of a toothbrush is the bristles that remove the bacteria and loosen plaque from your teeth and gums,0
107,"Sometimes, you may think that the harder the bristles are, the more they'll clean",0
107,But that's not true,0
107,"Compared to hard bristles, soft bristles can clean teeth more effectively",1
107,* Not brushing long enough: The average time a person brushes his teeth is about 33 seconds,0
107,This is only one-sixth the amount of time necessary for teeth to achieve plaque-free status,0
107,"When in doubt, follow the 2s: 2 minutes, 2 times a day rule",0
107,"* Forgetting to clean other parts of the mouth: Another common mistake, while your toothbrush is at work, you may brush your front teeth more than the rest and leave out certain parts of your mouth",0
107,"She suggests that brushing should be an equal opportunity activity, targeting the inside, outside and chewing surfaces of your teeth, as well as your gums, and your tongue",0
107,"* Using an old toothbrush: Do you find yourself using the same old toothbrush while the seasons change around you? Are your brush bristles getting frayed? If yes, bust this bad habit and resolve to use a new brush every three to four months",0
107,* Brushing after meals : Wait at least half an hour before brushing to let your saliva naturally neutralize the acids,0
108,"NEW DELHI: Hydrated, healthy lips can elevate your appearance",0
108,"Use lip balms with superfoods like blueberries, and exfoliate chapped lips with a product with right ingredients like coconut oil or jojoba oil and brown sugar, suggest experts",0
108,"Dolly Kumar, founder at Skinella and Bindiya Gupta, beauty expert at Organic Harvest, have given few inputs:



* Use balms infused with superfoods:



Blueberries: These contain anti-oxidants that protect from premature ageing",0
108,"Grapefruits and mandarins: These are rich in vitamin A and C, minerals and antioxidants and the potassium present in the grapefruit provides a protective shield against UV rays",0
108,"Cranberries: This fruit contains a high percentage of vitamin B3, vitamin B5 and antioxidants making it useful in shielding you from any harm caused due to environmental factors",0
108,* Brush your lips,0
108,"Apply a thin layer of a multipurpose organic balm, then use a soft toothbrush to gently scrub the dead skin off",1
108,Make sure you're using a new toothbrush for this purpose so you don't scrub toothpaste into your lip's delicate skin or dead skin cells onto your teeth,1
108,"* Using coconut oil and sugar is a really simple, inexpensive and easy do-it-yourself to exfoliate your lips",0
108,Mix together a little organic coconut oil with some granulated sugar then scrub your lips with it,0
108,Just rinse it off when you're done and apply a bit of lip balm,0
108,* Rose water and glycerine are both said to have various benefits,0
108,"While rosewater will leave a light pink tint on your lips, the glycerine will take away the dry and dead skin",1
108,Combine both these products and apply it to your lips and get rid of all the dead skin and dryness,1
108,* Use jojoba oil as it will provide the much-wanted nourishment and moisturising effect,0
108,Mix it with brown sugar as it is good for exfoliation,0
108,Scrub your lips with this mix and witness the smooth lips that are free from all the dirt and dryness,1
108,Massage it in for not more than 3-4 minutes,0
108,"* Green tea oil is full of goodness and antioxidants that can help calm, reduce redness, reveal radiance that looks healthy and has a glow all year around",0
108,It makes for the perfect scrub for this time of the year to help prolong the summer glow,0
108,"When applied topically, it is an effective treatment for preventing bleeding lips",0
109,"In many of the mythological stories one grows up with in India, as well as in the more western fairy tales of romance and love, there is often the tests that love has to go through before it is hailed as true and worthy",0
109,"In Indian mythology, there were stories of the lover travelling across seven seas and seven mountains, battling untold miseries, demons and temptations, to get a token that the beloved asked for in a moment of whimsy",0
109,"Or bows had to be strung, flowers plucked from treacherous mountain tops, jewellery made or houses built",1
109,"There were royals who decried that the suitor must prove worthy of the royal heir’s love by solving a dozen puzzles, battling wild animals and what not",1
109,Other cultures had similar stories as well,0
109,"Japanese stories of star-crossed lovers who wait eternities to meet their loved one, Hawaiian stories of a lover chasing the moon where it meets the sea to bring pearls like never seen before",0
109,Hundreds and thousands of stories of lovers proving their love’s true worth before the happy ending,0
109,"In real life, or IRL as we know it nowadays, do we still test love before accepting it? We may not ask for the moon or jewels or what have you, but test we still do",0
109,"All the time, some times",0
109,"The tests are often quite small: “Give me your phone, I want to see your pictures",0
109,” “What’s your password for your google mail?” “My mother wants to meet you,0
109,"What are you doing this weekend?” If the answer is not quite what is expected, the grades on the love test start to dip",0
109,"There are so many other little tests, like when you are walking together and you are reaching out with your hand, and though both of you are looking ahead, you still look if your hand is being held",0
109,"Or that time when you are in a mall, and you watch to see who your lover is watching",0
109,"Even after years of being together, the testing continues in subtle and not so subtle ways: could be about who brings the milk in, or walks the dog on a rainy day, or who gets to decide where one goes for the Sunday dinner",0
109,"Then, can you really stop testing ever? How long before you know well and for sure that all the testing is done and it is a given, now and forever? Or are we doomed as a species to forever test and be tested, with only the intermittent lulls of peace and quiet, like summer and Christmas holidays between unit tests and term exams at school?

An old friend once had an insight to offer: the real test, according to them, was if you could scratch where it itched and let your body be as it will, making whatever sound it would, whenever it needed to, without feeling judged for it",0
109,"“Have you found that love?” I asked, and that friend laughed, “No, I still judge!”",1
110,"LONDON: Turns out, early puberty is linked to the increased risk of obesity for women",1
110,"According to a study led by the Imperial College London, girls who start puberty earlier are more likely to be overweight as adults",1
110,The researchers say their findings strengthen existing evidence of a link between the onset of puberty and a woman's body mass in adulthood,0
110,"Previous studies have established a link between obesity and puberty, with increased bodyweight known to be a risk factor for girls starting puberty earlier",1
110,"But now this latest research shows that early puberty is itself a risk factor for being overweight, with girls who have their first period earlier more likely to have a higher Body Mass Index (BMI)",0
110,"According to the authors of the study, their findings help to untangle these complex external factors and add insight into an underlying causal link, showing that early puberty has a significant impact on a woman's risk of obesity",0
110,"Dr Dipender Gill, the first author of the study, said: ""Previous studies have shown there is an association, but we didn't know whether early puberty caused obesity in adulthood, or was simply associated with it",0
110,"In our latest study, we've generated evidence to support that it is a causal effect",0
110,"""

In order to get around the effects of confounding factors, the research team used genetic variants as a tool to look at the effect of the onset of puberty (known as age at menarche), measured as the age of a girl's first period",0
110,"In the latest study, researchers employed a statistical technique called Mendelian Randomization which uses these genetic variants as a tool to show the causal relationship between earlier puberty and increased BMI",0
110,"Using data from 182,416 women they identified 122 genetic variants that were strongly associated with the onset of puberty - with the women's age at first period obtained via questionnaire",0
110,"Initial analysis revealed a link between these genetic variants and BMI, with those women who had variants associated with earlier puberty having an increased BMI",1
110,"The researchers then tested for this same association in a third group 70,962 women, finding the same association",0
110,"Dr Gill, added, ""Some of these genetic variants are associated with earlier puberty and some with later onset, so by taking advantage of this we were able to investigate any association of age at menarche with BMI in adulthood”",0
110,"""We're not saying that it's a genetic effect, but rather that by using these genetic variants as a proxy for earlier puberty, we are able to show the effect of earlier puberty without the impact of external factors that might confound our analysis",1
110,"We performed a range of statistical sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings and they remained strong through this, so within the limitations of the study design, we are confident of findings",0
110,"""

According to the researchers, it remains unclear how maturing earlier has a direct impact on body weight, but they indicate that differences between physical and emotional maturity may play a role",0
110,It could be that young women who mature earlier than their peers are treated differently or have different societal pressures than girls of the same age who have not started puberty,0
110,"Another explanation could be the physical effects of hormonal changes during puberty, such as increased fat deposition in breast tissue, which when established earlier may move them to a higher risk profile for higher BMI or obesity in later life",0
110,"""It is difficult to say that changing someone's age of puberty will affect their adult risk of obesity and whether it is something that we can clinically apply - as it would unlikely be ethically appropriate to accelerate or delay the rate of puberty to affect BMI,"" added Dr Gill",0
110,"""But it is useful for us to be aware that it's a causal factor- girls who reach puberty earlier may be more likely to be overweight when they are older",0
110,"""

The findings from this study are published in the International Journal of Obesity",0
111,"LONDON: A study has challenged the idea that it might be possible to be overweight or obese but not at increased risk of heart disease, otherwise known as the ‘obesity paradox’",1
111,"According to the study led by the European Society of Cardiology, the risk of heart and blood vessel problems, such as heart attacks, strokes, and high blood pressure, increases as body mass index (BMI) increases beyond 22-23 kg/m2",0
111,"Furthermore, the risk also increases steadily the more fat a person carries around their waist",0
111,"The study was conducted in 296,535 adults of white European descent who are taking part in the UK Biobank study, and who were healthy at the time they enrolled in the study",0
111,"UK Biobank recruited from 2006 to 2010, and follow-up data on participants were available up to 2015 for this latest analysis",0
111,Researchers at the University of Glasgow led by Dr Stamatina Iliodromiti found that people with a BMI between 22-23 kg/m2 had the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD),0
111,"Compared to women and men with waist circumferences of 74 and 83 cm respectively, the CVD risk increased by16 percent in women and 10 percent in men for every 12",0
111,6 cm and 11,0
111,4 cm increase in waist circumference for women and men respectively,0
111,"Similar increases in CVD risk were seen when the researchers looked at waist-to-hip and waist-to-height ratios and percentage body fat mass - all of which are considered reliable ways to accurately gauge the amount of fat a person carries, also known as adiposity",0
111,"Although it is already known that being overweight or obese increases a person's risk of CVD, as well as other diseases such as cancer, there have also been studies that have suggested that, particularly in the elderly, being overweight or even obese might not have any effect on deaths from CVD or other causes, and may even be protective, especially if people maintain a reasonable level of fitness",0
111,"This is known as the ""obesity paradox""",0
111,"However, the authors of the study said their results refute these previous conflicting findings",0
111,"""Any public misconception of a potential 'protective' effect of fat on heart and stroke risks should be challenged,"" said Dr Iliodromiti",0
111,"She continued, ""This is the largest study that provides evidence against the obesity paradox in healthy people",1
111,"It is possible that the story may be different for those with the pre-existing disease because there is evidence that in cancer patients, for instance, being slightly overweight is associated with lower risk, especially as cancer and its treatments can lead to unhealthy weight loss",0
111,"""By maintaining a healthy BMI of around 22-23 kg/m2, healthy people can minimise their risk of developing or dying from heart disease",1
111,"In terms of other adiposity measures, the less fat, especially around their abdomen, they have, the lower the risk of future heart disease",1
111,"""

However, the researchers recognise that it can be difficult for some people to maintain a BMI of 22-23 kg/m2, particularly as they get older",0
111,"Co-author, Naveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine at the University of Glasgow, said, ""We know many cannot get to such low BMIs so the message is, whatever your BMI, especially when in the overweight or obese range, losing a few kilograms or more if possible, will only improve your health",0
111,There are no downsides to losing weight intentionally and the health professions need to get better at helping people lose weight,0
111,"""

The researchers say their findings may have implications for guidelines on preventing and managing cardiovascular disease",0
111,"The researchers suggest that the previous confusion over the ""obesity paradox"" may be due to many factors that can confound results of studies",0
111,"For instance, smoking changes the distribution of fat in the body, smokers may have lower weight as smoking depresses appetites and so BMI tends to be lower",0
111,"Another reason could be that some people have existing but undiagnosed disease, which can often lower their weight but also makes them more likely to die prematurely",0
111,The findings from this study are published in the European Heart Journal,0

Relaxation response

During sleep, there is a reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and minute ventilation, and there is decreased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide elimination",0

116,LONDON: Experts have come up with a trick to do before bed to ultimately help you doze off faster,1
116,"The conundrum of being shatteringly tired before bed, yet not able to sleep off, is not unheard of",1
116,"Now it has been revealed that it is incredibly simple to doze off, as soon as your head hit the pillow – all you need to do is, write a very specific to-do list",1
116,"Yes, it seems unbelievable but a study has explained that writing down the tasks you need to do the next day will help calm your brain and make you relax",0
116,The study stated that one of the main reasons people lie awake at night is because they worry about things they need to perform the next day,0
116,"“We live in a 24/7 culture in which our to-do lists seem to be constantly growing and causing us to worry about unfinished tasks at bedtime,” said lead study author Dr Michael K Scullin, as quoted by The Independent",0
116,"“Most people just cycle through their to-do lists in their heads, and so we wanted to explore whether the act of writing them down could counteract nighttime difficulties with falling asleep",0

118,"But, if it's not, you may end up feeling a bit low",0
118,Hair loss or thinning is quite common amongst women as also,0
118,"It’s not just women in their forties or fifties who face hair loss, it can also strike a younger lot",1
118,“Most cases of increased hair shedding gradually resolve on their own without treatment,0
118,"But, if your hair doesn’t return to its normal fullness after 6 to 9 months, then you may require hair treatments,” said Prerna Taneja, Medical Director Clinic Eximus",1
118,"Listed below are some of the most common causes of hair loss in women:

Emotional or physical stress: When you’re going through a stressful phase, you may experience hair loss as your body puts its resources towards getting you through that sad event",0
118,"Also, overexerting yourself physically can also result in losing strands",0
118,"Pollution: Sudden hair loss is imminent if the contaminants of air, including particulate matter, dust, smoke, nickel, lead and arsenic, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons settle on your scalp and hair",0

118,"Heredity: If your family trend has always been in a way where women suffer from hair loss at a certain age, then you might be more prone to the same",0
118,"Here are some treatments for hair loss:

Mesotherapy: It involves imparting a combination of various nutrients and medication that boosts hair growth naturally",0
118,"Platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP): In this treatment, the patient’s blood is drawn and is then processed",0
118,The platelet-rich blood is inserted via an injection into the problem areas of skin to organically support hair growth,0

121,* Watch your diet: It is said that what we eat before going to sleep has an immense impact on how well we doze off,0
121,"Pregnant mothers should ideally eat light during dinner, and avoid acidic, oil-rich or fatty foods",1
121,"Additionally, they should ensure that there is at least an hour's gap between their finishing dinner and going to sleep",0
121,"Furthermore, it is not ideal to directly go into a resting position after eating and pregnant women should ideally take a short walk before going to sleep",0
121,"* Identify a comfortable position: With a protruding belly, it can become difficult to find a comfortable sleeping position",1
121,"As per some reports, it is suggested that pregnant women start sleeping on their left side, as it increases the amount of blood and nutrients that reach the baby",1
121,"From the third trimester onwards, women should practice sleeping on the left side and not on their backs as the weight of the baby can compress the mother's major blood vessels",0
121,"* Choose the perfect mattress: It is essential for pregnant women to sleep in a bed that is comfortable and has a clean, comfortable and sturdy mattress",1
121,"Recently, various modern-day mattress innovators such as Wakefit have brought about a revolution of sorts in the mattress industry by introducing a unique offering called memory foam mattresses",0
121,"These mattresses can adjust themselves according to the body contours of the sleeper, thereby giving a feeling of being cocooned in a cozy space for that ultimate sleep",0
121,* Cut down on fluid intake during night: It is an oft-repeated advice to ensure the undisturbed sleep of pregnant mothers is not broken by repeated visits to the bathroom,0
121,"Also, keeping perfumed potpourri or soap, scented candles etc, near the bed helps to tide over those pressing bouts of nausea",0
121,"* Consume light, happy content: Reading gory books before bed-time or watching extremely tense, edge-of-the-seat thrillers before sleep can often have a negative impact on the body",0
121,It is advised that pregnant mothers should start slowing down 1,0

130,NEW DELHI: People have heard of cardiovascular diseases even if they haven't undergone a procedure personally,1
130,"While cardiovascular diseases are generally considered a man's issue, globally, they claim more lives of women than men",0
130,"In regards to women, symptoms become more evident after the onset of menopause",0
130,"Highlighting the risk factors causing the increase in risk of cardiovascular health in women, Dr Manjiri Mehta Consultant Gynecologist, Obstetrician, Laparoscopic surgeon, Hiranandani Hospital Vashi- A Fortis Network Hospital said, ""Menopause does not cause cardiovascular disease per say; however certain risk factors at the time of menopause like a high-fat diet, early age smoking etc",1
130,certainly take a toll on one's cardiovascular health,0
130,"The reason why menopause is the center of the discussion here is because during the time of menopause, the body goes through hormonal havoc",0
130,"""

• Estrogen levels play a role

A decline in the natural hormone-estrogen is a factor when it comes to decline in cardiovascular health in post-menopausal women",0
130,Estrogen has always been believed to play a pivotal role in the positive effect on the inner layer of the arterial walls,0
130,These hormones considerably reduce the risk of stroke in women,0
130,"However, several studies about the various other factors causing the decline in cardiovascular health are still under different stages of research",0
130,"• Cardiovascular health history

Being an ardent follower of a healthy lifestyle and continuing the same during menopause, considerably reduces the risk of a heart disease or a stroke",0
130,A person with a history of cardiovascular diseases running in the family is at a heightened risk,1
130,"Given the increased risk, a person should be vary of their cardiovascular health and take adequate precautions",0
130,"• After menopause, there is a risk of increase in cardiac disease as the protection offered by estrogen declines",1
130,"At the age of 50, more than 50% of the deaths occur in women due to problems related to cardiac health",0
130,Further complications are basically worsening of cardiac function and dip in the quality of life,0
130,"• Generally, women who frequently smoke are diabetic and hypertensive or have a family history of these along with bad cholesterol",0
130,"Thus, they are at a higher risk of having cardiac disease post-menopause",0
130,"• The falling levels of estrogen impact the bones too, apart from the heart",0
130,The bones might become thin and prone to fractures,0
130,"• The risk factors of cardiac disease are stroke, thrombosis in veins and thinning of bones, amongst post-menopausal women",0
130,"• As per recommendations, women in their late 40s and early 50s should be following a dietary pattern that is rich in:

Carbohydrates and proteins",0
130,"- A meal comprising of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, nuts are necessary for a healthy heart",0
130,- Physical activity for at least an hour is must to keep the risk of cardiovascular diseases at bay,1

131,"WASHINGTON: Here's a hack to slowdown your age clock!

According to a study, a lifetime of regular exercise can delay aging",0
131,The researchers at the University of Birmingham and King's College London set out to assess the health of older adults who had exercised most of their adult lives to see if this could slow down aging,0
131,"The study recruited 125 amateur cyclists aged 55 to 79, 84 of which were male and 41 were female",1
131,The men had to be able to cycle 100 km in under 6,0

131,5 hours,0
131,"Smokers, heavy drinkers and those with high blood pressure or other health conditions were excluded from the study",0
131,The participants underwent a series of tests in the laboratory and were compared to a group of adults who do not partake in regular physical activity,0
131,This group consisted of 75 healthy people aged 57 to 80 and 55 healthy young adults aged 20 to 36,1
131,The study showed that loss of muscle mass and strength did not occur in those who exercise regularly,1
131,"The cyclists also did not increase their body fat or cholesterol levels with age and the men's testosterone levels also remained high, suggesting that they may have avoided most of the male menopause",0
131,"More surprisingly, the study also revealed that the benefits of exercise extend beyond muscle as the cyclists also had an immune system that did not seem to have aged either",0
131,"An organ called the thymus, which makes immune cells called T cells, starts to shrink from the age of 20 and makes less T cells",0
131,"In this study, however, the cyclists' thymuses were making as many T cells as those of a young person",0
131,The findings come as figures show that less than half of over 65s do enough exercise to stay healthy and more than half of those aged over 65 suffer from at least two diseases,0
131,"Professor Janet Lord, Director of the Institute of Inflammation and Ageing at the University of Birmingham, said: ""Hippocrates in 400 BC said that exercise is man's best medicine, but his message has been lost over time and we are an increasingly sedentary society",0
131,"""However, importantly, our findings debunk the assumption that ageing automatically makes us more frail",0
131,"""Our research means we now have strong evidence that encouraging people to commit to regular exercise throughout their lives is a viable solution to the problem that we are living longer but not healthier",1
131,"""

Dr Niharika Arora Duggal, also of the University of Birmingham, said: ""We hope these findings prevent the danger that, as a society, we accept that old age and disease are normal bedfellows and that the third age of man is something to be endured and not enjoyed",0
131,"""

Professor Stephen Harridge, Director of the Centre of Human & Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King's College London, said: ""The findings emphasise the fact that the cyclists do not exercise because they are healthy, but that they are healthy because they have been exercising for such a large proportion of their lives",0
131,"""Their bodies have been allowed to age optimally, free from the problems usually caused by inactivity",0
131,Remove the activity and their health would likely deteriorate,0
131,"""

Norman Lazarus, Emeritus Professor at King's College London and also a master cyclist and Dr Ross Pollock, who undertook the muscle study, both agreed that: ""Most of us who exercise have nowhere near the physiological capacities of elite athletes",0
131,"""We exercise mainly to enjoy ourselves",0
131,Nearly everybody can partake in an exercise that is in keeping with their own physiological capabilities,0
131,"""Find an exercise that you enjoy in whatever environment that suits you and make a habit of physical activity",0

132,"Men regret casual sex much less overall than women do, although it does happen, said the study published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences",1
132,"""The factor that clearly distinguishes women from men is the extent to which they themselves take the initiative,"" said one of the researchers Mons Bendixen, Associate Professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)",0
132,"In contrast to women, sexual regret for men was not found to be affected by whether they took the initiative",1
132,"""Women who initiate sex are likely to have at least two distinguishing qualities,"" said Professor David Buss from the University of Texas at Austin in the US",0
132,"""First, they are likely to have a healthy sexual psychology, being maximally comfortable with their own sexuality",0
132,"Second, women who initiate have maximum choice of precisely who they want to have sex with",0
132,"Consequently, they have less reason to feel regret, since they've made their own choice,"" Buss added",1
132,"While initiative is the clearest gender-differentiating factor for regret after casual sex, other conditions can also affect how much an individual regrets the encounter",0
132,"""Women feel less regret if the partner was skilled and they felt sexually satisfied,"" said Leif Edvard Ottesen Kennair, Professor at NTNU",1
132,"But these effects are not as strong in men, Bendixen said",0
132,"""Women have less regret if the sex was good",0
132,"For men, this also plays a less important role",0
132,"The underlying causes are biological,"" Bendixen said",0
132,Women also feel disgust more often than men after a short-term sexual encounter,0
132,"This is a key factor in whether or not they feel regret, the study said",0
132,"""The feeling of disgust or revulsion is the single factor that best explained why women and men regretted the last time they had casual sex when we controlled for all other factors,"" Bendixen said",0

145,"The study showed that smiles meant to convey dominance are associated with a physical reaction ""a spike in stress hormones"" in their targets",1
145,"On the other hand, smiles intended as a reward, to reinforce behaviour, appear to physically buffer recipients against stress",1
145,"Researchers established three major types of smiles as dominance -- meant to convey status --, affiliation -- which communicates a bond and shows you are not a threat --, and reward -- the sort of beaming, toothy smile you would give someone to let them know they are making you happy",0

147,"The good news is that their heart is healthy, the bad news is that their stress-related anxiety is a medical condition called cardiac neurosis/apprehension",0
147,"Cardiologists say that they see three to four such youngsters, in the 25 to 40 age group, every day",0
147,Their fear comes from their stressful work environment and seeing colleagues being diagnosed with a heart condition,0
147,"Besides work-related stress, these professionals are also worried about their lifestyle choices that include heavy smoking and lack of sleep from night shifts",0
147,"Cardiologist Dr Pradeep Haranahalli, of Manipal Hospital in Whitefield, with over 12 years’ experience, explains cardiac neurosis: The fear and anxiety that an individual faces over his/her heart which “is generally caused when they see someone who has a heart problem with a similar lifestyle to theirs”",0
147,Those suffering from this fear do not necessarily have a heart disorder,0
147,"Men are commonly diagnosed with coronary artery disease, making them more vulnerable to this neurosis",0

147,"Although the pressure is less, working hours are still the same and there is still no time to work on health",0

148,The two-weekend workshop gave the participants an opportunity to speak about past experiences and learn from those mistakes,0
148,"“We learned how to prevent such situations from happening in the first place,” she says",0
148,"Most self-defense workshops for women focus on two aspects — increasing mental strength and reactive ability, and teaching physical moves to defend oneself",1
148,A good balance of both is necessary for easy escape,0

148,"”

Physical self-defense techniques that are taught include a variety of mixed martial art forms, focussing more on the defensive side than attack side",0
148,And most workshops also have a pseudo-attacker to practice live,0
148,"“These live demonstrations are the most interesting part of the workshop because we could practice the key defensive movements that were taught,” says Dhanupriya, saying she still practices these punches during her running fitness routines every morning",0
148,"Though many women opt for longer training courses after these short workshops, specialising in one form of martial arts, there are many who don’t have the time and ability to do so",0
148,"So in that case, will a two-hour workshop be sufficient? “The objective of the workshop is not to make women Bruce Lees in one hour but to make them feel that any untrained person can, at the least, escape from a situation",0

* Face cleansers: Regular skin cleansing at night is critical to maintaining a healthy skin",0
149,A clean and dirt-free face helps keep pores open and aids the skin to breathe better,1
149,"Restore the skin's natural balance by using cleansers made with Ayurvedic ingredients such as aloe vera, turmeric, honey that leave the skin clean, hydrated and nourished",0
149,* Moisturise: Moisturising should be an essential step in your night skincare regime,0
149,"It helps in repairing your skin, keeping it soft and prevents it from sagging",0
149,"Apply a cream that has natural and nourishing ingredients like kokum butter and honey, especially for hands and feet before going to sleep at night",0
149,* Under eye gel: The area under the eyes is the first to show signs of ageing,0
149,"Apply an under-eye gel every night before going to bed to reduce puffiness, wrinkles and dark circles under the eyes",0
149,* Lip balms: An effective lip balm keeps moisture in and protects lips from dryness and cracking,0
149,"Pick a lip balm that is made with natural ingredients such as ghee and almond oil, that will help heal, condition and keep your lips soft and supple",0
149,* Dark circles make your skin tone look uneven,0
149,"Avacado and almonds are not only good for your health but for your eyes too, apply their oils and wake up with puffy-less eyes and reduced dark circle; with regular application, say bye-bye to them",0
149,* Sleep on silk pillow: A silk night suit is an excellent choice but a silk pillowcase will be even better,1
149,"Silk is easier on your face and your hair, as it reduces split ends and gives you a crease-free face in the morning",0
149,* Let your skin breathe in and breathe out: One mistake most people make is sleeping with their make-up on,1
149,Not only is it unhealthy for your skin but there is a big chance that it might lead to breakouts and skin dehydration,1
149,It is extremely essential to remove your make-up before sleeping for a rejuvenated skin,0
149,"* CTM process: After you are done with cleansing and toning, use a light moisturiser for nourishment, then use nourishing serum and a night cream post that",0
149,"For night, you need products with more nourishing ingredient and no SPF involved",0
149,* Pamper your hands and feet: Beauty is not only about your face,0
149,It is achieved when the entire body feels great,0
149,Give your hands and feet the care they deserve by moisturising them before hitting the bed,0
149,Nourishment is essential for a happy and healthy body,0
150,"Have you ever wondered about the ‘gut’, which may be more than a collection of cells? It is smarter than you know and plays a significant role in absorbing essential nutrients that provide energy to your body",0
150,The microbes in our gut are more than the number of people on this planet,0
150,About 70 per cent of the body’s immunity is found there,0
150,Our immune system is central to all aspects of health,0
150,"When it works well, we fight all infections and when it doesn’t, it ensures that we are at the risk of developing all kinds of diseases",0
150,"Not only that, the gut is often called the second brain because it is loaded with neurotransmitters",0
150,"In fact, more serotonin (happy hormone) is produced in the gut than anywhere else in the body",0
150,The gut can actually communicate with the brain and therefore gut bacteria are crucial in determining your mood and anxiety,1
150,Nurturing our gut bacteria so that they are more beneficial than harmful is one of the most important choices that we can make for our health,1
150,"Thus, consuming probiotics or beneficial bacteria that restore better digestive health and help the immune function in a more balanced manner is essential",0
150,"There is growing evidence that probiotic bacteria can help reduce our chance of catching certain infections, and also help us recover from them faster",0
150,"People who consume probiotics are better able to fight off flu, cold and diarrhoeal illness",0
150,Researchers in Washington DC who were studying children found that probiotic consumption resulted in lower rates of gastrointestinal infections and also fewer upper respiratory tract infections,0
150,Other trials have found fewer acute respiratory tract infections and less antibiotic consumption among probiotic consumers of all ages,1
150,"Dr Mary Ellen Sanders, who serves as the executive director of the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP), agrees that there is a compelling data to support the use of probiotics for a number of conditions like antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, diarrhoeal illness and even common cold",0
150,But not all consumers understand probiotics,0
150,Some products labelled probiotic do not contain strains shown to be effective nor deliver adequate levels,0
150,The catch is that all probiotics are not the same and therefore every probiotic should be scientifically validated for its health benefits,0
150,"So, when you pick your next probiotic, remember that the ‘gut’ is more than just a ‘gut feeling’",1

151,This preparation contains platinum,0
151,"Now, all of you must have heard stories about Siddha and Ayurvedic medicines containing heavy metals and as to how they damage the kidney and liver",0
151,As far as I know there has not been a single instance where metallic preparations of reputed Ayurvedic drug manufacturers prescribed by qualified and experienced vaidyars have caused either nephrotoxicity or hepato-toxicity,0
151,"In Ayurveda, since digestion is considered a key to good health, things that compromise the functioning of organs involved in the processing of foods or elimination of wastes would never be prescribed",0
151,"At all times, Ayurvedic management of disease lays emphasis on not compromising the agni or digestive fire",0
151,"Therefore, medicines that affect the kidney or liver, the agni or digestive fire would not be prescribed",0
151,"Cisplatin, which contains platinum, is an allopathy doctor’s drug of choice for treating many cancers",0
151,But it is nephrotoxic and affects the proper functioning of kidney,0
151,"It injures the renal epithelial cells and produces inflammation, which affects proper voiding of urine",0
151,Cisplatin has an adverse effect on the renal tubules and the glomerular filtration rate and may even cause permanent kidney damage in some cases,0
151,Cisplatin also causes hearing impairment and is oto-toxic,0
151,"It is also neurotoxic, inducing sensory neuropathy of the upper and lower extremities",0
151,Other platinum anti-cancer drugs called Carboplatin and Oxaliplatin have similar side-effects,0
151,None of the Ayurvedic and Siddha metallic preparations are toxic when prepared and should be used judiciously by experienced vaidyars,1
151,"They may be misused by the quacks, but the drugs themselves are not neurotoxic, hepato-toxic or nephrotoxic",0
151,The reasons Ayurvedic metallic preparations are not toxic is because the metals are first subjected to purificatory measures,1
151,Vaidyars use natural acidic and alkaline substances to purify the metals and then subject them to varying degrees of heat to convert them into a bhasma or nanoparticles,0
151,They look like magic potions,0
151,But many Indian transformations are like that  we take urad dal and rice and make delicious dosas,0
151,Ayurveda makes use of the poisonous strychnos nux-vomica to make potent medicines for treating nerve disorders,0
151,"No one has died of strychnine poisoning by consuming the drug, although strychnine by itself is highly toxic",0
151,This is because the Ayurvedic vaidyars of yore knew about proper purification techniques,0
151,"Now we have Dhootpapeshwar, a 125-year-old company, and Dabur, both manufacturing herbo-mineral and metallic preparations and selling them to thousands of people",1
151,"If these drugs were so toxic, we should have had thousands of cases of nephrotoxicity and people dying like flies",0
151,"But that is not happening, nor has anyone scientifically proven that these Ayurvedic preparations are toxic",1
151,All that the detractors can say is that so and so medicine contains heavy metals or arsenic,0
151,"Of course, some of the Ayurvedic preparations contain metals",0
151,The point to remember is that these preparations are not toxic if prepared and used in the proper Ayurvedic way,1

153,The researchers explored how prenatal exposure to androgens -- hormones that are typically higher in males than in females -- affected whether girls played more often with boys or girls,1
153,"They found that androgen exposure was not associated with girls spending more or less time in activities with other girls, but it was associated with an increased interest and more time spent in activities that have traditionally been thought of as masculine",0
153,"""People used to think -- and some still do -- that gender development and behaviour is based either on a person's biology or social environment",0

153,The researchers examined the effects of hormones on sex segregation by studying girls with classical and non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH),0

153,The researchers found that there was no significant association between androgen exposure and girls' time spent with either boys or girls,1

154,The researchers zeroed in on GPR158 as a player in depression after discovering that the protein is elevated in people with major depressive disorder,1
154,"To better understand GPR158's role, the scientists studied male and female mice with and without GPR158 receptors",0
154,Behavioural tests revealed that both male and female mice with elevated GPR158 show signs of depression following chronic stress,1
154,"On the flip side, suppression of GPR158 protects mice from developing depressive-like behaviours and make them resilient to stress",0
154,"For the study, published in the journal eLife, the researchers also examined why GPR158 has these effects on depression",1
154,"The team demonstrated that GPR158 affects key signaling pathways involved in mood regulation in the region of the brain called prefrontal cortex, though the researchers emphasised that the exact mechanisms remain to be established",0
154,"The researchers explained that GPR158 is a so-called ""orphan receptor"" -- which gets its name because its binding partner/partners are unknown -- with a poorly understood biology and mechanism of action",0

159,"WASHINGTON: Turns out, social stigma comes in the way of families to ask for outside help for food security – meaning possessing enough money to provide food for the family",1
159,"According to a Drexel University- study, screening for food insecurity at the paediatrician's office can be quite effective, but fear of Child Protective Services and a complicated referral process could be barriers to food insecure families getting the help they need",0
159,"A two-question food insecurity screening was added to the visits of more than 7,000 families at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) over a two-year period to find out how useful it was",1
159,The evaluation of the effort - run by the Center for Hunger-Free Communities of Drexel University's Dornsife School of Public Health in collaboration with CHOP and Benefits Data Trust - sought to determine what barriers there might be to implementing such screening and how it could be made most successful,0
159,"""The screening itself worked very well: Providers could incorporate it into their workflow, and many parents and caregivers responded,"" said Molly Knowles, who served as the lead author of the study",0
159,"More than 1,000 families - roughly 15 percent - of the families involved reported food insecurity (meaning that they did not have enough money for consistent access to food)",1
159,"Of that group, more than half were referred to Benefits Data Trust for further services and resources",1
159,But the challenge came after these initial interactions,0
159,It was then that connections were dropped,0
159,"""Because of patient privacy and confidentiality protections, there were several steps in between being able to identify a food insecure family and connecting them with resources,"" Knowles explained",1
159,"""That meant that parents - more than 60 percent - weren't able to connect with the referral agency",0
159,"""

Red tape wasn't the only major barrier discovered by the study",0
159,"Parents were also initially reluctant to say that they were struggling to feed their families, for fear that they'd be reported as unfit caregivers",0
159,"""Parents know that healthcare providers are mandatory reporters of child abuse and neglect, and although food insecurity is not a form of neglect, many parents described feelings of shame and fear of Child Protective Services involvement,"" Knowles explained",0
159,The study showed that medical professionals were eager to implement the hunger screening and parents reported interest in being asked about food needs: everything just came down to better communication,0
159,"With that, any unfounded fears from parents might be alleviated, and other obstacles could be solved by health providers from the outset",0
159,"Something that the researchers didn't expect to find was that of those who reported being food insecure and referred for help, 79 percent already participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps)",0
159,"""Parents recommended connecting families with immediate resources - not only food resources, but other resources that could free up household budgets for food - to supplement any public benefits they may already receive,"" Knowles said",0
159,"So that fewer families are lost between their screening and being referred to an assisting agency, Knowles recommended getting families' consent to share contact info right away at the first screening",0
159,"Although this study only took place at CHOP in Philadelphia, its results fall in line with others",0
159,The interest is certainly there for the screening,0

165,The researchers found that cardiolipin -- a molecule inside nerve cells -- helps ensure that a protein called alpha-synuclein folds properly,1
165,Misfolding of this protein leads to protein deposits that are the hallmark of Parkinson's disease,1
165,"""Identifying the crucial role cardiolipin plays in keeping these proteins functional means cardiolipin may represent a new target for development of therapies against Parkinson's disease,"" said Scott Ryan, Professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada",0
165,"""Currently there are no treatments that stop nerve cells from dying,"" Ryan added",0
165,These deposits are toxic to nerve cells that control voluntary movement,0

165,The team studied how nerve cells try to cope with misfolded alpha-synuclein,1
165,"""We thought if we can better understand how cells normally fold alpha-synuclein, we may be able to exploit that process to dissolve these aggregates and slow the spread of the disease,"" Ryan said",0
165,"The study revealed that, inside cells, alpha-synuclein binds to mitochondria, where cardiolipin resides",0
165,Cells use mitochondria to generate energy and drive metabolism,0
165,"Normally, cardiolipin in mitochondria pulls synuclein out of toxic protein deposits and refolds it into a non-toxic shape, the researchers added",0

167,"Ketamine and related drugs may represent a ""paradigm shift"" in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression - especially in patients who do not respond to other treatments, according to a research review by Carlos A Zarate, and colleagues from the US National Institute of Mental Health",0
167,Current treatments for MDD and bipolar depression have major limitations,0
167,Many patients with severe depressive symptoms don't respond to available antidepressant drugs,1
167,"Even for those who do respond, it may take several weeks before symptoms improve",0
167,"Ketamine, an anaesthetic, is one of several glutamatergic drugs affecting neurotransmitters in the central nervous system",0
167,"Over the past decade, several studies have reported ""rapid, robust, and relatively sustained antidepressant response"" to ketamine, injected intravenously at low, subanaesthetic doses",0
167,Scientists reviewed research on ketamine and other glutamatergic drugs for depression,0
167,"Ketamine, by far the best-studied of these medications, is notable for its very rapid antidepressant effects",0
167,"In patients with treatment-resistant MDD, ketamine has produced initial reductions in depressive symptoms within two hours, with peak effects at 24 hours",1
167,Ketamine may also rapidly reduce suicidal thoughts,0
167,"Combined with other medications, ketamine has also produced rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression",1
167,"Prompted by these studies, some doctors are already using ketamine in patients with severe or treatment-resistant depression",1
167,"However, since it is approved only as an anaesthetic, use of ketamine in depressive disorders is ""off-label,"" unregulated, and not standardised",0
167,Many questions remain about its short- and long-term side effects and potential for abuse,0
167,"""Efforts are underway to bring ketamine to market, standardise its use, and determine its real-world effectiveness,"" said Zarate",0
167,Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital in the US reviewed neuroimaging studies evaluating ketamine's effects in the brain,0
167,The studies show ketamine-induced changes in several brain areas involved in the development of depression,0
167,"Ketamine may exert its antidepressant effects by disabling the emotional resources required to perpetuate the symptoms of depression, as well as by increasing emotional blunting and increasing activity in reward processing researchers said",0
168,"LONDON: Excessive use of phones and tablets is preventing children's finger muscles from developing sufficiently, making it increasingly hard for them to hold pens and pencils, UK doctors say",1
168,"""Children are not coming into school with the hand strength and dexterity they had 10 years ago,"" said Sally Payne, the head paediatric therapist at the Heart of England Foundation NHS Trust in the UK",0
168,"""Children coming into school are being given a pencil but are increasingly not be able to hold it because they do not have the fundamental movement skills,"" said Payne",0
168,"""To be able to grip a pencil and move it, you need strong control of the fine muscles in your fingers",1
168,"Children need lots of opportunities to develop those skills,"" she said",0
168,"""It's easier to give a child an iPad than encouraging them to do muscle-building play such as building blocks, cutting and sticking, or pulling toys and ropes,"" Payne was quoted as saying by the 'Guardian'",0
168,"Mellissa Prunty, who runs a research clinic at Brunel University London investigating key skills in childhood, including handwriting, said that increasing numbers of children may be developing handwriting late because of an overuse of technology",0
168,"""One problem is that handwriting is very individual in how it develops in each child,"" said Prunty",1
168,"""Without research, the risk is that we make too many assumptions about why a child isn't able to write at the expected age and don't intervene when there is a technology-related cause,"" she said",0
168,"Although the early years' curriculum has handwriting targets for every year, different primary schools focus on handwriting in different ways - with some using tablets alongside pencils, Prunty said",1
168,This becomes a problem when same the children also spend large periods of time on tablets outside the school,1
169,"SEOUL: Scientists have developed a smart contact lens that can monitor blood sugar levels from tears in the eye in patients with diabetes, spelling an end for painful needle pricks",1
169,"For diabetics, monitoring and controlling blood sugar levels are extremely important because having high blood glucose levels for extended periods of time can lead to a host of diabetes complications",1
169,An enzyme-based finger-pricking method is the most commonly used technology in diabetic assessment,0
169,"However, such approach has been said to reduce compliance among diabetic patients",0
169,"The smart lens, developed by researchers from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), has built-in pliable, transparent electronics that can monitor glucose levels from tears in the eye",1
169,"Although the device has not yet been tested in humans, researchers expect it will offer diabetics a pain-free way to measure their glucose levels in the blink of an eye",0
169,"In the last several decades, many attempts have been made to monitor glucose levels in tears with smart contact lenses, but they are often not used due to poor wearability",0
169,"To solve contact lens discomfort issues, the team led by Jang-Ung Park of UNIST have unveiled a new smart contact lens that uses electrodes made up of highly stretchable and transparent materials",1
169,"The clear, flexible lens also contains a glucose sensor that sends electrical signals to an LED",0
169,"With this sensor, patients can transmit their health information in real-time using the embedded wireless antenna in the lens",0
169,"In the study, the research team has successfully tested their prototype lens on a live rabbit via non-invasive in-vivo testing",0
169,The rabbit showed no signs of abnormal behaviour during repeated eye blinks and the LED pixel turned off when tear fluids with glucose concentration were over the threshold,0
169,"In addition, during the wireless operations, this smart contact lens could still maintain the eye temperature stably without abrupt heating",1
169,"""These smart contact lenses are made of transparent nanomaterials and therefore do not obstruct the wearer's view,"" said Jihun Park, first author of the study published in the journal Science Advances",0
169,"""Besides, because the system uses a wireless antenna to read sensor information, no separate power source, like a battery is required for the smart contact lens sensors,"" Park said",0
169,"""Our smart contact lens provides a platform for wireless, continuous, and noninvasive monitoring of physiological conditions, as well as the detection of biomarkers associated with ocular and other diseases,"" said Park",0
169,"""It also offers the potential for expanded applicability in other areas, such as smart devices for drug delivery and augmented reality,"" he said",0

171,"NEW DELHI: The annual holiday festival of colours, Holi, is less than a week away, and as usual, we can expect the traditional promises to be made of renewed friendship, forgiveness for sins committed in the recent past, and a fun-filled day of frolic marked by a splashing of coloured powder, water and balloons, and a chanting ""Holi Hai""",0
171,"Traditionally spring flowers, berries, spices and other plants were used for making coloured Gulal and wet colours from flowers like hibiscus etc",0
171,"There is no doubt that Holi is one of the popular festivals of India, but there are dangers too associated with the event such as the blatant use of expensive, artificial and bright colours made with the help of chemical solvents and toxic agents like the lead oxide,mercury sulphite and copper sulphate etc",0
171,"These can damage eyes, skin and lungs, says beauty expert Shahnaz Husain

But again, all of us love this carnival of colours, and according to Husain, can enjoy the festival with the use of organic and home-made colours",0
171,These are available in markets but cost more,0
171,It is essential to take appropriate safety steps to prevent your skin or hair from getting damaged,0
171,The dry “Gulal” and the wet colours of today are not derived from natural sources,0
171,"They contain chemicals, shiny particles of mica and even lead, which not only irritate the skin, but collect on the scalp",0
171,"Since Holi is played outdoors, exposure to the sun can have a detrimental effect on the skin",0
171,"Apart from harmful UV radiation, sun-exposure makes the skin dry by causing depletion of moisture and also tans the skin",0
171,The skin can become dry and dull after playing Holi,0
171,"What, therefore, are the preventives?

Husain advises one and all to apply sunscreen 20 minutes before going out in the sun",0
171,“Use a sunscreen of SPF 20 and above,0
171,"If your skin is prone to pigmented patches, select a higher SPF",0
171,Most sunscreens have built-in moisturizers,0
171,"If your skin is very dry, first apply the sunscreen, wait for a few minutes and then apply a moisturizer",1
171,"Apply moisturising lotion or cream on the arms and exposed areas,” she says",0
171,"For the hair, apply leave-on conditioner or hair serum",1
171,“This protects the hair from the effects of sun exposure and dryness caused by colours,0
171,Hair cream containing sunscreen is also available,0
171,"Take very little, spread on both palms and massage light into the hair, or smooth palms over the hair",0
171,"Or, apply pure coconut oil and massage it lightly into the hair",0
171,"This also provides protection against colours,” Husain said",0
171,Apply transparent nail varnish on the nails,0
171,This helps to protect nails from absorbing Holi colours,1
171,"When it comes to removal of colours, rinse the face with plenty of plain water and then use a cleansing cream or lotion",1
171,Then wipe off with moist cotton wool,0
171,"Remember to cleanse the area around the eyes too, using a light touch",0
171,A cleansing gel helps to dissolve the colours and facilitates their removal,0
171,"“To make your own cleanser, take half a cup of cold milk and add one teaspoon of any vegetable oil, like “til,” olive or sunflower oil",0
171,Mix well,0
171,Dip cotton wool into this mixture and use it to cleanse the skin,0
171,"Sesame seed (til) oil can be used to remove colours from the body, massaging it on the skin",0
171,"This not only helps to remove the colours, but gives added protection to the skin",0
171,"Sesame seed (til) oil actually helps to counteract sun-damage,” the beauty expert said",0
171,"While bathing, scrub the body gently with a loofah or wash cloth",0
171,"Immediately after your bath, apply a moisturizer on the face and body, while the skin is still damp",0
171,This helps to seal in moisture,0
171,"If there is itching, add two tablespoons vinegar to a mug of water and use it as a last rinse",0
171,This helps to reduce itching,0
171,"However, if the itching continues, and there is rash and redness, there may be an allergic reaction to the colour",0
171,Consult a doctor as soon as possible,0
171,"While washing the hair, first rinse with plenty of plain water to wash away the dry colours and tiny particles of mica",1
171,"Then apply a mild herbal shampoo, working it into the hair with the fingers",0
171,Massage the scalp gently and rinse thoroughly with water again,0
171,Beer can be used as a last rinse,0
171,"In fact, it will soften and condition the hair",0
171,Add the juice of a lemon to the beer,0
171,Pour over the hair after shampoo,0
171,Leave on for a few minutes and rinse off with plain water,0
171,"The day after Holi, mix two tablespoons of honey with half-a-cup of curd",0
171,Add a pinch of turmeric,0
171,"Apply this on the face, neck and arms",0
171,Leave it on for 20 minutes and wash off with water,0
171,This helps to remove the tan and soften the skin,0
171,"Over the next few days, give your hair nourishment by mixing one tablespoon of pure coconut oil with one teaspoon of castor oil",0
171,“Heat and apply on the hair,0
171,"Then dip a towel in hot water, squeeze out the water and wrap the hot towel around the head, like a turban",0
171,Keep it on for five minutes,0
171,Repeat the hot towel wrap three to four times,0

172,WASHINGTON: Scientists have identified a drug that extends egg viability in worms and could theoretically extend women's fertility by three to six years,1
172,"""As early as the mid-30s, women start to experience declines in fertility, increased rates of miscarriage and maternal age-related birth defects,"" said Coleen Murphy from the Princeton University in the US",0
172,"""All of these problems are thought to be caused by declining egg quality, rather than a lack of eggs,"" said Murphy",1
172,"The researchers used a microscopic worm, Caenorhabditis elegans (C elegans), to study longevity",1
172,"For the study, published in the journal Current Biology, they investigated downregulated group of proteins, cathepsin B proteases, that are rare in high-quality eggs and more common in eggs that have begun degrading with age",0
172,The existence of drugs that block these exact proteins provided an opportunity to test their effects,0
172,Another experiment that knocked out the cathepsin B genes entirely succeeded in extending worms fertility by about 10 percent,1
172,"""If applied to humans, it could be a three- to six-year extension of your reproductive period,"" said Nicole Templeman from Princeton University",0

173,"Soon, a middle-aged man came up and said, “How did you come up with this idea?”

Swadha felt embarrassed and said, “This stall is only for women",0
173,"”

The man said, “You are being discriminatory",0
173,"You can tell men, too",0
173,"” Later, when Swadha told Mata Amritanandamayi about this, the latter said, “There is no problem in talking about pads with a man",0

173,“It is a naturally occurring absorbent with medicinal properties,0
173,Nobody has used banana fibres to make reusable pads,1
173,"Amma wanted us to do this,” says Anju Bist, co-director, Amrita SeRVe",0
173,"Apart from providing a means of personal hygiene to women, these pads have become a source of income for rural women, who manufacture them under the guidance of Mata Amritanandmayi",0
173,"First, the stalk is cut",0
173,"Then it is put into an extractor machine, where it is converted into thin strips",0
173,“These have to be washed in baking soda to make them softer,0
173,"Then, they are dried in the sun for five days before being given to the village women who convert them into pads,” says Anju",0
173,The advantage of these pads is that they can be washed and reused,0
173,"“Also, since they are highly absorbent, a working woman does not have to change a pad for at least eight hours",1
173,"Moreover, there is an urgent need for such pads because disposable sanitary ones have been causing damage to the environment,” says Anju",0
173,"Here are the statistics: During her menstrual cycle over a lifetime, a woman will discard anywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 pads",0
173,"“There are 360 million women, who are of menstruating age, in India,” says Swadha",0
173,"“If, on an average, they use 12 to15 pads per menstrual cycle it will add up to 432 million soiled pads that weigh 900 tonne and are enough to fill 320 football fields",0

Another attractive quality of Saukhyam is that it is available in different colours",0
173,"“We want people to buy their pads as if they are buying clothes,” says Deepa H, a staff member of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham",0
173,The prices range between Rs 200 and Rs 2000 depending on whether you are buying individual day/night pads or in packs,0

178,"If you're someone who enjoys training at home, full body workouts make for a good option",0
178,"Here are some full body exercises as suggested by Puneet Rehani, Physiotherapist at AktivHealth:

- Brisk Walking: Brisk walking is simple yet powerful",0
178,"It can help to improve cholesterol levels, strengthen bones, keep blood pressure in check and lift your mood",0
178,"- Squatting: Squats are one of the best functional exercises that train primarily the muscles of the thighs, burn fat, prevent injuries, improve sports performance and along with that trigger the release of testosterone and human growth hormone in your body",0
178,"The proper way to begin is to keep your back straight, feet spread apart about shoulder length with both arms extended, knees over the ankles and then go downward with your butt just touching the chair; then return to your original standing position",0
178,"- Pull-Ups: Pull-ups are an excellent exercise for strengthening your neck, back, shoulders, chest and arms, improving posture and building grip strength",1
178,"Stand underneath the pull up bar, place your hands on the bar with your palms facing you",0
178,Lift yourself upward and hold yourself slightly over the bar,0
178,"Keep your elbows bend, and your chin over the bar",0
178,Slowly come down to the starting position,0
178,"- Push-Ups: Push-ups are a compound exercise that involves your arms, shoulders, chest, back, abdominals and even your legs",1
178,"This exercise can be used for quick high-intensity routine for calorie-burning, if weight loss is your goal",0
178,Lie down on your tummy,0
178,Keep your feet together,0
178,Your weight should be on your chest,0
178,"Position hands palms-down on the floor, approximately shoulder width apart",0
178,"Slowly raise your body, straighten your arms, hold this position for few seconds and slowly come back to original position",1
178,"- Planks: The plank is one of the best exercises because it tightens the deepest core muscles which in turn help to improve strength, balance, co-ordination and most importantly back pain",0
178,"Place the forearms on the ground with the elbows aligned below the shoulders, and arms parallel to the body at about shoulder-width distance",1
178,"“Before starting these exercises, make sure they are performed under professional guidance with targeted number of repetitions and sets as per your fitness goals and health conditions,” Rehani concluded",0
179,"WASHINGTON: Patients may score slightly lower on certain memory tests after undergoing surgery, a study suggests",1
179,The study published in the journal Anaesthesia involved 312 participants who had surgery and 652 participants who had not (with an average age in the 50s),0
179,"Surgery between tests was associated with a decline in immediate memory by one point out of a possible maximum test score of 30 points, researchers said",1
179,"Memory became abnormal in 77 out of 670 participants with initially normal memory comprising 18 per cent of those who had had surgery compared with 10 per cent of those who had not, they said",0
179,"""The cognitive changes we report are highly statistically significant in view of the internal normative standards we employ, and the large sample size of the control, or non-surgery, population,"" said Kirk Hogan from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US",0
179,"""However, the cognitive changes after surgery are small - most probably asymptomatic and beneath a person's awareness,"" said Hogan",1
179,No differences in other measures of memory and executive function were observed between participants having and not having surgery,1
179,Reduced immediate memory scores at the second visit were significantly associated with the number of operations in the preceding nine years,0
179,"Working memory decline was associated with longer cumulative operations, researchers said",0
179,"""The results await confirmation both in follow-up investigations in our own population sample after more surgeries in aging participants, and by other investigators with other population samples,"" said Hogan",0
179,"He noted that it is too early to recommend any changes in clinical practice regarding prevention, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of cognitive changes after surgery",1
180,"LONDON: Sipping wine may be good for your oral health, say scientists who found that certain compounds in the drink can fend of harmful bacteria in the teeth and gums",1
180,"Traditionally, some health benefits of polyphenols have been attributed to the fact that these compounds are antioxidants, meaning they likely protect the body from harm caused by free radicals",0
180,"However, recent work indicates polyphenols might also promote health by actively interacting with bacteria in the gut",1
180,Plants and fruits produce polyphenols to ward off infection by harmful bacteria and other pathogens,0
180,"Researchers including M Victoria Moreno-Arribas from Institute of Food Science Research (CIAL) in Spain wanted to know whether wine and grape polyphenols would also protect teeth and gums, and how this could work on a molecular level",0
180,"The study, published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, checked out the effect of two red wine polyphenols, as well as commercially available grape seed and red wine extracts, on bacteria that stick to teeth and gums and cause dental plaque, cavities and periodontal disease",1
180,"Working with cells that model gum tissue, they found that the two wine polyphenols in isolation - caffeic and p-coumaric acids - were generally better than the total wine extracts at cutting back on the bacteria's ability to stick to the cells",1
180,"When combined with the Streptococcus dentisani, which is believed to be an oral probiotic, the polyphenols were even better at fending off the pathogenic bacteria",1
180,The researchers also showed that metabolites formed when digestion of the polyphenols begins in the mouth might be responsible for some of these effects,0
181,"NEW YORK: The longer a person spends being obese, the higher is the risk of a ""silent"" heart damage, finds a study, which says ""the number of overweight or obese years may ""add up"" to the risk",1
181,"The findings showed that for each 10 years that a person spends being obese, the risk of having high levels of troponin -- a protein linked with heart damage -- increased 1",1
181,"25 times, even when accounting for heart disease risk due to high blood pressure, diabetes and kidney disease",1
181,Troponin is released when the heart muscle has been damaged,0
181,"The more damage there is to the heart, the greater will be the amount of troponin in the blood",1
181,"Thus, maintaining a healthy weight across the lifespan is important for keeping the heart healthy and minimising damage as people age, the researchers said",0
181,"""We're finding that people's weight from age 25 onwards is linked to the risk of more or less heart damage, as measured by levels of the protein troponin, later in life, which underscores the likely importance of long-term weight control for reducing heart disease risk,"" said Chiadi Ndumele, Assistant Professor at the Johns Hopkins University",0
181,"""The study suggests that even in the absence of such heart disease risk factors as high blood pressure, diabetes or kidney disease, the number of years spent obese or overweight contributes to the higher likelihood of heart damage,"" Ndumele added",1
181,"For the study, appearing in the journal Clinical Chemistry, the team examined 9,062 participants, four times over a period of 10-11 years",0
181,Those who increased their body mass index (BMI) to the overweight and obesity range at the fourth visit were 1,0
181,"5 times more likely to have increased troponin levels of at least 14 nanograms per litre, indicating heart damage",0
181,"On average, each 100 extra BMI-years increased the likelihood, or risk, of increased troponin by 21 per cent, Ndumele said",1
182,"NEW YORK: Modern humans have brains that are more than three times larger than our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, and we have the gradual increase in brain size of our ancestors over the past three million years to thank for that, a new study says",0
182,"The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, involved an analysis of 94 hominin fossils",1
182,"It showed that brain size increased gradually and consistently, driven by evolution within populations, introduction of larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-brained ones",1
182,"""Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that makes us human",1
182,"It's related to cultural complexity, language, tool making and all these other things that make us unique,"" said Andrew Du from the University of Chicago and first author of the study",0
182,"""The earliest hominins had brain sizes like chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since then",1
182,"So, it's important to understand how we got here,"" Du added",0
182,"The researchers compared published research data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13 different species, beginning with the earliest unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3",0
182,"2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size began to overlap with that of modern-day humans",0
182,"The researchers saw that when the species were counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a common ancestor, the average brain size increased gradually over three million years",0
182,"The increase was driven by three different factors, primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within individual species populations, but also by the addition of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-brained ones, the study said",0
182,"""The conventional wisdom was that our large brains had evolved because of a series of step-like increases each one making our ancestors smarter",1
182,"Not surprisingly the reality is more complex, with no clear link between brain size and behaviour,"" said Bernard Wood, Professor at George Washington University and senior author of the study",0
183,"WASHINGTON: Heavy drinking can increase your risk of early-onset dementia, according to the largest study of its kind ever conducted",1
183,It looked over one million adults diagnosed with dementia in France,0
183,"The research looked specifically at the effect of alcohol use disorders, and included people who had been diagnosed with mental and behavioural disorders or chronic diseases that were attributable to chronic harmful use of alcohol",0
183,"Of the 57,000 cases of early-onset dementia (before the age of 65), the majority (57%) were related to chronic heavy drinking",1
183,The World Health Organization (WHO) defines chronic heavy drinking as consuming more than 60 grams pure alcohol on average per day for men and 40 grams per day for women,0
183,"As a result of the strong association found in this study, the authors suggest that screening, brief interventions for heavy drinking, and treatment for alcohol use disorders should be implemented to reduce the alcohol-attributable burden of dementia",0
183,"""The findings indicate that heavy drinking and alcohol use disorders are the most important risk factors for dementia, and especially important for those types of dementia which start before age 65, and which lead to premature deaths,"" says study co-author Dr",0
183,Jürgen Rehm,0
183,"""Alcohol-induced brain damage and dementia are preventable, and known-effective preventive and policy measures can make a dent into premature dementia deaths",0
183,"""

Dr",0
183,"Rehm points out that on average, alcohol use disorders shorten life expectancy by more than 20 years, and dementia is one of the leading causes of death for these people",0
183,"For early-onset dementia, there was a significant gender split",0
183,"While the overall majority of dementia patients were women, almost two-thirds of all early-onset dementia patients (64",1
183,9%) were men,1
183,"Alcohol use disorders were also associated with all other independent risk factors for dementia onset, such as tobacco smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, lower education, depression, and hearing loss, among modifiable risk factors",0
183,It suggests that alcohol use disorders may contribute in many ways to the risk of dementia,1
183,"""As a geriatric psychiatrist, I frequently see the effects of alcohol use disorder on dementia, when unfortunately alcohol treatment interventions may be too late to improve cognition,"" says CAMH Vice-President of Research Dr",0
183,Bruce Pollock,0
183,"""Screening for and reduction of problem drinking, and treatment for alcohol use disorders need to start much earlier in primary care",0
183,"""

The authors also noted that only the most severe cases of alcohol use disorder - ones involving hospitalization - were included in the study",0
183,"This could mean that, because of ongoing stigma regarding the reporting of alcohol-use disorders, the association between chronic heavy drinking and dementia may be even stronger",1
183,The findings have been published in The Lancet Public Health journal,0
184,"WASHINGTON: According to a study, the stigma of Multiple Sclerosis can increase the risk of depression in the patients",1
184,The researchers added that having a support system of friends and family and a sense of autonomy may help reduce the harmful effects of stigma,0
184,"As part of an ongoing research project, people living with MS who reported higher levels of stigma also reported more symptoms of depression and were more likely to meet the thresholds for clinical depression",0
184,"By using a longitudinal methodology, which gathers data from the same people over time, the researchers conclude that stigma is likely to be a cause of depression",1
184,"Researchers have known for some time that people with MS have high rates of depression, but had limited data on why depression rates were so high, said Margaret Cadden, a doctoral student in psychology at Penn State and lead author of the study",0
184,"""About 50 percent of people with MS will have depression during their lifetime compared to 17 percent of the general public, but the causes of these high rates of depression in MS are not well understood,"" said Cadden",0
184,"""Our study helps identify stigma as an important social contributor",0
184,"""

Stigma is the experience of being set apart and seen as less than others because of a personal characteristic or group membership, according to the researchers",0
184,"""Research suggests that having a chronic illness can make people feel isolated, separated and judged,"" said Cadden",0
184,"""People living with MS know that they have a disease that's currently incurable, and that often brings a host of symptoms that may contribute to people becoming stigmatized",0
184,"""

Symptoms of MS include motor impairment, visual problems, fatigue, pain, speech problems and cognitive difficulties, added Cadden",0
184,"Having stronger social bonds can create a psychological buffer that may help alleviate some of stigma's negative effects, said Jonathan Cook, assistant professor of psychology, Penn State, and the study's senior author",0
184,"""We found that people with greater psychosocial reserve -- that is, their sense of having a support network and a sense of belonging, and being able to advocate for their needs -- were less affected by stigma,"" said Cook",0
184,"""They were less likely to be depressed even if they experienced stigma",0
184,"""

The researchers suggest that the study on the link between stigma and depression in MS patients may shine a light on the role stigma plays in depression for patients who are suffering from other illnesses and conditions",0
184,"Stigma is often connected with conditions where personal responsibility is thought to play a role, for example, HIV and drug abuse",0
184,"However, the researchers said that the findings suggest that stigma may play a role in causing depression among people who suffer from other conditions that have little involvement with personal responsibility, like MS",0
184,"""Personal responsibility is thought to intensify stigma,"" said Cook",0
184,"""Research on stigma from chronic illness has often focused on conditions like HIV and lung cancer, where stigma can be based in part on people's sense that the illness might have been prevented",0
184,"So, there is a perspective where you might wonder how much stigma would be a problem for people living with MS",0
184,"And the reality we're finding is that it is an issue, and that it worsens depression",0
184,"""

The researchers used data from 5,369 participants enrolled in the semi-annual survey conducted by the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis -- NARCOMS -- a registry of people living with MS who are surveyed twice per year",0
184,NARCOMS is sponsored by the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers,0
184,"""One of the biggest contributions of this research is testing the association between stigma and depression longitudinally,"" said Cook",1
184,"""Very little research on stigma, in general, and chronic illnesses like MS in particular, has examined the consequences of stigma over time",0
184,"By testing how stigma affects depression longitudinally, we're better able to separate out cause and effect",1
184,"""

The researchers also controlled for a list of other factors, such as gender, the extent of impairment caused by MS, smoking and physical activity",0
184,The findings have been published in the journal Social Science & Medicine,0
185,"TORONTO: A new gene that helps grow blood vessels when it senses inadequate blood flow to tissues has been identified, an advance that can help improve treatments for heart diseases and stroke",1
185,"STEEL (for spliced-transcript endothelial-enriched lncRNA), was one of the genes in a newly described group of genes called long non-coding RNAs, or lncRNAs that was found to sense inadequate blood flow in microscopic blood vessels",1
185,"The findings could help scientists better understand cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and strokes, which result from inadequate blood flow",1
185,It could also lead to advances in efforts to grow replacement organs or to block blood vessels in tumours,1
185,"""What is really interesting is that STEEL helps our body respond to inadequate blood flow by growing more blood vessels,"" said Jeffrey Man, a researcher at St",1
185,Michael's Hospital in Canada,1
185,"""These results show that our bodies are really finely tuned to perform, just as we need them to, and also demonstrate that disruptions to this fine balance can cause problems""



""The data can be used to improve our understanding of blood vessel diseases and help us find ways to improve healing and recovery after injury,"" Man said",0
185,"RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is found in all cells and it has traditionally been thought that its main job was to carry instructions from the genes in DNA to make proteins",0
185,"But lncRNAs have other roles, including determining the eventual function that individual cells will play in an organism",0
185,Studying lncRNAs gives researchers opportunities to find new markers and tests to help make diagnoses for patients,0
186,"NEW YORK: Scientists have identified four viruses that can produce insulin-like hormones that are active on human cells, thereby opening up possibilities of revealing biological mechanisms that may cause diabetes or cancer",1
186,"Every cell in the body responds to the hormone insulin, and if that process starts to fail, you get diabetes",0
186,"By analysing large public research databases that hold viral genomic sequences, the researchers found that various viruses can produce peptides that are similar in whole or in part to 16 human hormones and regulatory proteins",0
186,"""We show that these viral insulin-like peptides can act on human and rodent cells,"" said the study's lead author Emrah Altindis of the Joslin Diabetes Centre, a non-profit institution affiliated with Harvard Medical School",0
186,"""We hope that studying these processes will help us to better understand the role of microbes in human disease,"" Altindis said",0
186,"The viruses, detailed in the study published in the journal PNAS, were from a family of viruses known to infect fish",1
186,"To find out if they could be active in mammals, the researchers chemically synthesised these viral insulin-like peptides (VILPs)",1
186,"Experimenting in mouse and human cells, the scientists studied whether the VILPs could act like hormones",0
186,Their experiments proved that the VILPs could indeed bind to human insulin receptors and receptors for a closely-related hormone called IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1),0
186,These are the critical proteins on the cells that tell them to take up glucose and to grow,0
186,"Additionally, the peptides could stimulate all of the signalling pathways inside the cells that were stimulated by human insulin and IGF-1",0
186,"And mice injected with the viral peptides exhibited lower levels of blood glucose, another sign of insulin action",0
186,"Moreover, analysis of databases of viruses found in the human intestine showed evidence that humans are exposed to these viruses, the study said",1
186,"""Indeed, the discovery of the viral insulin-like hormones raises the question of what their role might be in diabetes, as well as autoimmune disease, cancer and other metabolic conditions,"" said study senior author C",0
186,"Ronald Kahn, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School",0
186,"""What really caught our attention were four viruses that had insulin-like sequences,"" Kahn said",0
186,The scientists now will broaden their search for other viruses that produce human-like hormones,0
186,"""We certainly expect to find many more viral hormones, including more viral insulins, in the future,"" Kahn said",1
187,"TORONTO: Improving how mental health patients perceive themselves can be critical in treating them, a first of its kind study has claimed",1
187,"The findings of the study suggest that youths with psychiatric disorders, currently receiving inpatient services, reported lower self-concept, particularly global self-worth, compared to those receiving outpatient services",1
187,"""This was the first study that examined youth with psychiatric disorder by comparing what type of service they were receiving and whether that was associated with self-concept,"" said Mark Ferro, Assistant Professor at the University of Waterloo",0
187,"""We know that global self-worth is lower in the inpatient group and we know from other research that lower self-concept is a precursor to other more serious mental health problems,"" Ferro said",1
187,"For the study, published in the Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, researchers examined a group of youth aged between 8-17 years who were receiving inpatient and outpatient psychiatric services",0
187,The participants' self-concept was measured using the Self-Perception Profile for Children and Adolescents,0
187,"According to the researchers, self-concept might be an important aspect to consider when implementing treatment programmes to improve the mental health of youth who are hospitalised",1
187,"""Because youths who are in the inpatient service have a lower self-concept, therapies within their overall treatment program aiming to improve self-worth might be worthwhile,"" the researcher noted",1
188,"LONDON: Even a few minutes of light exercise daily, such as gentle gardening or taking the dog for a walk, can help the elderly live longer, suggests new research",1
188,"""(The) results suggest that all activities, however modest, are beneficial",0
188,"The finding that (low intensity physical activity) is associated with lower risk of mortality is especially important among older men, as most of their daily physical activity is of light intensity,"" said the researchers led by Barbara Jefferis of University College London",1
188,"Clocking 150 minutes of weekly physical activity of any level, even if accumulated in short bouts, might be critical, suggest the findings published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine",0
188,Current exercise guidelines recommend accumulating at least 150 minutes a week of moderate to vigorous physical activity in bouts lasting 10 or more minutes,1
188,"But such a pattern is not always easy for older adults to achieve, the researchers said",0
188,"To find out if other patterns of activity might still contribute to lowering the risk of death, the researchers drew on data from the British Regional Heart Study",0
188,"The final analysis of the study was based on more than 1,000 men, whose average age was 78",0
188,They were asked to wear an accelerometer -- a portable gadget that continuously tracks the volume and intensity of physical activity -- during waking hours for seven days,1
188,"During the monitoring period, which averaged around five years, 194 of the men died",0
188,"The accelerometer findings indicated that total volume of physical activity, from light intensity upwards, was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause",1
188,"Each additional 30 minutes a day of light intensity activity was associated with a 17 per cent reduction in the risk of death, the study said",0
188,"While the equivalent reduction in the risk of death was around 33 per cent for each additional 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity a day, the benefits of light intensity activity were large enough to mean that this too might prolong life",0
188,"And there was no evidence to suggest that clocking up moderate to vigorous activity in bouts of 10 minutes or more was better than accumulating it in shorter bouts, the study said",0
189,"KOCHI: A seminar on ‘the science of natural healing’ was held here with Dr Arun Sharma, a pioneer in naturopathy addressing the crowd",1
189,The seminar organised by the Indian institute of Mahayoga and Sree Ramakrishna Sevashram focused on the benefits of the alternate form of medicine,1
189,"“In our concept, we don’t focus on the disease",0
189,We focus on the body and the overall well-being,1
189,"The physical, mental and spiritual health is one",0
189,"To maintain all the three, the focus should be given to the overall well-being,” said Sharma, International Institute of Mahayoga director and naturopathy practitioner",1
189,“The very crux of natural care is self-care and quality living along with maintaining the overall health of a person can prevent the onset of ailments,1
189,"A healthy diet and lifestyle can help build immunity to all these diseases and can also help a person recover,” he said",0
189,"The seminar also focused on subjects like ‘check one’s habit and not the body’, ‘ focus on health and not on disease’, ‘rejuvenating the body’ and a ‘new understanding of cancer’",0
189,Sharma is a pioneer in the field and he wants people here to have access to such knowledge,0
190,KOCHI: Christmas is always the perfect time for family reunions,1
190,"Sara Thomas eagerly awaited the arrival of the families of her doctor son , Jacob from the US and daughter, Meena from the UK",0
190,But somehow this year even the bright smiles of grandchildren could not reduce the pain in her joints and the breathlessness which was making it difficult even to walk short distances,0
190,"For the last few months, her husband, Dr Thomas had consulted various colleagues who were trying their best, subtly putting the blame on her crossing the 70th year milestone also",0
190,Sara was somehow not convinced how she could become 15- 20 years weaker in a span of a few months,0
190,"Jacob who was my classmate, also noticed this and called me on December 24 and we chalked out a plan after Christmas",1
190,"When our team first saw Sara after admission on December 26, there was no doubt that she had a serious, possibly life threatening illness",0
190,"Haemoglobin was just 6 gm % , ESR more than 100 and the Oxygen levels in the blood maintained only with supplemental oxygen",0
190,"It was a wonder how an experienced and senior doctor like her husband could miss the evolving danger, blaming most of the symptoms on rheumatism and ageing",0
190,We see this quite often in cancer cases because mind has the strange capacity to mask reality and rely on false hopes when the danger seems too big! CT scan confirmed that there were several masses in the lung and we immediately performed a biopsy from one,0
190,"A brave woman, Sara also agreed for a bone marrow biopsy the very next day in view of low counts",0
190,"As her condition was deteriorating, we speed tracked the reports within three days",0
190,"In the multidisciplinary meeting, the radiologist had no doubt about the shadows being of lung cancer",1
190,Pathologist named the same as adenocarcinoma of lung,0
190,The surprise came when the haematologist put up the bone marrow slides showing Acute Leukemia,0
190,Breaking bad news is a routine for us clinicians in cancer care,0
190,We try to focus on the good points even in an incurable cancer,0
190,But Sara was a unique one with two serious issues diagnosed together,0
190,"As I knew the family well, there was an open discussion about the expected outcomes",0
190,The main aim we kept was to reduce her symptoms and prolong life span,0
190,Usually oncologists avoid answering the How Long? Question,0
190,"As a friend, I told Jacob “few months”, BUT",0
190,"As Sara was a retired college professor, she also wanted clarity about the issues",0
190,"With a smiling face she agreed to go through the treatment, leaving the rest to God",0
190,Being deeply religious surely helped her to face the illness with confidence,0
190,"Sara’s lung cancer was driven by a genetic mutation in EGFR domain which makes the cells to divide without control, leading to cancer",1
190,"In such cases,a simple tablet, Geftinib or Afatinib can block this mutation, arresting cancer growth",0
190,"The leukemia was also amenable to control through a new class of drugs, Azacytidine which again modified the DNA of cancer cells",0
190,Both of these could be called as “designer drugs “which are being increasingly used in Oncology,0
190,They target the cancer cells specifically,0
190,Collateral damage to normal tissues which causes side effects of chemotherapy are minimal with these drugs,0
190,"As these can be taken at home, Sara was discharged",0
190,"Within a few weeks, there was symptomatic relief",0
190,It is indeed fulfilling when a patient who was critically ill walks in to OP and talks like any other person,0
190,"There was some skin rash, joint pains and she still required blood transfusion, but overall tolerance was good",0
190,"First place she visited was the church and in her words “I had to thank the Lord who gave you the medicines to make me better!”

Jacob and Meena went back and they knew very well that their mother was enjoying a temporary reprieve",0
190,Scans done at 3rd month and 6th month showed that lung cancer had dramatically shrunk,0
190,Blood counts also recovered and we could stop transfusions,0
190,Sara resumed the spoken English classes she was conducting at home,0
190,Then suddenly the fever started,0
190,The fatigue returned and pains increased,0
190,"This time the lesions were there in liver and spleen, lungs mostly normal",0
190,"In a routine case, we would have termed this as cancer progression and advised palliative care",0
190,But Sara was a fighter and she asked us a sharp question- Is it cancer or something else? The liver biopsy confirmed tuberculosis which was a relief as there was a treatable disease now,0
190,"Being immuno compromised due to leukemia, Mrs Sara was prone for developing tuberculosis also",0
190,Jacob had come all the way and he jokingly scolded his mother for raising a false alarm! Maybe this positive spirit in the family was the real drug which seemed to work well for Sara,0
190,Repeat tests confirmed that TB in addition to lung and blood cancer was under control,0
190,Clinical research has shown that EGFR inhibitors work for an average of 1 -1 ½ years and Azacytidine for close to 1 year,0
190,This scientific fact was always nagging me whenever Sara came for review,0
190,"However there were outliers, living for many years and we always want our patients to be among them reaping the exceptional benefits of modern medicine",0
190,We have many such patients who are aware of the inevitable but continue taking treatment with a smiling face,0
190,Their families also play an important role in taking them through this phase,0
190,A year had passed,0
190,Jacob and Meena were planning for an elaborate celebration by inviting their extended family,0
190,"Being a different person, Sara just asked them the budget for the planned function",0
190,The next instruction was very clear- “Give it to the old age home for terminally ill patients”,0
190,"Sure she came to Oncology OP with a home baked cake and has promised me one for next Christmas also!

197,"| Reuters

Most Android phones will have to wait until 2019 to duplicate the 3D sensing feature behind Apple’s Face ID security, three major parts producers have told Reuters, handicapping Samsung and others on a technology that is set to be worth billions in revenue over the next few years",0
197,The development of new features for the estimated 1,0
197,"5 billion smartphones shipped annually has been at the heart of the battle for global market share over the past decade, with Apple, bolstered by its huge R&D budget, often leading",0
197,"When the iPhone 5S launched with a fingerprint-sensing home button in September 2013, for example, it took its biggest rival Samsung until just April of the next year to deliver its own in the Galaxy S5, with others following soon after",0
197,"The 3D sensing technology is expected to enhance the next generation of phones, enabling accurate facial recognition as well as secure biometrics for payments, gesture sensing, and immersive shopping and gaming experiences",1
197,"Tech research house Gartner predicts that by 2021, 40 percent of smartphones will be equipped with 3D cameras, which can also be used for so-called augmented reality, or AR, in which digital objects cling tightly to images of the real world",0
197,"""This kind of functionality is going to be very important for AR,"" said Gartner analyst Jon Erensen",0
197,"""I think that is something where you don't want to get left behind",0
197,"""

According to parts manufacturers Viavi Solutions Inc, Finisar Corp and Ams AG, bottlenecks on key parts will mean mass adoption of 3D sensing will not happen until next year, disappointing earlier expectations",0
197,"That means that China's Huawei, Xiaomi and others could be a total of almost two years behind Apple, which launched Face ID with its iPhone X anniversary phone last September",0
197,"In particular, Android producers are struggling to source vertical-cavity-surface-emitting lasers, or VCSELs, a core part of Apple's Face ID hardware",0
197,"""It is going to take them a lot of time, the Android-based customers, to secure capacity throughout the whole supply chain,"" said Bill Ong, senior director of investor relations from Viavi, seen as the only major supplier of optical filters needed for the 3D sensing modules",0
197,"""We may have a potential introduction of a second handset maker into 3D sensing at the end of this calendar year",1
197,(But) the volumes would be very low,0
197,"In 2019 you clearly will see at least two or more Android-based phones,"" he added",0
197,Ong declined to name the company that might launch an Android phone with 3D face recognition this year but said that Viavi was in talks with all the major smartphone makers to supply the filters,0
197,"Some Android phones with 3D sensing capabilities have hit the market in small numbers, such as the Asus ZenFone AR released last year, but those models didn’t use the sensors for facial recognition like the iPhone X does",0
197,"Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi all declined to comment, as did Samsung, whose current phones use a standard camera for facial recognition",0
197,"FIREPOWER

Apple's effort to get ahead with the technology is the latest evidence of an aggressive approach by the Cupertino-based company to making the most of the technological advances its financial firepower can deliver",0
197,The iPhone maker's $390 million deal in December to secure supplies from VCSEL-maker Finisar was one such move,0
197,Another is Apple's discussions with major cobalt producers to nail down supplies for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries that power its mobile phones,0
197,"""Apple is always very focused on its supply chain,"" says Gartner's Erensen",0
197,"""When it comes to new technologies like this and implementing them to new phones, it's one of the ways that Apple can really can be aggressive, differentiate and take advantage of the position they have in the market",0
197,"""

Several sector analysts say their channel checks show Apple was initially sourcing VCSELs chiefly from California-based Lumentum and that bottlenecks in production there last year also spurred the $390 million deal with Finisar",0
197,"Lumentum, which declined to comment, is ramping up additional manufacturing capacity for VCSELs and edge-emitting lasers for the first half of fiscal 2019, according to the company's earnings call",0
197,It will also be helped by the purchase this week of another optical components producer Oclaro Inc,0
197,Finisar too expects to expand in 2019,0
197,"All of that, however, still leaves the major Android producers searching for their own supplies of VCSELs",1
197,"Craig Thompson, vice president of new markets at Finisar, says interest in the technology is universal across the sector",0
197,"""Each customer has their own adoption timeline and rollout plan, which we can’t discuss, but we expect the market opportunity for VCSEL technology to increase substantially in 2019,"" he says",1
197,"Another producer, Austria-based Ams, also expects to have VCSEL chips widely available next year and says it has won a large deal with one phone maker",0
197,"""As part of a combined external and internal VCSEL supply chain where an external volume production supply chain is available to us, we are currently building internal VCSEL production capacity in Singapore,"" Moritz Gmeiner, head of investor relations for AMS, told Reuters",0
197,"""I expect this capacity to be available for mass production next year",0

209,"City Express got in touch with him on how he got started, and about how being an emotionally strong person has helped him deal with the touching stories he hears on a daily basis",0
209,"Here’s an excerpt of the conversation we had with him:



How did you get started on The Artidote?

In practical terms, The Artidote was launched on Facebook on May 15, 2015",0
209,It was an evolutionary step from a pilot project I had been working on for over a year (Berlin Artparasites) that acquired quite the traction on social media,1
209,"In non-practical terms, The Artidote began when I was a ten-year- old Mexican immigrant now living in the US",0
209,I was bullied in school for being different and not knowing the language or the new social structures,0
209,"Not having the proper tools to communicate my feelings, expressing myself through art became my only means of connecting with others",0
209,It was my way to tell stories when I didn’t have a voice,0
209,"Creating bonds through storytelling, visual and textual, is still one of the foundational pillars of The Artidote",0
209,"Why did you decide to move on from Berlin Art Parasites?

After a year of being a community manager for the Berlin-based online magazine, I realised that I had stumbled upon something much bigger than what my job description there entailed",0
209,"I felt that, in order to make my dreams reach their full potential, I needed to have 100% creative control over the platform and community I had begun to build",0
209,The Artidote became a natural evolution into something bigger,0
209,"It offered me the fertile ground where to expand my creative ideas revolving my passions for storytelling, social media, psychology and philanthropy",1
209,Your tagline is ‘mental health over every damn thing’,0
209,"To what extent do you think art can help people cope with mental illness?

From personal experience, I can say that practicing any art form is therapeutic in nature",0
209,"Whether it is painting, writing, dance, playing music - any art practitioner will tell you how good it feels to be in that creative zone",0
209,"I have the suspicion that it’s because art allows us to open up a space where to feel what we’re feeling, freely",0
209,"It sounds simple, but having those spaces where to feel openly all your feelings can be very difficult to find",0
209,"And only when we are allowed to feel what we’re feeling, can any sort of healing begin to happen",0
209,You’ve saved lives through social media,1
209,"Do you feel a sense of responsibility towards the millions of people connected to you through The Artidote?

Always",0
209,At first I refused to believe that social media (and what I did with it) had the power to save lives,1
209,But that refusal was mainly due to my fear of the responsibility it brought with it,0
209,I’m no longer afraid,0
209,"I want to lead The Artidote with vulnerable honesty, with the hopes that it inspires as many people as possible along the way",0
209,"There is an unspoken fact that I had to accept a long time ago, however",0
209,And that is the fact that I will not be able to save every single person that comes in contact with The Artidote on any of its channels,0
209,It’s an impossibility and responsibility that no person would ever be able to carry,0
209,"I can only work towards creating a safe, supportive and powerful enough space where to sustain each other and remind ourselves that we are all in this together",0
209,"What was your experience like here in Bengaluru at the Under 25 Summit? Did you ever think you’d create something so powerful that has people coming together across continents?

To be honest—and I don’t think I’ve ever put this on the record—yes",0
209,"Ever since I was a teenager, I dreamt of creating something of impact that had to do with art",0
209,I didn’t know what it was back then,0
209,But life has a way of making things happen when you align yourself in direction of your dreams,0

NEW YORK: When the world shifted from personal computers to smartphones, websites had to slim down to work on smaller screens and slower wireless connections",0
221,A similar shift to voice-centric services is again forcing businesses to rethink how they present information to consumers — and spurring new efforts to help them do so,0
221,"The software company Adobe, for instance, announced on Tuesday a new suite of tools that could help airlines, retailers and other companies create simple voice interfaces for travel and shopping",1
221,"It's not a simple task, since a voice-based digital assistant can't really list dozens of flight options or hundreds of products",0
221,That means companies have to figure out how to winnow down those choices to the travel options or products people are most likely to want — an inherently fraught undertaking,1
221,"The technology is still in its infancy, and Adobe doesn't have any actual corporate partners to showcase yet",0
221,"But its announcement, made in conjunction with a tech show in Barcelona, Spain, shows that voice assistants are becoming important channels for reaching consumers",0
221,Amazon's voice-shopping feature already boils down shopping requests to one or two options and makes buying easy because it already has payment and shipping information for voice-eligible customers,0
221,"But smaller businesses don't have the computing resources and expertise to match that, which is where companies like Adobe come in",1
221,Analyst Carolina Milanesi with Creative Strategies says she's not aware of another service trying to help companies improve how they reach their customers through voice,1
221,"In practice, making voice capabilities useful means anticipating what customers want",0
221,"Travel sites, for instance, let people limit a search to, say, nonstop flights, but that's more cumbersome when they're talking to a service",0
221,"Adobe promises to help narrow those options automatically, so that someone who earns points in United and likes early morning flights might hear only those matches",0
221,"Adobe's new voice service will work with all major voice assistants, not just Amazon's",1
221,"It will limit its analysis to data provided by the particular company people are shopping at, instead of trying to pulling together a more comprehensive personal profile from multiple sources",0
221,That will limit the accuracy of its personalization compared to what Adobe says it could provide,0

222,"""False news is more novel, and people are more likely to share novel information,"" Aral added, explaining why people tend to share more false news",1
222,It is because people can gain attention by being the first to share a previously unknown (but possibly false) information,1
222,"Thus, ""people who share novel information are seen as being in the know"", Aral said",1
222,"Examining this ""novelty hypothesis"", the team found that ""people respond to false news more with surprise and disgust"", whereas true stories produced replies more generally characterised by sadness, anticipation, and trust",0
222,"The effects were more pronounced for false political news (45,000 tweets) than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends or financial information",0

223,"Today’s fathers aren’t just defined as a breadwinner or by their professional credentials, they are now a part of every phase of their kid’s life",0
223,"From quitting to smoking/drinking to desiring to stay at home, fathers have come a long way in India",0
223,"The new term collectively used for this new breed of dad is Penguin Dads, borrowing from the concept from Emperor penguins",1
223,"To understand the rise of penguin dads, e-commerce firm Flipkart has carried out a pan-India survey asking dads how they have progressed post fatherhood",1
223,An online survey finding by Flipkart in partnership with Markelytics Solutions India Pvt,0
223,Ltd shows that Hyderabad dads love spending time with their family,0
223,Hyderabad dads also like to engage their kids in common activities like walking and movies,0
223,“Penguin Dads” - The typical Indian family is full of stereotypes,0
223,"From the time a child wakes up in the morning, the mother is involved in almost all activities such as getting kids ready for school, feeding them, cooking, cleaning, sitting with kids for evening studies, and eventually putting the child to sleep",0
223,"With India’s economy and people prospering in recent decades, however, the Indian family has reformed in novel ways",0
223,Flipkart conducted a survey to study this change in society and discovered the rise of “Penguin Dads” in India,0
223,"The “Penguin Dads” - They are the antithesis of the archetypal Indian Dad, challenging and breaking stereotypes about who does what in the family",0
223,They represent the progressive change in the fatherhood narrative in India,0
223,"What do “Penguin Dads” do?

An increasing number of dads today are engaged in raising their kids, as they are in sharing household chores",0
223,"They change nappies, braid hair, take kids to school, and put them to bed – many doing it without any help from Moms",0
223,"Why “Penguin” Dads?

There aren’t many examples of a more dedicated father on earth than the male penguin",0
223,"The flightless birds raise their new-borns single-handedly, just as female tigers nurture and protect their cubs",0

223,Why do “Penguin Dads” do what they do? - Penguin Dads are not super-dads,0

225,"Guess what! Indians were less interested in knowing what their politicians are doing or what the biggest scams in the country are, no matter how loud TV anchors scream about them",0
225,"Names like Rahul Gandhi or Narendra Modi were nowhere in the list of trending search terms, revealing Internet users are not that keen on national politics",1
225,"Instead, they were more into entertainment, sports and things that have a direct bearing on their everyday lives, such as GST, CBSE results and so forth",0
225,"Also, if there is money to make, that’s not such a bad idea -- the popularity of Bitcoins and mutual funds reveal",0
225,"Movies and sports are the bestsellers!

Leave demonetisation, GST, and Narendra Modi aside",0
225,"In 2017, India’s Internet users were more curious about Bollywood and Cricket than anything else",1

225,"In fact, the top 10 list has nothing other than the names of Bollywood flicks and cricket tournaments",0
225,"While seven of the top 10 search term were names of Bollywood films, the remaining three had to do with Cricket",0

225,A large number of users asked Google how to buy Bitcoins in India,0
225,A lot of them were also curious to know how to mine cryptocurrencies,0
225,These probably have a lot to do with Bitcoins’ sudden popularity,0
225,Cryptocurrency is still vague and a lot of people don't have a clear idea of what they are or how to use them,0

225,"Four of the 10 most popular search terms were related to sports - Indian Premier League, ICC Champions Trophy, Wimbledon and US Open",0

226,"It received many accolades and much acclaim, deservedly so, and proved to be one of my favourite games over the next few years",1
226,"Now, Subset Games is back with their sophomore effort — Into the Breach",1
226,Into the Breach tasks players with fighting off an alien invasion,1
226,"Well, technically the game starts after you fail to fight off an alien invasion",0
226,"However, one pilot uses unreliable technology to transport himself back in time to the beginning of the invasion so that you can try again",0
226,The aliens are unrelenting and pose many obstacles and challenges,0
226,"To meet them, you’re granted command of a squad of mechs with which you face off against them on various grid-based maps",0
226,"Combat is turn-based, and is reminiscent of classic strategy games such as X-COM and the like; and, like many of those gems of yesteryear, is also brutally difficult",0
226,"That’s why, should the aliens prove too strong, you can always choose to abandon the timeline you’re currently playing and open a temporal breach back to the start to try again",1
226,"It’s a neat system, and does soften the blow of failure that more traditional roguelikes deal in by letting you take one of your experienced pilots back with you",0
226,"You also get one chance per battle to reset a turn, and it’s a testament to how challenging this game is that — although that sounds incredibly powerful — in practice it’s barely enough to keep your head out of the water",0
226,"Every round, the aliens telegraph their intentions — maybe this one’s going to target this building while those two try to pincer your artillery unit and the last one’s webbing your frontline brawler so that it can’t move at all",0
226,"Oh, and the game also helpfully shows you where new enemies will spawn in next round too — but don’t worry, if you manage to block a spawn point with an enemy, you’ll buy yourself some breathing room",0
226,The terrain can be used against the aliens as well,0
226,"That’s the beauty of Into the Breach — it gives you so much information and so many tools, and then challenges you to find a way out of the never-ending catastrophe you find yourself in",0
226,"And that’s why this is such an amazing game — you never feel like you lost because of random chance, or the whims of the RNG gods",0
226,"No, you know that you had everything you needed at your disposal in order to succeed (or at least survive) and you messed up",0
226,"That’s all there is to it, soldier — open up another breach and try again",1
226,"Cleverer people than I have described Into the Breach as ‘Pacific Rim meets Edge of Tomorrow’ and ‘kaiju chess’, both of which are phenomenal summaries of the game",0
226,"To which I will only add that Into the Breach is, if anything, more addictive than FTL and is a beautiful many-layered masterpiece that I will likely be coming back to for years",0
226,"If you’d like to

Play XCOM crossed with a Rubik’s Cube

230,"| AP

NEW YORK: Samsung says its new Galaxy S9 phone features a ""reimagined"" camera, and it is indeed pretty darned good",0
230,But you might not want to shell out $720 or more for one just yet unless your current phone is already close to death,0
230,"That's because other high-end phone cameras — nowadays, one of the major differentiators between phones — are also pretty darned good",0
230,"If your phone is recent, it probably already has a decent camera",0
230,Technology has improved to the point that it's really hard to tell the difference between them,0
230,"In many of our test shots, the S9 outperformed the best of its rivals — Apple's iPhone X, Google's Pixel 2 XL and Samsung's own Galaxy Note 8",0
230,Photos had more detail and less distortion,0
230,"But unless you magnify images for closer inspection, usually there's little obvious difference beyond color variation, which comes down to personal preference",0
230,"In a few cases, the S9 performed worse than all three",0
230,The phone comes out March 16 with a U,0
230,S,0
230,starting price of $720 through Samsung and T-Mobile and nearly $800 through other major U,0
230,S,0
230,carriers,0
230,Here's a look at what the S9 offers,0
230,"SEE THE LIGHT

In a first for a major smartphone, the S9 camera has an adjustable aperture, or lens opening, to let in more or less light",0
230,Low-light shots are also improved with software tricks that automatically take 12 shots in quick succession and blend the best of each,0
230,"These changes produce small improvements in shots: The evening sky tends to be darker, with less distortion",0
230,A statue of Abraham Lincoln doesn't look as grainy,0
230,Many S9 shots also have better contrast between dark and light areas,1
230,But these differences are very subtle,0
230,What's more likely to affect picture quality is the steadiness of your hands,0
230,"FREEZING MOTION

The most distinctive feature in Samsung's new camera is super-slow-mo video",0
230,People appear frozen as they jump,0
230,Waterfalls seem at peace as drops trickle down,0
230,The feature offers a fresh perspective on that time-honored prank of having fake snakes pop out of a can — not so scary when the snakes float in thin air,0
230,"It's a gimmick, but loads of fun",0
230,The camera can process only a fifth of a second of video at a time — stretched into six seconds when viewing — so auto detection is key to capturing the right moment,0
230,"It's fun to see people jump up at this speed, but less so when the super-slow-mo part doesn't kick in until they're almost back on the ground",0
230,There's a lot of trial and error involved,0
230,"And compared with still images and regular video, super-slow-mo video tends to be darker and blurrier, particularly with close-ups",0
230,"The feature is at its best outdoors, when lighting is good and the subject in motion is far enough away",0
230,"SAY WHAT?

Samsung's Bixby digital assistant taps the camera for instant translations",0
230,Just point the phone at a sign and see it in English (or your chosen language) with similar fonts and colors,0
230,Bixby was more reliable at picking up text than a similar Google Lens feature on Pixel phones,0
230,"But stop signs in Thai, Portuguese and French were translated as ""first,"" ''shield,"" and ""crazy",0
230,""" Bixby got Indonesian right, though",0
230,And it can deal with long passages in posters and documents,0
230,"YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT

Point the camera at food for nutritional information",0
230,"It gave me close-enough calorie counts for a burger and onion rings, but a roast beef sandwich was misidentified as either a pastrami or a cubano sandwich, depending on the angle",0
230,"All counts are based on single servings, which isn't as useful as Bixby telling me the mac and cheese I had was actually three servings, or triple the calories",0
230,"Unreported calories don't contribute to weight gain, right?

WHAT ELSE

The larger S9 Plus model has a second lens with twice the magnification",0
230,"Though I didn't test this model, a similar feature in other phones is essential for producing better close-ups",0
230,Both S9 models have a feature for turning selfies into personal emojis for sharing in messages,0
230,Some people will love this  I found no use for it,0
230,"Next!

The new phone is easier to unlock by looking at it",0
230,"Past Samsung phones scan your iris, but they don't work reliably in bright sunlight",1
230,"The S9 supplements that with facial recognition, which isn't as secure",0
230,"For that reason, Samsung won't let banking and other sensitive apps use just the face, but it's OK for unlocking the phone (you can disable it if you're concerned)",0
230,"In any case, glasses can still be challenging, but there's a fingerprint sensor on the back as a backup",0
230,It's moved slightly to reduce smudges on the camera lens,0
230,"Beyond that, the phone's design hasn't changed much from last year's S8",0
230,But that's OK,0
230,No need to fix what isn't broken,0
230,What matters is what the phone does — and shoots,0
231,"TORONTO: Are you branded as anti-social for being glued to your smartphones? Take heart, for, according to a study, smartphone addiction could be a hyper-social behaviour that stems from the healthy human desire to socialise",0
231,"Researchers have found that besides the desire to watch and monitor others, the longing to be seen and monitored by others, runs deep in our evolutionary past",1
231,"Thus, the most addictive smartphone functions shared a common theme of tapping into the human desire to connect with other people",1
231,"Humans evolved to be a uniquely social species and require constant input from others to seek a guide for culturally appropriate behaviour that also paved a path for them to find meaning, goals, and a sense of identity",0

231,"While smartphones harness a normal and healthy need for sociality, the pace and scale of hyper-connectivity pushes the brain's reward system to run on overdrive, which can lead to unhealthy addictions, the researchers warned in a paper published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology",0
231,Turning off push notifications and setting up appropriate times to check your phone can go a long way to regain control over smartphone addiction,1

255,CHENNAI: Hyperloop is the latest buzz in the town,0
255,"Sir Richard Branson, the CEO of the LA-based Virgin Hyperloop One touched down in Mumbai last week",1
255,"There, he signed an MoU with the Maharashtra government to build the world’s first Hyperloop",0
255,Things began speeding up soon afterwards,0
255,Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the project’s foundation stone at the Magnetic Maharashtra Global Business Summit on Monday,0
255,"Once operational, the Hyperloop will link the cities of Mumbai and Pune",0
255,The travel time between them will shrink to a mere 25 minutes from the present three-and-half hours,0
255,"However, it’s not all that easy",0
255,Technical challenges and huge cost involved in building a Hyperloop have given many second thoughts about its viability,1
255,"What is Hyperloop?

Hyperloop is a futuristic mode of transport proposed by LA-based billionaire investor Elon Musk in 2012",0
255,"In Hyperloop, pods or containers will carry people at speeds over 1000 km/hr through a low-pressure tube",1
255,"Musk called it the fifth mode of transport -- the other four being rail, road, air, and water",0
255,"​

How does it work?

The pods or containers will float through the tube using magnetic levitation technology",0
255,"Put simply, magnetic levitation is the use of magnetic force to lift an object and propel it forward",0
255,Magnets have two oppositely polarised ends - North and South,0
255,Two poles that are similar repel each other and vice versa,0
255,This property of magnets is used to push and pull the pods forwards,0
255,The technique has been around for quite some time and is presently used to levitate and float the high-speed Maglev rail networks across Europe,0
255,How does it help? The pods don’t come in touch with any surface,0
255,This ensures that there is no friction,0
255,"When the wheels of a train hurtle through a track, it generates a significant amount of friction, which drags the train, leading to increased energy consumption",0
255,Pods don’t have to deal with friction as they float through a low-pressure tube,0
255,"Also, the tubes are pumped to near vacuum",0
255,"This means that there is very little air pressure, and thus, almost no resistance to the forward movement of pods",0
255,The absence of friction and air pressure enables the pods to travel at much greater speed than a train running through a track,0
255,"How does it help?

The biggest advantage of Hyperloop is that it saves times",0
255,"But what about money? Every day, nearly 1",0
255,5 lakh vehicles travel from Pune to Mumbai,0
255,"Hyperloop will not only reduce traffic congestion on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, but also cut down on carbon emission by 150,000 tonnes annually, claims Virgin Hyperloop One",1
255,Economic benefits are also abounding,0
255,"Richard Branson, the CEO of the Virgin Hyperloop One has claimed that the economic benefits accrued to India due to time and energy saved and increased productivity would amount to Rs 3",0
255,5 lakh crore over 30 years,0
255,There is no way to test his claim as the world is yet to have its first operational Hyperloop system,0
255,"Also, high-speed commute means one could travel from his/her home in Pune to workplace in Mumbai in a matter of less than half an hour",0
255,This may reduce the housing congestion in Mumbai and might help bring down the cost of housing there,0
255,"Moreover, faster connectivity will help cities push their frontiers and accelerate the pace of their economic growth",0
255,"For instance, businesses and manufacturers catering to Pune would benefit if the city becomes a key residential hub for those working in Mumbai",0
255,"Also, it would become a key investment destination",0
255,"Businessmen, eager to cash in on Pune’s expanding middle class, would throng to the city, leading to its expansion",0
255,"Will it benefit an average person?

We don’t know yet",0
255,Richard Branson aims to make Hyperloops affordable for everyone,0
255,"“We are not pricing this for the wealthy, but it will be for the masses,” he said",0
255,Experts are skeptical though,0
255,"To begin with, it is still a concept that has not yet been successfully implemented",0
255,"So, it is not easy to get a realistic estimate",0
255,"Last year, the US Department of Transportation noted in a feasibility study that the “Cost estimates for a land-based Hyperloop system may appear lower than other modes, but as the technology is still conceptual and in very initial testing, there is uncertainty in both the underlying infrastructure needed to operate a system and the cost to construct it",0
255,"”

Estimates vary, but almost everyone agrees that the capital cost for a project of this scale would be very huge",0
255,Just how huge? Leaked documents from Hyperloop One puts the cost at $120 million or Rs 780 crore per mile,0
255,"In other words, building a 100-mile-long (160 km) Hyperloop system would cost approximately seventy-eight thousand crore rupees",0
255,Anybody investing so much money into a project would want to recover it in the long run,0
255,Although Elon Musk claimed that the ticket for a journey between L,0
255,A,0
255,"and San Francisco could be priced as low as $20 (Rs 1300), many believe this would be a bad idea, if the Hyperloop is to be profitable for the investor",0
255,Many academics have also come forward expressing their skepticism about the project’s financial viability,0
255,"Bent Flyvbjerg, an economist specialising in mega-projects at Oxford University agrees that it would be extremely difficult to make such a project financially viable",0
255,"Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard University echoes Flyvbjerg",0
255,"“It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision,” he says",0
255,"Is it technically viable?

Cost aside, technological challenges pose major hurdles",0
255,The idea of a pod floating through a near-vacuum tube is not very far fetched,0
255,But there are numerous other issues that need to be tackled,0
255,“The biggest concern with this plan has to do with temperature,0
255,The pod will be compressing air and expelling it downwards and backward,0
255,"All that air compression creates an enormous amount of heat, which can damage the pod and its machinery,” writes Sam Jaffe, Managing Director of Cairn Energy Research Advisors",0
255,"Further, constructing and maintaining a 150-km long low-pressure tube would be a significant challenge",0
255,According to Dr,0
255,"Phil Mason, a former chemist at Cornell University, maintaining a long vacuum tube would be a nearly impossible task",0
255,He says the air from outside would push against the walls of the near-vacuum tube “with a force of roughly 10 tons per square meter,0
255,"” “That’s a huge amount of force to place on a steel wall of less than one-inch thickness and almost no air inside,” he says",0
255,Experts fear new challenges would present themselves once the engineers set themselves to the task of building the world’s first Hyperloop,0
255,"​

Is it safe for humans?

Well, nobody knows for sure",0
255,"Scientists worry that since pods travel at near subsonic speed, passengers would have to withstand a tremendous amount of G-force",1
255,"At that speed, even a small curve in the tube would produce so much centrifugal force that most riders would end up sick",0
255,One must wait and see if people would walk out of the pods like zombies dead walking in Hollywood films,0

263,SAN FRANCISCO: Knowing the risk of a heart attack or a stroke could soon become as simple as an eye test as researchers at Google and its health-tech arm Verily have found that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) could help identify signals of heart diseases through retinal images,1
263,"""AI offers us the potential for new, less invasive tests for heart health -- predicting cardiovascular results from retinal images with computer vision -- encouraging early results!,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on Tuesday while referring the study in a tweet",1
263,"The study, published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering, showed that deep learning applied to a retinal fundus image, a photograph that includes the blood vessels of the eye, can predict risk factors for heart diseases -- from blood pressure to smoking status",0
263,"The algorithm that the researchers produced can even help predict the occurrence of a future major cardiovascular event on par with current measures, said Michael McConnell, Head of Cardiovascular Health Innovations at Verily in blog post",0
263,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally and researchers know that lifestyle factors including exercise and diet in combination with genetic factors, age, ethnicity, and sex all contribute to it",0
263,"However, they do not exactly know how these factors add up in a particular individual, and so in some patients it becomes essential to perform sophisticated tests, like coronary calcium CT scans, to help better stratify an individual's risk for having a heart attack or a stroke, and such other cardiovascular events",0
263,"In this study, using deep learning algorithms trained on data from 284,335 patients, the researchers were able to predict cardiovascular risk factors from retinal images with surprisingly high accuracy for patients from two independent datasets of 12,026 and 999 patients",0
263,"The algorithm could distinguish the retinal images of a smoker from that of a non-smoker 71 per cent of the time, the study found",1
263,"""In addition, while doctors can typically distinguish between the retinal images of patients with severe high blood pressure and normal patients, our algorithm could go further to predict the systolic blood pressure within 11 mmHg on average for patients overall, including those with and without high blood pressure,"" study co-author Lily Peng, Product Manager, Google Brain Team, said",0
263,"""One of the exciting aspects of this study is the generation of 'attention maps' to show which aspects of the retina contributed most to the algorithm, thus providing a window into the 'black box' often associated with machine learning,"" McConnell, who is also a co-author of the study, said",0
263,"This can give clinicians greater confidence in the algorithm, and potentially provide new insights into retinal features not previously associated with cardiovascular risk factors or future risk, McConnell said",1
263,"The findings suggest that a simple retinal image could one day help understand the health of a patient's blood vessels, key to cardiovascular health",1
263,"""This is promising, but early research -- more work must be done to develop and validate these findings on larger patient cohorts before this can arrive in a clinical setting,"" McConnell added",0

270,"""Peer approval is important during adolescence, especially in early adolescence, so they're sharing content that they think others will find impressive,"" Yau added",1
270,"Facebook and Instagram provide opportunities for young people to connect and communicate with friends as well as people they know in person but are not necessarily close to, such as classmates",0
270,"These social media channels allow individuals time to craft and edit posts and, unlike offline situations, offer teenagers the chance to consider -- even strategise about -- how they want to present themselves online",1

271,WASHINGTON D,1
271,C: A new stretchable electronics has been found for stroke recovery treatment which has proven to be a game changer,1
271,A groundbreaking new wearable designed to be worn on the throat could have been developed in the field of stroke rehabilitation in the Northwestern University,1
271,The new technology’s sensor is the latest in Professor John A,0
271,"Rogers' growing portfolio of stretchable electronics that are precise enough for use in advanced medical care and portable enough to be worn outside the hospital, even during extreme exercise",0
271,"Rogers' sensors stick directly to the skin, moving with the body and providing detailed health metrics including heart function, muscle activity, and quality of sleep",1
271,"""Stretchable electronics allow us to see what is going on inside patients' bodies at a level traditional wearables simply cannot achieve"", Rogers said",0
271,"""The key is to make them as integrated as possible with the human body",0
271,"""

Rogers' new bandage-like throat sensor measured patients' swallowing ability and patterns of speech",0
271,"The sensors aid in the diagnosis and treatment of aphasia, a communication disorder associated with stroke",1
271,The tools that speech-language pathologists have traditionally used to monitor patients' speech function - such as microphones - cannot distinguish between patients' voices and ambient noise,0
271,"""Our sensors solve that problem by measuring vibrations of the vocal chords"", Rogers said",0
271,"""But they only work when worn directly on the throat, which is a very sensitive area of the skin",0
271,"We developed novel materials for this sensor that bend and stretch with the body, minimizing discomfort to patients""",0
271,"Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, a research hospital in Chicago, who collaborated with Rodgers for the research, used the throat sensor in conjunction with electronic biosensors - also developed in Rogers' lab - on the legs, arms and chest to monitor stroke patients' recovery progress",0
271,"The intermodal system of sensors streamed data wirelessly to clinicians' phones and computers, providing a quantitative, full-body picture of patients' advanced physical, and physiological responses in real time",0
271,"""One of the biggest problems we face with stroke patients is that their gains tend to drop off when they leave the hospital"", said Arun Jayaraman, a research scientist at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab",0
271,"""With the home monitoring enabled by these sensors, we can intervene at the right time, which could lead to better, faster recoveries for patients""",0
271,"Because the sensors are wireless, they eliminated barriers posed by traditional health monitoring devices in clinical settings",0
271,Data from the sensors would be presented in a dashboard that is easy for both clinicians and patients to understand,0
271,It would send alerts when patients are underperforming on a certain metric and would allow them to set and track progress toward their goals,0
271,"The findings from the study were reported in a symposium at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Annual Meeting in Austin, Texas, USA",0

288,"According to a research project led by the University at Buffalo, New York, and Institute of Semiconductors (IoP) at the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS), the tab -- a triboelectric nanogenerator -- can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy for electronic devices",0
288,"""The human body is an abundant source of energy",1
288,"We thought: 'Why not harness it to produce our own power?'"" said lead author Qiaoqiang Gan, associate professor at the University at Buffalo",0
288,The tab was detailed in the journal Nano Energy,0
288,Triboelectric charging occurs when certain materials become electrically charged after coming into contact with a different material,0
288,Most everyday static electricity is triboelectric,0
288,"The tab consists of two thin layers of gold, with polydimethylsiloxane (also called PDMS -- a silicon-based polymer used in contact lenses, Silly Putty and other products) sandwiched in between",0
288,"One layer of gold is stretched, causing it to crumple upon release and create what looks like a miniature mountain range",0
288,"When that force is reapplied, for example, from a finger bending, the motion leads to friction between the gold layers and PDMS",1
288,"""This causes electrons to flow back and forth between the gold layers",1
288,"The more friction, the greater the amount of power is produced,"" said Yun Xu, professor at the IoP",0
288,The study described a small tab (1,0
288,"5 centimetres long, by one centimetre wide)",0
288,"It delivered a maximum voltage of 124 volts, a maximum current of 10 microamps and a maximum power density of 0",1
288,22 milliwatts per square centimetre,1
288,"That is not enough to quickly charge a smartphone, but it lit 48 red LED lights simultaneously",0
288,"The team is planning to use larger pieces of gold, which when stretched and folded together are expected to deliver even more electricity",0

296,Highlights The Zone Diet was designed by biochemist Barry Sears,0
296,The diet recommends eating three meals and two snacks,0
296,"The diet restricts calorie intake and limits it to 1,200 to 1,500 per day

weight loss diets is a very confusing one",0
296,"There are countless 'scientifically-devised' meal plans and nutrition plans out there, which promise to get you just a little bit closer to your body goals",0
296,"If you're someone who has been trying to lose weight for a while now, you may know how utterly baffling it can be to figure out which diet plan works and which doesn't",0
296,"But, the most important point to remember is that any diet plan you follow, it must aid weight loss in a healthy manner, without depriving your body of essential nutrients",0
296,There is one particular diet that promises to reduce inflammation in the body by making you eat all the essential nutrients,0
296,"The Zone Diet recommends that you eat five times day, so as to prevent 'overeating,' which often happens when you only eat three meals per day",0
296,"The zone diet is a low carb diet and was designed by a biochemist, Barry Sears",1
296,"He has published dozens of books on the diet, making it gain traction worldwide",0
296,"So, what is the Zone Diet?

What Is The 'Zone Diet'?

The official website of Sears' Zone Diet describes 'zone' as a ""real physiological state in your body that can be measured in clinical tests",0
296,""" It further adds, ""If you are in the Zone, you have optimised your ability to control diet-induced inflammation",0
296,""" The website also defines three 'clinical markers' that indicate whether you're in the zone or not",0
296,"These markers include: Triglyceride to High Density lipoproteins, or HDL, cholesterol ratio, AA to EPA ratio, which defines the presence of the two essential fatty acids in blood, and finally, percentage of glycated haemoglobin, or HbA1c",0
296,"Sears has given a value to all three markers, and he theorises that if these three values are met, then your body is in the 'Zone'",0
296,"He has also listed the alleged benefits of the Zone Diet as loss of excess body fat, better performance, increased thinking capabilities, as well as slowed process of ageing",0
296,"To reap the benefits of this diet, Sears recommends that one balance every meal with one-third protein, two-thirds vegetable and fruit carbs, and a dash of fat",0
296,"What Can You Eat In The 'Zone Diet'?

There aren't many foods that are off-limits in the zone diet, except foods like pastas and breads, as well as fruits that are high in sugar",0
296,People who follow the diet generally eat three meals and two snacks per day,0
296,"The main foods include sources of lean proteins like salmon, carbohydrates from vegetables, and small amounts of good fat from olive oil, walnuts, avocados, etc",0
296,"Zone diet evangelists believe that the diet restricts their calorie intake to 1,200 to 1,500 per day",0
296,"Also Read: The Alkaline Diet: Does it Really Work for Weight Loss?

Does Zone Diet Work?

There's no sound research or scientific evidence, or any peer-reviewed study that proves that the zone diet improves metabolism or quickens fat burn",0
296,"The only thing that works in its favour is that it restricts calorie-intake while promoting satiety, both of which are indicators of a good weight loss diet",0
296,"But, then again, any diet that restricts calorie intake may result in weight loss",0
296,It's always advisable to consult your physician before following any 'fad diet,0

313,"Facebook faces substantial business risks from new European Union privacy rules set to take effect in May, a looming reality that came into stark relief over the weekend with revelations that a controversial political consulting firm had improperly obtained personal data on 50 million Facebook users",0
313,"Privacy experts said the disclosure that a researcher had sold Facebook data collected via a personality quiz to the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica is a prime example of the kinds of practices that the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is supposed to prevent or punish",0
313,The danger faced by Facebook going forward is two-fold: Complying with the rules means letting European users opt out of the highly targeted online ads that have made Facebook a money machine,1
313,Violating GDPR mandates could subject the California company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues,0
313,"Facebook-Cambridge Analytica Scandal Explained in 10 Simple Points

Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on May 25, it ""would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue"", said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems",0
313,"Because a UK company was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, GDPR would have applied",0
313,"Shares in Facebook fell on Monday by 7 percent, their biggest drop since 2014, wiping nearly $40 billion off the value of the firm founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg",0
313,Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users,1
313,Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015,1
313,"Schrems has founded a non-profit, called None Of Your Business (NOYB), that is hiring lawyers and exploring avenues for ""strategic litigation"" over GDPR privacy violations",1
313,"According to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who formerly worked with Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm used the data to help then-US presidential candidate Donald Trump to predict and influence choices at the ballot box",0
313,"""The fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn't adequately monitoring what third-parties were doing,"" said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild",0
313,Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices,0
313,"Facebook said it changed its policies in 2014 to ""to give much less data, especially about friends,"" Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth said in a Facebook post on Monday",0
313,"""We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,"" the company said on Monday",0
313,"""We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process",0

Compliance with GDPR rules could cost Facebook a significant amount of money",0
313,"Deutsche Bank analysts in January estimated that Facebook's overall revenue could be lowered by 4 percent in a scenario in which 30 percent of EU users opt out of targeted ads, reducing the effectiveness and likely price of ads shown by 50 percent",0
313,"The EU represents 24 percent of Facebook's ad revenue, so multiplying those figures, the bank said the regulations could have a 4 percent impact on overall Facebook revenue",0
313,"""If this regulatory approach spreads to other countries or if GDPR ever becomes more onerous over the medium or long term, it would pose more risk,"" Deutsche Bank warned",0

313,Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser reiterated his 'sell' rating on Facebook after the weekend reports,0
313,Wieser expressed concerns that the company's regulatory risks would intensify and that its sophisticated use of data in advertising was in jeopardy,0
313,A December 2017 survey found that only 21 percent of European consumers know what GDPR is,0

313,"Giving consumers control

The quandary for Facebook is readily apparent from a video it began showing customers in February: it teaches people how to delete their accounts",0
313,"GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies",0
313,"Social networks will also need to regain Europeans' consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising",0
313,"Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn",0
313,"""There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,"" she told Reuters",0
313,"Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next",0
313,"For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face",0
313,The company did not make those features available in Europe,0
313,Facebook did not specify a reason,0
313,But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor,0
313,Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions,0
313,"The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented ""in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language",0
313,"""

In other words, the days of extensive ""terms of service"" agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, numerous data privacy lawyers told Reuters",0
313,"In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more ""permissions screens"" and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature",0
313,"That could depress usage, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said at an investor conference last month",0
313,"""Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there's some potential that people decide they're not going to use the product,"" Wehner said",0

318,"By contrast, a lawsuit involving an autonomous vehicle could revolve around whether the self-driving system had a design defect, legal experts said",1
318,Design defect claims do not require a finding of fault or negligence,0
318,"To prevail, a plaintiff must show only that a product had an inherent design defect that would render it unsafe",0
318,"Automakers and software writers could counter with detailed data gathered by on-board sensors on how cars behaved during a collision, experts said, to show that it was impossible for the vehicle to avoid a collision and that all the systems functioned properly",0
318,"One question that would likely arise in litigation is whether Uber, Volvo or any companies that supplied self-driving technology entered into indemnification agreements, in which an entity assumes another company's liability costs",0
318,"Paul Rafferty, a California-based lawyer who represents carmakers, said such agreements in the autonomous vehicle world are confidential and disputes over indemnification are generally arbitrated or mediated behind closed doors",0
318,Volvo declined to comment on whether it had entered into indemnification agreements with Uber,0
318,"Jennifer Dukarski, a Detroit-based lawyer representing suppliers of autonomous-vehicle technology, said the lawsuit filed by the San Francisco motorcyclist against GM raised only negligence claims",0
318,"So if any litigation in the Arizona accident alleges design defect claims, it could set legal precedent and be ""very impactful"" on the nascent autonomous vehicle industry, she said",1
318,"Regardless of who is at fault, the University of South Carolina's Smith said he would expect Uber, which has faced past scrutiny over its business practices, to settle any litigation quickly to avoid the public spotlight",0

320,Arizona officials said on Tuesday they saw no immediate need to tighten rules on the testing of self-driving cars in the state in reaction to a fatal accident involving an Uber autonomous vehicle that has focused attention on the safety of the new technology,0
320,"Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp said it will pause autonomous vehicle testing following Sunday's accident in which an Uber Technologies self-driving SUV struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona",1
320,Automakers and tech companies are evaluating whether or not to suspend their autonomous vehicle programs in the wake of the first fatality involving a self-driving vehicle,1
320,Uber said on Monday it was suspending its own program,0
320,"Toyota said it was temporarily pausing its testing on US public roads to help its test drivers, who could be experiencing ""an emotional effect"" from the incident",0
320,"""This 'timeout' is meant to give them time to come to a sense of balance about the inherent risks of their jobs,"" the automaker said in a statement",0
320,"Uber, along with other technology companies and automakers, has been testing in Arizona, which regulates autonomous vehicles with a lighter touch than neighbouring states such as California",0
320,"The state has a long history of allowing automakers to test new vehicles on its wide, open roads, and a 2015 executive order by Governor Doug Ducey paved the way for companies to test autonomous technology without interference by the legislature",0
320,"More than 600 self-driving vehicles are now testing on Arizona roads, according to the governor's office",1
320,"On Tuesday, Arizona's director for policy and communications at the state's department of transportation, Kevin Biesty, said existing regulations were sufficient and that the state had no immediate plans to issue new rules",0
320,"""We believe we have enough in our laws right now to regulate automobiles,"" Biesty told Reuters",0
320,"""There will be issues that the legislature will have to address in the future as these become more widespread",0

During the early phase of self-driving vehicle testing, Arizona refrained from adding new restrictions on companies testing on state roads, Biesty said, adding they did not believe any new regulations would add to safety",0
320,Biesty said his agency was waiting for federal safety regulators to conclude an investigation before drawing any conclusions,0
320,"Arizona's self-driving vehicle oversight committee has not planned any meetings or actions, he said",0
320,"Also on Tuesday, Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell issued a statement saying he supported Uber's decision to suspend testing until the end of the investigation",0
320,His office said the mayor had not asked other autonomous vehicle companies to suspend testing in the city,0
320,"Full details are still forthcoming surrounding the death on Sunday night of pedestrian Elaine Herzberg after she was struck by Uber's test vehicle, a Volvo SC 90 sport utility vehicle, operating in autonomous mode",0

320,"Investigators will be in Tempe for the rest of the week and will not release findings until reviews of information from the scene and analysis of vehicle data are finished, the agency said",0
320,Uber's Advanced Technologies Group office in Tempe appeared empty on Tuesday except for a security guard who said only a small security crew was working at the site since the accident,0
320,The autonomous vehicles normally filling the parking lot outside were nowhere to be seen,0
320,"The fatality is drawing fresh attention to the safety of autonomous vehicles, and the challenges of testing them on public streets",0
320,"Self-driving cars have been involved in minor accidents, but nearly all have been blamed on human motorists hitting the autonomous vehicle",0
320,The outcome of the investigations in Arizona will be pivotal for companies racing to profit from robo-taxi services and automated delivery vehicles,0

321,Facebook Messenger has received a bunch of new features to enhance your group chat experience,1
321,There are admin privileges as well as joinable links and real-time voice and video chats support within groups to make users stick to group conversations on Messenger,0
321,These new updates are also aimed to uplift the last year's record of supporting the creation of over 2,0
321,5 million new groups on a daily basis,0

321,"This means any new members will not be a part of the group you've created, without your permission or another admin",0
321,You need to approve new members from your side to let them start catching up with other members of your group,0
321,"Further, admins have also been provided with the ability to remove any existing members if needed, and promote or demote a member in the group chat as an admin",0
321,The option to require admin approval for new members is by default disabled on Facebook Messenger,0
321,"However, you can enable it by going to your group chat setting",0
321,"Alongside admin privileges, Facebook Messenger has added joinable links to let you easily invite new people to your group chats",1
321,Anyone in a group chat can create a custom invite link and share it using either the Messenger app or any third-party messaging app,1
321,"People who tap the link will either be added to the group instantly, if approvals are off, or will be added after admin approval",0
321,"To take on group chats on Skype, Facebook Messenger has included real-time voice and video chats in groups with a limit of up to 50 people at a time",0
321,This is more than the limit of 25 people for a group video chat or conference call on Skype,1
321,"Moreover, you can add contacts to your in-progress voice and video chats without any interruption in the conversation, as per the company",0

322,Digital payment systems have ballooned in popularity in India since the government scrapped large-value bank notes in 2016,0
322,"Among these offerings are applications that enable smartphone users to buy, sell or store gold - even in small amounts - kept in secured vaults operated by MMTC-PAMP India Pvt Ltd, a joint venture between MMTC Ltd, the largest national trading firm, and Swiss gold refiner PAMP",0
322,"Although online gold purchases have been growing globally for years, they are a relatively recent phenomenon in India, where jewellery and bars of the precious metal tend to be kept in hand and given as gifts",0

322,It is difficult to gauge how many new buyers are entering the market because of online access,0
322,"The e-wallet operator Paytm said that in the first six months after it began offering digital gold last April, it facilitated about $18",1
322,4 million (roughly Rs,1
322,120 crores) worth of sales - a tiny fraction of the Indian gold market,0
322,"With the vast majority of purchases made in the traditional way, demand for physical gold isn't abating, ""especially when physical gold plays an important role at Indian weddings,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK Ltd",0

322,"Gold trading traditionally peaks around festival and wedding seasons, experts say",0
322,But Singh added that because digital gold lowers the minimum price needed to buy gold - from about Rs,1
322,"3,000 previously, enough to buy roughly 1 gram of gold at current prices - and boosts market transparency via live pricing, there has been a rise in the frequency of gold purchases at other times of the year",0

326,"Self-driving cars have claimed their first pedestrian fatality, a woman in Tempe, Arizona, who was struck and killed by an Uber vehicle travelling in autonomous mode",0
326,"Weren't self-driving cars supposed to be safer than those piloted by fallible humans?

And who says they aren't? As many on social media rushed to point out, more than 37,000 people were killed by human-piloted vehicles in 2016",0
326,"Compared with that, one pedestrian fatality, however sad, looks pretty good",0
326,This argument is appealing,0
326,"Unfortunately, it's wrong",0
326,"Motor vehicle fatalities are measured in terms of ""vehicle miles travelled,"" which is just what it sounds like",0
326,"In 2016, there were 1",0
326,18 fatalities for every 100 million miles that Americans drove,0
326,Since Americans drove nearly 3,0
326,"2 trillion miles that year, that still added up to tens of thousands of deaths",0
326,"To know whether self-driving cars are safer than the traditional kind, you'd have to know how many miles they travelled before incurring this first fatality",0
326,"And the answer is "" fewer than 100 million"" - a lot fewer",0
326,"Waymo, the industry leader, recently reported logging its 4 millionth mile of road travel, with much of that in Western states that offer unusually favourable driving conditions",0
326,Uber just reached 2 million miles with its autonomous program,0
326,"Other companies are working on fully autonomous systems, but adding them all together couldn't get us anywhere close to 100 million",0
326,"(The numbers go up if you add Tesla's autopilot, but that system has more limited capabilities, and fatality statistics don't necessarily get any clearer - or more favourable - if you do",0
326,")

One fatality at these numbers of road-miles driven does not suggest, to put it mildly, a safety improvement over humans",0
326,"It's more like dramatic step backward, or if you like, a high-speed reverse",0
326,Which is not to say that we should pull the plug on autonomous driving,0
326,"For one thing, regular old-fashioned cars were none too safe when they first arrived on American roads",0
326,"In 1921, the first year for which such data is available, there were 24 deaths for every 100 million vehicle miles travelled",0
326,"Over time, improved cars, drivers and roads reduced that figure by nearly 95 percent",0
326,"Presumably, self-driving cars can also improve",0
326,"Given their other benefits, it's worth working for those improvements, regardless of whether these cars are currently less safe than human drivers",0
326,"Think of all the elderly forced to leave their homes when they can no longer drive, the people whose disabilities make it hard or impossible for them to operate a car, the barroom drunks who get behind the wheel because there's no easy way to get home",0
326,"Autonomous vehicles promise to solve these major problems; we should pursue that promise, even at the temporary cost of some road safety now",0
326,Especially since it's not clear that there is actually a cost in road safety,0
326,The glib insistence that self-driving cars are safer than human drivers is not well-founded - but neither is a counterreaction that insists that they're obviously much more dangerous,1
326,"Even if you could design a system that you knew would have one fatal accident every hundred million miles on average (roughly the same as a human driver), that wouldn't mean that the car would strike and kill someone just as the odometer hit 100 million",0
326,"The accident might occur on mile 5 million, or mile 99 million - or heck, you might get lucky and not have a fatality until mile 115 million",0
326,It's not possible to confidently assess the risk of an accident based on a single event like this,0
326,Statistical regularities that are apparent in large data pools get lost in the noise when the sample is too small,0
326,We won't know how dangerous self-driving cars are compared with human drivers until they've driven billions more miles,1
326,"At the moment, we just know that they can kill people, not how often they will",0
326,And that's a possibility that advocates for self-driving cars should have prepared the public for better than they have,0
326,"Enthusiasts for autonomous vehicles have been a little too quick to respond to safety concerns by pointing out how many accidents human drivers have - or by noting that self-driving cars don't text, or drive drunk, or fall asleep at the wheel",0
326,"All true, but as they drive more and more miles, we may discover that they have problems humans don't",0
326,Uber has already pulled its autonomous cars off the road in response to this tragedy,0
326,"If it hadn't, it seems likely that the public pressure to do so would have been deafening",0
326,The company - and advocates of autonomous vehicles more generally - will need to put in a lot of work over the next few months restoring public faith in this technology,0

327,"China is on its way to becoming the world leader in international patent filings, and should overtake the top spot from the United States within three years, the UN said Wednesday",1
327,"A record 243,500 international patent applications were filed last year, a hike of 4",0
327,"5 percent from a year earlier, the World Intellectual Property Organisation said in its annual report",0
327,"These patents ""represent the best new technology that is arising in the world,"" WIPO chief Francis Gurry told journalists in Geneva",0
327,"The US kept the top ranking, which it has held for the past four decades, with American-based companies and individuals filing 56,624 applications, or nearly a quarter of the global total",0
327,"But it was the rapid growth in international patent filings from China, which passed Japan to reach second place, that drove the global increase, WIPO said",1
327,"Chinese companies and individuals filed a total of 48,882 international patents last year, marking a hike of 13",0
327,"4 percent from a year earlier, the UN agency said",0
327,"China, the only country to record double-digit growth in its patent applications in 2017, has posted growth higher than 10 percent every year since 2003",1
327,"""At current trends, (China) is projected to overtake the US within three years as the largest source of applications filed under WIPO's Patent Cooperation Treaty,"" the agency said",1
327,"""One cannot but notice that there has been a remarkable transformation in the Chinese economy, and that China has gone from a position of being largely a user of technologies to a producer of technologies,"" Gurry said",0
327,He refused to comment on whether US President Donald Trump's expressed anxiety over competition from China was warranted,0
327,"But he told reporters that ""China has clearly arrived as a major competitor in the field of technology",0

327,"They were followed by Intel Corporation of the United States, with 2,637 patents and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation of Japan, with 2,521",0
327,"The ""rapid rise in Chinese use of the international patent system shows that innovators there are increasingly looking outward, seeking to spread their original ideas into new markets as the Chinese economy continues its rapid transformation,"" Gurry said in a statement",0

328,8-inch model of the iPhone will have a total bill of materials (MBOM) over 10 percent lower than the iPhone X had when it was initially launched,0
328,Lin says in the report that the iPhone X MBOM was more than $400 in 2017,1
328,"Due to this cost reduction, the report says, ""Apple may position the new 5",0
328,85-inch device as the cheapest model of all three next-generation iPhone models,0

Interestingly, Lin says Apple had previously planned to bring another LCD version of the 5",0

328,"However, the project was suspended ""mid-February and may be eventually terminated",0
328,""" The company was reportedly planning to launch the LCD version of the handset ""due to MBOM concerns",0
328,"""

The report also added that, due to a weak demand of the iPhone X, Apple took fewer OLED panels from Samsung Display, which resulted in ""more bargaining chips"" for the latter in negotiations for the manufacturing of 2018 iPhone",0
328,"While this could have led to price increments, the report claims that Apple has already reached an agreement with Samsung Display ""with satisfactory terms",0
328,"""

Lin believes that the 5",0

386,"Today, only the jawless lampreys have four eyes, according to researchers at Senckenberg Research Institute in Germany The third and fourth eyes refer to pineal and parapineal organs, eye-like photosensory structures on the top of the head that play key roles in orientation and in circadian and annual cycles",1
386,"The new findings help to elucidate the evolutionary history of these structures among vertebrates, researchers said",1
386,"The photosensitive pineal organ is found in a number of lower vertebrates such as fishes and frogs, they said",1
386,"It is often referred to as the ""third eye"" and was widespread in primitive vertebrates",1
386,"""On the one hand, there was this idea that the third eye was simply reduced independently in many different vertebrate groups such as mammals and birds and is retained only in lizards among fully land-dwelling vertebrates,"" said Krister Smith from the Senckenberg Research Institute",1
386,"""On the other hand, there was this idea that the lizard third eye developed from a different organ, called the parapineal, which is well developed in lampreys",1
386,"These two ideas did not really cohere,"" Smith said",0
386,By discovering a four-eyed lizard - in which both pineal and parapineal organs formed an eye on the top of the head - the researchers confirmed that the lizard third eye really is different from the third eye of other jawed vertebrates,0
386,Smith and his colleagues got the idea that the fossilised lizards might have a fourth eye after other experts came to contradictory conclusions about where the lizard's third eye was located,0
386,"Smith and colleagues turned to museum specimens collected nearly 150 years ago as part of the Yale College Expedition to the Bridger Basin, Wyoming in the US",0
386,"CT scans showed that two different individuals had spaces where a fourth eye would have been, which, Smith said, ""I certainly did not expect!"" Their evidence confirms that the pineal and parapineal glands were not a pair of organs in the way that vertebrate eyes are",0
386,They also suggest that the third eye of lizards evolved independently of the third eye in other vertebrate groups,1
386,"Smith said that while there is ""nothing mystical"" about the pineal and parapineal organs, they do enable extraordinary abilities",1
386,"For instance, they allow some lower vertebrates to sense the polarisation of light and use that information to orient themselves geographically",1
387,"NEW DELHI: Noting the increase in air pollution due to industrial units in many cities across the country, the Union environment ministry has expanded the ambit of emission standard norms of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) for five industries - ceramic, foundry industries (furnaces based on fuel), glass, lime kiln and reheating furnace - and asked states to ensure their implementation",1
387,The emission standards for these industries were notified on March 22,1
387,"It said the ministry took into account the “seriousness of air pollution that has direct impact on the human population” and therefore decided to waive of public\stakeholders’ consultation before notifying these standards under the Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2018",1
387,"Normally, the ministry first puts out draft notification in public domain for comments",1
387,It then notifies it finally considering suggestions of stakeholders on the draft after 30 or 60 days,1
387,"Though the move to waive of consultation period will ensure that these standards come into force with immediate effect, its enforcement may be a big challenge keeping in view the inadequate capacity of state pollution control boards (SPCBs)",1
387,The ministry had earlier set environmental standards for the cement industry in 2016,1
387,It had also in December 2015 notified revised standards for coal-based thermal power plants (TPPs),1
387,"The new standards, based on the recommendation of the central pollution control board (CPCB), were aimed at reducing emission of particulate matter (PM10), sulphur dioxide and oxide of nitrogen which would, in turn, help in bringing about an improvement in the ambient air quality (AAQ)",0
387,"Enforcement of these standards for coal-based power plants have, however, been quite patchy with majority of the plants failing to meet the ministry’s earlier deadline of December 7, 2017",0
387,"Citing practical difficulties, the central electricity authority ( CEA ) had later sought extension of deadline for installation of necessary equipment to control emissions up to December, 2022 - five years more than what the TPPs had agreed in 2015",0
387,Even the environment ministry had in December last year supported the CEA’s move in the Supreme Court,0

388,The concept is simple,1
388,"Rather than jogging on by the garbage littered on the street, ploggers pick it up and dispose of it correctly instead",1
388,"To plog even more effectively, some ploggers fit in some additional exercises as they bend to pick up litter — to keep their heart rate pumping",1
388,And it turns out the exercise really pays off — for the environment and your body,0
388,"According to fitness app Lifesum, which allows users to input and track calories burned while plogging , the eco-friendly work-out is significantly more effective than just jogging",0
388,"As plogging requires some bending and arm strength to hold all the garbage, a half hour of plogging will burn 288 calories on average - compared to just 235 calories from regular jogging",0
388,"On social media, the plogging craze is also gaining popularity as people share photos of the trash they’ve collected or realise that they’ve actually been plogging all along",0
388,"On Instagram, the exercise has been tagged in over 3,000 posts and various Facebook groups dedicated to the workout have popped up",1

389,"The 48-second clip shows the elephant picking up something from the forest floor, ingesting it and puffing out smoke",0
389,"The animal, it turned out, was blowing off ash before apparently eating wood charcoal in the recently burnt patch of forest, giving the impression that it was smoking",0
389,"“It’s the first-ever visual documentation of such behaviour by an elephant,” said Vinay Kumar, assistant director at WCS , who shot the video",0
389,Kumar told TOI that the video was shot in the morning nearly two years ago,1
389,“We found the female elephant at the edge of the forest,1

389,"Why an elephant would consume charcoal, which has no food value, has led to speculation among wildlife scientists",1
389,"According to Varun R Goswami, an elephant biologist at WCS India, charcoal has well recognised toxin-binding properties, and although it may not have much nutritional content, animals may be attracted to it for this medicinal value",0
389,"It can also serve as a laxative, thereby doubling its utility for animals that consume it after forest fires, lightning strikes, or controlled burns, Goswami said",0
389,“Charcoal ash has traditionally been used for dental hygiene in India,0

390,"Community rights have been recognised in less than 3% of forests so far, says Community Forest Rights—Learning and Advocacy Group, a coalition of organisations",0
390,But some of the success stories have been documented by Centre for Science and Environment in its ‘People’s Forests’ report released last week,0
390,"Shruti Agarwal of CSE says: “These are stories of community empowerment, which suggest that a new future of democratic forest governance is emerging",0
390,"They create confidence in the ability of communities to manage and conserve their forests, and to generate sustainable livelihoods from them",0
390,"”In 2012, the tribal villages of Nayakheda, Payvihir, Upatkheda and Khatijapur were given charge of a highly degraded forest area of 990ha",0
390,Even the assistant conservator of forests of Amravati admits they “received the worst forests”,0
390,"In the first year, villagers focused on planting bamboo and moisture conservation",0
390,"They weeded out invasive species like lantana and non-useful trees like gum tree, planted by the forest department",0
390,"In Payvihir village, they put a stop to the department’s auction of custard apple trees for a meagre Rs 1,500, and began marketing the fruit themselves, earning Rs 16,000 in the first year",0
390,"“These villages have identified forest patches to be kept untouched from any intervention to observe the biodiversity and evolution of natural flora and fauna… Nayakheda has built watering holes for wildlife,” observes the CSE report",0

390,Villagers in Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary got CFR rights over 67% of the area in 2013-14,0
390,"In the first year, 16 villages inside the sanctuary harvested a bumper crop of 96,319 MT of bamboo because of a good flowering season and earned Rs 185 million in revenue",0
390,A dozen villages decided to plough back 30% of the profits into forest protection and the rest into community development,0
390,"The villagers have started working on ways to avoid forest fires, plant indigenous species, and manage water conservation",0
390,The lives of women in Madhikol changed after the village got CFR rights in 2016,0
390,"The gram sabha, consisting of six men and six women, framed rules for patrolling of forests, protection from fires and sustainable harvest of forest produce",1
390,The practice of burning tendu bushes before the plucking season was stopped as the fire destroyed new plants of other important species,0
390,"Earlier, tribal women would stitch siali leaves into plates and sell them to middlemen at a throwaway price of Rs 10 for 80 plates",0
390,"In 2016, they formed a collective and began exporting the plates, earning Rs 50,000",0
390,Panchgaon was the first village in the district to get CFR rights,0
390,The village mandated each household to come up with at least five ideas for management of the forests,0
390,"Eventually, 115 regulations were finalised",0
390,"“Thus, the entire village was party to the decisions taken and the gram sabha’s success in governing its CFRs can be partly attributed to this inclusive and democratic approach,” says the report",0
390,Voluntary patrolling of forests is mandatory here,0
390,"The most important decision of the gram sabha was a ban on removal of tendu leaves, forgoing huge revenue",0
390,"“The collection of tendu leaves requires extensive lopping and setting fires in the forest, affecting the growth of trees and, in turn, the production of edible tendu fruit",1
390,Tendu leaves are used to make bidis which are not good for health,0
390,"On the other hand, birds eat the tendu fruit; and so do we,’ Ramesh Tamke, gram sabha member told CSE researchers",0
390,The state government refuses to recognise the Adivasis’ CFR rights,0
390,But forest communities in north Bengal have been assertive,0
390,Twelve villages in the Chilapata forests of Coochbehar constituted gram sabhas who filed CFR claims in 2008-09 and passed resolutions to conserve forests and wildlife,0
390,"In 2014, they resisted the forest department’s felling operations in elephant corridors as this could have aggravated man-animal conflict",0
390,“The village compelled the forest department to seek the permission of its gram sabha and carried out a survey of the trees marked by the department for felling,0
390,"As more than 1,400 trees of native species would be cut down, the gram sabha refused permission,” states the report",1
390,It quotes Mahesh Rava from Kodalbasti village: “Our forests are better now,0
390,You should have seen them before 2008,0

396,"And in Mexico, people will increasingly gravitate towards urban areas from regions vulnerable to climate change",0

398,"LOS ANGELES: In a breakthrough, scientists have created novel protein mats that can soak up and trap chemical pollution Despite years of effort to stabilise proteins outside of their native environments, scientists have made limited progress in combining proteins with synthetic components without compromising protein activity",0
398,"The study, published in the journal Science, shows a path toward exploiting the power of proteins outside of the cell by demonstrating a unique way to keep proteins active in synthetic environments",0
398,The materials presented in the study could enable on-demand biochemical reactions where they were once not feasible,0
398,"""We think we've cracked the code for interfacing natural and synthetic systems,"" said Ting Xu, professor at University of California , Berkeley in the US",1
398,Proteins are usually unstable outside their native environments,1
398,"To function properly, proteins must fold into a specific structure, often with the help of other proteins",0
398,"To overcome this challenge, researchers analysed trends in protein sequences and surfaces to see if they could develop a synthetic polymer that provides all the things that a protein would need to keep its structure and function",0
398,"""Proteins have very well-defined statistical pattern, so if you can mimic that pattern, then you can marry the synthetic and natural systems, which allows us to make these materials,"" Xu said",1
398,"Researchers created random heteropolymers, called RHPs",1
398,"RHPs are composed of four types of monomer subunits, each with chemical properties designed to interact with chemical patches on the surface of proteins of interest",1
398,The monomers are connected to mimic a natural protein to maximise the flexibility of their interactions with protein surfaces,1
398,"The RHPs act as unstructured proteins, commonly seen inside cells",1
398,They increased membrane protein folding in water during protein translation and preserved water-soluble protein activity in organic solvents,0
398,"The researchers at Northwestern University in the US ran extensive molecular simulations to show that the RHP would interact favourably with protein surfaces, wrap around protein surfaces in organic solvents and weakly in water, leading to correct protein folding and stability in a non-native environment",0
398,"They then tested whether they can use an RHP to create protein-based materials for bioremediation of toxic chemicals, which they were funded to do by the Department of Defense",0
398,"They mixed RHP with a protein called organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH), which degrades the toxic organophosphates found in insecticides and chemical warfare agents",0
398,"The researchers used the RHP/OPH combination to make fibre mats, submersed the mats in a well-known insecticide and found that the mats degraded an amount of insecticide weighing approximately one-tenth of the total fibre mat in just a few minutes",0
398,This opens the door to the creation of larger mats that could soak up toxic chemicals in places like war zones,0

419,Divyanshu’s name appeared in the first list of the directorate of education (DoE) last year for admission under the right to education’s EWS quota norms,0
419,"But when Divyanshu’ father, Naresh Singh Kamti, went to PP International School in Pitampura to get the documents verified, he was turned away as in the birth certificate, the boy’s name was recorded as Sudhanshu",0
419,"DCPCR officials said the parents had changed his name and later produced a fresh birth certificate with the changed name, an advertisement in the newspaper — as per the procedure — and an affidavit on the change dated July 25, 2017 (a copy of it is with TOI)",0
419,They said the parents had also corrected the discrepancy in the online entry to reflect the new name,1
419,The commission has said the school is “determined to not allow the child from attending it”,0
419,"The school, however, claimed that for any such change, “a proper legal process has to be followed to validate it",0
419,DCPCR is not taking cognisance of any such thing”,0
419,"Possession of two birth certificates, it said, was “bad in law”",0

420,"While overall green cover, including tree patches outside recorded forest areas, reported an incremental 1% increase (8,021 sq km) over the last assessment year in 2015, the quality of forests remain a hotly debated subject even as satellite monitoring has increased availability of data",0
420,"The increase, based on satellite data and subsequent ‘ground truthing’, has put the total forest cover at 7,08,273 sq km which is 21",0

420,"39% of India’s geographical area, this does not reflect a complete picture as it includes tree cover of 93,815 sq km, primarily computed by notional numbers",0

420,"Taking into account the density (canopy covering branches and foliage formed by the crowns of trees), forest cover is divided into ‘very dense’, ‘moderately dense’ and ‘open’ forest",0
420,"The ‘very dense’ forest cover has increased over the last assessment of 2015, but the ‘moderately dense’ category reported a decline — a sign which environmentalists consider quite worrying",0
420,"Referring to decline in the ‘moderately dense’ forest category and enhancement of forest cover in ‘open’ forest and ‘scrub’ categories, forest expert from Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) Ajay Saxena said, “This negative correlation means that India is losing good forests for developmental pressures, forest degradation and climate change",0
420,"”Saxena termed the increase in ‘very dense’ forest (VDF) cover as a “positive development”, but said a major part could be attributed to increase in the number of districts assessed in the new report compared to 2015",0
420,The ISFR updated the number of districts for its assessment from 589 to 633,0
420,"The ministry, however, claimed that the change in area was calculated “using updated figures” to facilitate comparison on a common methodological platform",0
420,"Underlining that very dense forest had increased from 85,904 sq km in 2015 to 98,158 sq km, environment and forests minister Harsh Vardhan said, “This is very heartening as VDF absorbs maximum carbon dioxide from the atmosphere",0
420,”He said consistent increase in forest cover over the years was in sync with India’s commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change and the country would meet its target of creating additional carbon sink (2,0
420,5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent) through increase in forest and tree cover by 2030,0
420,"The report showed that forest cover in six north-eastern states — Mizoram, Nagaland , Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Meghalaya and Sikkim — decreased in 2017",0
420,Experts believe forests in the eastern Himalayas are rich in forest carbon and decline in forest cover in the region could have been avoided,1
420,This area reported a net loss of 630 sq km of pristine forests,1
420,"The ISFR 2017 shows that about 40% of the country’s forest cover is present in nine large contiguous patches of the size of 10,000 sq km or more",1
420,"It also shows the total mangrove cover stands at 4,921 sq km and has shown an increase of 181 sq km",1
420,"All the 12 mangrove states have shown a positive change in the mangrove cover, as compared to the last assessment",0
420,Mangrove ecosystem is rich in biodiversity and provides a number of ecological services,1
420,The India State of Forest Report 2017 is the 15th such report in the series,1
420,"The report, however, for the first time contains information on decadal change in water bodies in forest during 2005-2015, forest fire, production of timber from outside forest, state wise carbon stock in different forest types and density classes",0
420,"The report notes that there was an increase of 2,647 sq km in the extent of water bodies over the decade (2005-15) with all states and Union Territories (UTs) showing an increase except Arunachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana",0
420,"It shows that overall the extent of water bodies has increased from 14,509 sq km in 2005 to 17,156 sq km in 2015 with Maharashtra (432 sq km), Gujarat (428 sq km) and Madhya Pradesh (389 sq km) figuring as the top three states reporting maximum increase in areas of water bodies including lakes and wetlands",0
420,"“We wish that in future, extent and change in forest cover vis-e-vis major river basins in the country should be assessed and reported since forest cover is a key parameter to assess the health of our rivers”, said river and water expert, Manoj Misra, of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan",0
420,"Reacting on report which shows marginal increase in forest cover, Misra said, ""Increase in forest cover is a matter to rejoice unless statistical jugglery is behind the claim",0
420,"""The spatial information given in the report is based on interpretation of LISS-III data from Indian Remote Sensing satellite data (Resourcesat-II) with a spatial resolution of 23",0
420,5 meters,0
420,"Satellite data for the entire country was procured from NRSC for the period October, 2015 – February, 2016",0
420,“The satellite data interpretation is followed by rigorous ground truthing,0
420,"In addition, extensive ground data collected by field parties at more than 18000 points all over the country and information from other collateral sources are also used to improve the accuracy of the interpreted image”, said the environment ministry after releasing the ISFR 2017",0
420,"Report shows that three states - Andhra Pradesh (2141 sq km), followed by Karnataka (1101 sq km) and Kerala (1043 sq km) - have shown the maximum increase in forest cover",0
420,"On the other hand, forest cover in states like Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Meghalaya has decreased in 2017 as compared to 2015",0
420,"Madhya Pradesh has the largest forest cover of 77,414 sq km in the country in terms of area, followed by Arunachal Pradesh with 66,964 sq km and Chhattisgarh (55,547 sq km)",0
420,"In terms of percentage of forest cover with respect to the total geographical area, Lakshadweep with (90",1

421,NEW DELHI: Eminent Kannada writer and Jnanpith award winner Chandrashekhara Kambar was elected president of Sahitya Akademi on Friday,1
421,"Kambar, the third Kannadiga to head the Indian Academy of Letters since its inception, defeated his closest opponent and Odia writer Pratibha Ray in a secret ballot",0
421,"Of the 89 members of the general council who voted in Monday’s elections, 56 voted in favour of Kambar, while 29 members voted for Ray as president",0
421,"The third contender for the top job, Marathi writer Bhalchandra Nemade, could only get four votes",1
421,"Conventionally, the vice president of the Sahitya Akademi is elevated to the post of president",1
421,"However, this is not the first time an election to the post was necessitated",1
421,"What writers find discomforting this time, though, is a repeat of the 2003 polls where partisan politics — a ‘Left verus Non-Left’ theme — has resurfaced and taken centrestage at the Akademi",0
421,"Back in 2003, the presidential contest was between the Bharatiya Jnanpith award-winning writer, Mahasweta Devi , and outgoing vice-president of the Akademi, Gopi Chand Narang",0
421,"Mahasweta Devi, despite her stature as a doyen of literature and of the work she had done among tribals, was defeated during the elctions",1
421,"Urdu critic Narang, on the other hand, had won 56 of the 94 votes that were polled",0
421,"While the non-Left had triumphed then, murmurs within the academy of letters on Monday suggested Kambar’s victory was a reassertion of Sahitya Akademi’s relative autonomy in comparison to the other cultural bodies that have allegedly been infiltrated by right-leaning administrators",0
421,"Shortly after being declared President of the Sahitya Akademi, Kambar, also the first vice-chancellor of Kannada University in Hampi, said he was looking forward to providing a platform to regional languages in India and to counter the eurocentric thurst on Literature",0
421,Kambar also thanked outgoing president Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari and said he will remain committed to taking Sahitya Akademi to greater heights,1
421,"Over the last few years, Sahitya Akademi has been at the centre of considerable controversy, including the ‘award wapasi’ campaign where writers returned their Sahitya Akademi awards as a mark of protest against the rising culture of intolerance in the country",1

422,Students of Utkal University strongly protested the order of the government,1
422,The committee headed by Utkal vice chancellor Soumendra Mohan Patnaik told the government that his university has not enough land for the second campus,0
422,Later the state government on February 6 formed an extended committee to decide a location for the second campus,0
422,"Saubhagya Soumyashree Samal, president of university Students' Union, said the institution spread over 24",0
422,57 acres of land near Rupali Square became a university in 2015,0
422,But the land area remained same,0
422,"""The university needs land for opening of new departments, good laboratories, sports complex, research centres to start doctoral programmes",0
422,"The second campus is need of the hour,"" she added",1
422,She said the institution became the first women's university of the state with 47 affiliated women's colleges under it,1
422,"""How can the university manage with a small piece of land at the existing campus? We hope the higher education minister will announce something related to this issue on Tuesday,"" she added",0
422,"Debasmita Dash, general secretary of the union, said they hope the ministers will clear air on the second campus controversy",1
422,""" Khallikote University and GM University got their second campus, but our university is yet to get a land for setup of the campus,"" she added",0
422,The student leaders will request the ministers on the occasion of the annual day celebration to demarcate a suitable land for the second campus,0
422,They will also urge them not to merge the autonomous college with the university and create principal post for the college,0
423,"MUMBAI: Two days before the deadline to apply for Mumbai University’s vice-chancellor’s post, the appointment of the search committee that will choose a candidate is under a cloud",1
423,"The SC, while hearing an application challenging the constitution of the committee, on Monday, said the VC’s appointment will be subject to the outcome of the case",1
423,Candidates had to apply to the committee by February 14,0
423,"The petitioner, A D Sawant, a former MU pro-vice-chancellor, said the committee’s constitution is in contrary to the UGC regulations",0
423,He said the committee is liable to be quashed or a stay be granted on the process initiated by it,0
423,The SC has not stayed the process,0
423,"Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao, chancellor of state universities, appointed eminent scientist and former ISRO chief K Kasturirangan as chairman of the committee in October last year after former VC Sanjay Deshmukh was asked to step down from the VC’s post",0
423,"The state appointed Cidco vice-chairman Bhushan Gagrani as their nominee, while Shyam Lal Soni, director of NIT Uttarakhand, was Mumbai University’s nominee",0
423,"In his application in an already pending special leave petition of 2013 filed during former vice-chancellor Rajan Welukar’s tenure, Sawant, claimed that Kasturirangan, despite being an eminent scientist, is not from the ‘sphere of higher education’, has ‘not worked in the university academic system’, and has ‘no exposure to higher education systems in India or abroad’ as prescribed by the UGC, said Sawant’s counsel Dilip Taur",0
423,"The same was said about Gagrani, an IAS officer in the administrative field and therefore, described as lacking ‘academic excellence’",0
423,Taur added that none of the members were fit to assess the eligibility and qualifications of the applicants,0
423,"Sawant told TOI:, “The state follows UGC norms while appointing professors and assistant professors; why are they selective in the VC’s appointment process",0
423,The last VC (Deshmukh) appointed by the search committee had to be asked to step down for mismanagement,1
423,"In the past too, retired judges were appointed on the committee, who were not related to the field of academics",0
423,”But whether the current search committee will be dissolved to make way for new members can’t be said,0
423,"In the past, a search panel under the chairmanship of Professor Andre Beteille from Delhi University was dissolved by the governor as issues on the constitutional validity of the panel arose",0
423,"Later, a new committee appointed Welukar, whose appointment was questioned throughout his tenure",1
423,"“If the government goes ahead with the current committee, the appointment will continue to be under a cloud till the pendency of the case,” said an MU official",1

424,The wedding will reportedly be a private affair with only close friends and family in attendance as the couple exchange their vows according to Hindu rituals,0
424,"However, if reports are to be believed, then the couple are yet to decide if they want a grand reception to follow",0
424,"It was reported early this year that Ranveer, Deepika and their families brought in the New Year together in the Maldives, where they received the blessings of their parents",1

426,One was Deepika Padukone-Ranveer Singh and the other definitely Sonam Kapoor-Anand Ahuja,0
426,"While the former is rumoured to tie the knot sometime this year, Sonam Kapoor is likely to get hitched to Anand this month!

428,At 7,0
428,"45 am today, the much-awaited trailer of Junglee Pictures and Dharma Productions’ ' Raazi ', directed by Meghna Gulzar , will be live for the audience to see",0
428,"The film, which will open in cinemas on May 11, is an adaptation of Harinder Sikka’s novel, 'Calling Sehmat', and stars Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal in pivotal roles",0
428,"Excited about the trailer launch, Alia spoke to us about the cinematic and emotional journey of playing Sehmat, an innocent Kashmiri girl who makes the transition to spying for her country after being married off into a Pakistani officer’s family:For me, the best part is that this character is not a Lara Croft",0
428,"She’s a young, naive girl, who decides to risk her life for her country",0
428,"This was the most beautiful aspect, because I didn’t have to enact anything",0
428,Being brave doesn’t mean that you don’t get scared,0
428,"The sequences were overwhelming, but I wasn’t afraid of holding on and going all the way",0
428,A lot of technical preparation went into playing Sehmat,0
428,"I had to improve my Urdu and then unlearn what I had picked up, because I play a Kashmiri and I wasn’t required to speak chaste Urdu or Hindi",0
428,I even learnt the Morse Code by heart,0
428,"It was something Meghna believed that I should do authentically, and I feel that it helped me get perfectly into the character",1
428,"One could have argued that kisi ko kya pata chalega, but we had to be as authentic as possible",0
428,I also learnt how to drive a Jonga (a kind of jeep used by the armed forces),0
428,"Emotionally, one would have never been able to prepare for the journey I set out on, because once we started shooting, it was relentless",0
428,"We’ve shot nine scenes a day, and that’s something I have never done before",0
428,It was a lot of work without a minute to waste or think about anything else,0
428,"It’s a blessing for an actor, because you just have to be in character all the time, without any distraction",0
428,The guilt that Sehmat feels as a wife was the toughest to portray,0
428,"There were these points in the script where Meghna wrote, ‘Sehmat gives a knowing look’",1
428,I used to wonder what it means,0
428,"We used to giggle about it, but when she explained it to me, I realised what she meant",0
428,"Sehmat is around so many people, and she’s seeing and hearing so many things",0
428,She cleverly camouflages her true feelings with fake reactions that will go well with the people around her at that point,0
428,I wondered how I would give ‘that look’,0
428,Portraying a spy in the garb of a wife was difficult,1
428,"It wasn’t a very formal discussion, and when I first met Meghna, 'Raazi' was just an idea",1
428,I hadn’t read the book back then,0
428,I have never expressed interest in doing a film on the basis of a single-line narration,0
428,"She returned to me with the film 18 months later, with Junglee Pictures on board",0
428,"Coincidentally, by then, the film was also being backed by what I consider my home, Dharma Productions",0
428,"It felt nice because this was going to be a beautiful collaboration with Vineet Jain (MD, Times Group), Priti Shahani, Dharma, Meghna and I",0
428,"We set out with a vision to narrate a gritty, true story which everyone can relate to",0
428,The fact that it’s a true story will make it relevant whenever it’s told,0
428,"I also believe that whatever time you choose to tell a good story, it will have the same impact",0
428,"Whether it’s told today, or it was told in 1971, or even 10 years from now, a story like this will still find its way into people’s hearts",0
428,It’s important for people to know what happened,0
428,It will stir them emotionally,0
428,"The trailer, and eventually the film, will be relevant in every country across the world",0
428,Everyone feels the same for their motherland,0
428,"It doesn’t matter which nation you belong to, you will still love your country the way Sehmat loved hers, and I love mine",0
428,"It’s like the love you feel for a person, which means the same to everyone all over the world",0
428,"I wish everyone, all over the subcontinent and the world, watches the trailer and the film, because I think everyone will relate with the core emotion in 'Raazi'",0
428,"Yeah, I have run risks, but if I don’t do that now, when will I do it? I don’t want to live with ‘I could have’ and ‘Maybe I should have’ kind of thoughts",0
428,I don’t believe in weighing a film’s box office prospects before giving it my nod,0
428,"If my instinct says that I should do it, I go ahead",0
428,Like I really wanted to be a part of Sehmat’s world because I’ve never narrated a true story,0
428,"Of course, we all want to do films that do well, but I also have to live my life truly as an actor and for that, I have to pick different characters",0
428,"In that sense, I am selfish",0
428,I have to surprise or challenge myself with the films I do,0
428,"I know that it won’t happen every time, but I think I am attracted to that little fear, ‘Will I be able to do this?’ That forms the basis of my hunt for roles",0
428,"Fortunately, that instinct hasn’t failed me on too many occasions and it feels great that whenever I have taken a risk, it has paid off",0
428,I learnt about the sheer selflessness of people and the willingness with which they would give up everything for their nation,0
428,Look at Sehmat in the trailer,0
428,"Someone once said to me that there is no such thing as a selfless deed, but I don’t think that is true, especially in this case",1
428,I don’t think I could have played a more selfless character than Sehmat,1
428,"A parent putting a child’s interest before his or hers is a great deal, but to put your country’s interest before everything else is even greater",0
428,"The line in the trailer, ‘Watan ke aage kuch nahi, khud bhi nahi’ encapsulates a sentiment, which is difficult to emulate on screen",0
428,"It’s an extensive book because it also talks about Sehmat’s parents, Teji and Hidayat, in great detail",0
428,"So, I just read the portions, which formed the crux of our film",0
428,"While working on a film, my director becomes my mother, father, boyfriend and friend",0
428,It wasn’t any different on 'Raazi',0
428,Meghna was everything for me and we had an unspoken understanding,0
428,"We had really cracked something, which was so perfect",0
428,"Yes, my parents have been very involved with 'Raazi'",0
428,My mother ( Soni Razdan ) has even acted in the film,0
428,They’ve both seen the trailer,0
428,"The first time my dad ( Mahesh Bhatt ) saw the trailer, he was sitting a little away from our dining area and watching it intently on his laptop",0
428,"Suddenly, we heard a whistle",0
428,That’s how we knew he’s liked it,0
428,"Though my mother has acted in the film, she had tears in her eyes when she saw the trailer",0
428,"She said, ‘It’s very moving and gritty",0
428,"’'Raazi', presented by Junglee Pictures and Dharma Productions, and produced by Vineet Jain, Karan Johar, Hiroo Yash Johar and Apoorva Mehta , releases on May 11, 2018",0

429,This shocking revelation leads to a series of events which are both funny and outrageous,0
429,Review: The middle-class man is a victim of his own circumstances,0
429,"He lives a life of submission, so much so, that when presented with a situation of conflict, like Dev, he struggles to commit a crime of passion",0
429,"He resigns to his fate, or so it would seem",0

429,"It takes the common man’s daily dilemmas and puts an intriguing spin on things like EMIs, loans and failing relationships",0
429,"On learning about his wife’s adultery, Dev starts blackmailing her lover Ranjit (Arunoday Singh), who in turn blackmails Dev’s wife",0
429,More drama unfolds once other characters from Dev’s life get to know of his blackmailing plans,1
429,"It sparks a series of sorts, where everyone starts blackmailing someone else for motive",0
429,The situational humour that arises from this madcap premise is hilarious,0
429,"Parveez Sheikh (who’s written Queen and Bajrangi Bhaijaan) has his finger on the right note, and pitches the comedy in the sequences skilfully",0
429,The pace of the first half is a bit slow,0
429,"It takes time to setup all the plots, but even then, the humour stays crisp and entertaining",0
429,The second half is a laughter riot,0
429,"As each plot unfolds, the situations get bizarrely funny",0
429,Abhinay Deo’s direction is on the money,0
429,"After his black comedy Delhi Belly, he has cracked another one in this genre with Blackmail",1
429,The sublime toilet humour in this story reminds you of Delhi Belly,0
429,The music in the film (Amit Trivedi) beautifully accentuates the right scenes,0
429,"Badla, the rap featuring Trivedi and Divine has been used effectively, and it adds great energy to the narrative",0
429,"In the film, Omi Vaidya who’s back with his crazy American twang keeps encouraging Dev by saying, “shake it up” (pun intended!)",1
429,"Add to that, there’s a zany song called Sataasat with lyrics alluding to literally shaking it off! Blackmail’s quirky humour and presentation makes it a delight ride",0
429,"Irrfan gives a solid performance as the average office guy who can’t stand up to his boss, nor to his unfaithful wife",0
429,He brings an air of helplessness to his character and keeps a straight face even when he’s plotting and planning the blackmail,1
429,There’s a degree of uncertainty in his actions which comes from his goodness – and that’s what adds to the hilarity of it all,0
429,"Arunoday Singh, as the wacky track-suit wearing bad boy, is a rage",0
429,It’s one of the best performances of his career,0
429,Divya Dutta as Ranjit’s drunken and dominating wife adds to the amusement,0
429,Her scenes with Arunoday are engaging,0
429,"Also Kriti Kulhari, is decent in her part as the philandering wife",0
429,The plot of Blackmail is its hero and it manages to strike a good balance between dark and funny,0
429,"Characters are bumped off, sometimes in most gory detail and strange events unfold, but the film never loses its vein of easy, black humour",0
429,This is one of the most wickedly funny films that we’ve seen in a long time,0

453,The book’s pages will get pre-populated with images that Google has deemed to be of high enough quality or that you’ve shown an interest in previously—either by editing or sharing them on social channels,0

453,I really just want one app to manage everything,0
453,"If you’re really only going to take one thing away from this, let it be that Google Photos is a surprisingly adept tool",1
453,"Don’t get me wrong, the app has some key flaws: I always wish it would let me “favorite” photos for easy retrieval, the way Apple does, or that I could easily commission prints of single images with the tap of a button",0
453,"That aside, it’s the most versatile photo app on the market today",0

454,Spring is always the best time to take a walk in Delhi’s Lodi Gardens,1
454,"The flowers are blooming, the trees are alive, the grass is greener than ever, and the birdsong is enough to make your heart soar",0
454,"This spring though, as I walked briskly down its little winding roads, I realised that while I hadn’t been looking Lodi Gardens had turned in to a photography studio rather than the neighbourhood park I remembered it as",0
454,"To be fair, over the years, you could always find the odd couple posing for their engagement/wedding photos, looking self-conscious and embarrassed in all their finery amidst the joggers in their track pants and T-shirts",0
454,But this was something entirely different,0
454,"As I entered through the Ashoka Gate, the first thing I saw was a heavily-pregnant lady, wearing a maroon empire-line maxi-dress, posing in silhouette against one of the many monuments Lodi Gardens is littered with",0
454,"Kneeling in front of her was a man who I presumed was her husband, his hand placed proprietorially on her baby bump",0
454,"Immortalising this moment for posterity (and for the progeny) was a burly bearded photographer wielding a DSLR camera like it was an offensive weapon, while his two assistants held up sheets of white thermocol at different angles to provide the best light",0
454,I smiled indulgently at this tableau and moved on,0
454,I couldn’t have gone more than thirty paces when yet another photography session caught my eye,1
454,"This time it was a couple who looked to be in their early 30s, accompanied by a whole team of hair and make-up people, who had opened their little suitcase of products and were conducting urgent repairs on the principals",0
454,"Once the touch-up was done, one of the photographer’s assistants handed the couple a golden balloon in the shape of the number one",0
454,"They hoisted it up between them, smiled widely and said ‘cheese’ to celebrate what I can only hope was their first anniversary",0
454,"Fifty yards on, another love story was being memorialised on camera",0
454,"This time, it was clearly a proposal, or rather, the re-enacting of one",0
454,"The boy was in the now-mandatory position of being down on one knee, holding up a ring box in his right hand, while he held out his left arm in what can only be described as a Shah Rukh Khan pose",0
454,"The girl was doing her best Sushmita-Sen-wins-Miss-Universe impression, holding her hands to her mouth in mock-shock and faux-awe",0
454,They held this pose for absolute ages as the photographer captured it from every conceivable angle,0
454,Given how much effort they had put into the ‘proposal’ I was sure that their marriage would be the stuff of legend,0
454,"And thus it went, photo session after photo session, as I tried my best to meet my target of 10,000 steps",0
454,And not just that day either  this was pretty much par for the course every single time I went for a walk in Lodi Gardens,1
454,"As I trudged along, I tried to figure out what accounted for this sudden urge for ordinary, middle-class folk to conduct ‘glam shoots’ to commemorate some moment or the other",0
454,"And then, it suddenly hit me: Instagram!

Everyone knows that when it comes to Instagram, you have to look your very best, and the photo has to be of professional quality

That’s where all these photos were headed; to be posted on ‘Insta’ with a plethora of hashtags for their family and friends to ‘like’ and comment on",0
454,"And everyone knows that when it comes to Instagram, you have to look your very best, the photo has to be professional quality, so why not hire experts to do the job? Sure, it can’t be cheap",0
454,"But hey, a good photo will live on forever on Insta; and who knows, if it is striking enough, it may even go viral!

I guess this was bound to happen one day",0
454,"A movement that began with everybody taking pictures of their breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the odd fancy meal at an expensive restaurant was bound to end up with heavily-curated pictures of seminal moments of our lives, all subtly highlighted and posted on Insta with a suitable filter (X-pro or Lo-fi, anyone?)",0
454,"After all, if you post innumerable photos showing off the beautiful locations of your summer/winter vacations, then how can you ignore important milestones like proposals, anniversaries, pregnancies, etc",0
454,"? And surely, such landmark moments rate more than the usual ‘selfies’ (even if they are taken with a selfie-stick)",0
454,"No, you need to call in the professionals at such times",0
454,"So, I guess that’s why my favourite neighbourhood spot for long, lonely walks has been transformed into Photography Central",0
454,There are more glittery stilettos in evidence than sturdy running shoes,0
454,There are more shiny dresses around than there are jogging pants,0
454,And there are more hair and make-up people around than actual exercise enthusiasts,0
454,"And you know what? I love it!

I love watching those young lovers making gooey eyes at one another",0
454,I love seeing the look of pride in a young man’s eyes as he cradles his wife’s pregnant belly,1
454,"And, of course, I love the corny proposal scenarios that play out every day in front of me",0
454,"I don’t know how much these photography sessions cost (and I, for one, would never pay good money for them)",1
454,"But I do know that for sheer entertainment value alone, they are priceless",0

457,"“But I think the intimidation factor is, how do I find one? How do I find one that’s good?” Of course, one major reason people use traditional travel agents is that in case of an emergency or change of plans, a travel agent can often seamlessly and at no cost re-book flights and other trip components for you",0

474,"What do you expect from a book that claims to document, even if lightly, close to eight decades of breathless filmmaking, in just over 200 pages? Diptakirti Chaudhuri’s Bioscope, just like its quirky cover (a die-cut top layer that part-reveals, part-conceals a priceless poster of the 1958 movie Devta), is an endearing attempt at giving the reader a peek into the show-business that is Bollywood",0
474,The book debunks conventional linearity in favour of a narrative that takes up themes that have been concurrent nearly at all times in the history of Bollywood,1
474,"However, the individual chapters deal with these themes chronologically, starting from the 40s or the 50s, and culminating in the present day",0
474,"From how our favourite songs got made, how the audience’s fashion sense and that of filmstars have informed each other, to how the industry’s most memorable expats were often reduced to stereotypical characters, and how films have identified not only the audience’s pleasure points but its nerve — this book has it all",0
474,"How Zeishan Quadri, emboldened by his watching of the Brazilian crime drama City of God (2003), pitched his desi crime story set in the hinterland of modern-day Jharkhand, to Anurag Kashyap, who liked it and came up with his legendary magnum opus in two parts, Gangs of Wasseypur (2012)",0
474,"How artisans and dressmakers were flown in from Old Delhi for the grandiloquent Mughal-e-Azam (1958), so that absolute historical authenticity could be achieved in terms of the way the characters looked",0

474,"Chaudhuri suitably peppers the narrative with forgotten films and landmark art-house attempts, and garnishes with lots of humour and familiarity",0
474,"This helps to achieve readability even with chapters that some readers could find journalistic and more thoughtful than others, like the opening one that discusses box-office collections, or the concluding chapter that succinctly furnishes a sharp, concise history of modern Bollywood, right from the bloody partition that followed our Independence, the Sino-Indian war, constant acts of cross-border terrorism, the 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid, and the orgasmic moment India won the 2011 Cricket World Cup",0
474,This chapter makes for a beautiful antithesis to the otherwise lighthearted tone of the book,0
474,That the book is ‘opinionated and emotional’ helps it avoid turning into a bland collection of trivia on a film industry,1
474,"It is evident that Chaudhuri knows film industries and ways of filmmaking cannot be subjected to the same measuring scale, and this helps him to appreciate the Hindi mainstream industry benevolently, and with greater nuance",0
474,"He unearths lost gems like Haqeeqat (1964), and separates the wheat from the chaff in gloriously bad attempts",0
474,"No wonder another writer on Bollywood, Amborish Roychoudhury, credits Chaudhuri with sparking debates, in the afterword of his In A Cult of His Own: Bollywood Beyond the Box Office",0
474,"The language is lucid, and there is never a dull moment in the book, which is an asset when you’re dealing with a small page count",1

481,"When a young Gargi Devraj wonders why her father’s friends keep accidentally “brushing her here, or there” (Is it because their arms are “so much longer than women’s they have to”), her sister (who understands they’ve lost the lottery of gender and that her angelic beauty is her currency in this world) laughs and laughs till she cries and tells her “it’s because they can",0
481,"”

Halfway through Preti Taneja’s book, Gargi Devraj Grover, 33, most obedient daughter and wife, talented, conscientious, childless, successfully shouldering the charade of a marriage she was bartered into at 18, and utterly starved of affection, has her own Time’s Up moment",0
481,"Tired of collecting dead peacocks her megalomaniac father has been massacring at their farmhouse in another of his famous tantrums, and worried sick about her headstrong youngest sister who has walked out on him, she decides to stop being a bechari and give it back to him",0
481,"Or as chauvinists would say, she becomes a bitch",0
481,"Like the play, Taneja’s novel starts with the return of the illegitimate son",1
481,"Jivan Singh returns to Delhi from America after 15 years to find that the city of his childhood has grown exponentially, with high rises, swanky malls, flyovers and the metro, and that the rich here are above the law",0
481,That is the side he wants to be on,0
481,"Quick to unlearn his American way of life, he becomes an amoral agent of fate, a sort of detonator to the discontent and unhappiness in the lives of Devraj’s elder daughters",0
481,"Preti Taneja (Courtesy the publisher)

The novel is also a critique of contemporary India’s deep-rooted corruption, vast inequalities of wealth, social apathy, misogyny, and communalism",0
481,"When Devraj begins to go mad (or madder), he does not go it alone",0
481,"Through his fake anticorruption campaign, he takes the country with him as the narrative moves from Delhi to Amritsar and then to Kashmir",0
481,"The original may have been written in 1606 and set in an England of an unspecified era, but it fits our times perfectly",0
481,"Read more: Readers without borders are future of the world, says writer Preti Taneja

Taneja’s writing is fresh and lively and includes a generous bit of Hinglish",0
481,She takes the reader into the minds of each character – whether it is Jivan secretly grieving for his dead mother or a coked-up Radha trying to keep her grip on what’s happening around her – even as the narrative swirls back and forth from the continuous flow of their thoughts to the action taking place in the world around them,0
481,"At times, the need to stay true to the source material (and its vicious cruelty and absurdity) makes certain character developments and miscommunications seem forced",0

Subroto Bagchi is admired and respected for co-building a one-office, one-country IT startup to an Indian MNC with 43 offices in 17 countries in fewer than 20 years",0
485,He is an author too and this book is a treasure chest,0
485,"Bagchi calls himself a “salesperson” and generously recounts personal experiences from across the world, sharing lessons learnt, insights gained, wisdom gleaned from dozens of clients to whom he’s personally sold the services offered by his company",0
485,"He knows his onions since he’s cooked them himself or sometimes been cooked!

According to Bagchi selling is also about magic, and he’s met quite a few wizards",0
485,"Indeed, Sell casts its own spell because it is replete with the author’s encounters with wizards among salespeople and he’s spelt (pun intended!) out their wisdom for readers",0
485,This book on salespersonship could well have been conceived and delivered as a handbook or perhaps textbook targeted at thousands of students eager to rote-learn sales techniques,0
485,"Mercifully, the author abandoned such temptation and delivered a work that’s as far away as possible from a “How To” product",0
485,"Each of the book’s 30 chapters carries a serious moral or, using jargon, sales mantra",0
485,Bagchi’s crisp narration is compelling,0
485,"Lessons in the art, science and witchcraft of selling are tantalisingly camouflaged in parables unfurled with an accomplished raconteur’s panache",0

485,“I found myself in Silicon Valley,0
485,My task was to entice tech companies in the Valley to award R&D assignments to us,0
485,It was a time when most executives in American companies didn’t know where India was,0

485,"“When I look back, that win is one of the major factors that eventually shaped my destiny",0
485,” The moral: Never give up cold calling because the process keeps your spirit of inquiry alive,0
485,"Subroto Bagchi (Courtesy the publisher)

Or take this valuable insight: In sales you need to focus on three things – physics, chemistry and maths",0
485,"Physics is the matter, the form and function, the price of what you sell",0
485,Chemistry is the relationship you build with the customer,0
485,Maths is revenue and profit that come from what the customer pays you,0
485,"In this triad, it’s chemistry that’s most important",0
485,"If that isn’t in place, you won’t succeed",0
485,"Countless examples abound where wrong chemistry brought about the downfall of good products, great pricing notwithstanding",0
485,"Moral: Use the chemistry to improve the physics to deliver the maths!

And then there’s this humdinger on coping with failure: “In sales, we obsess about winning",0
485,"In truth, the scope to improve, to innovate, to break new ground requires us to fail",0
485,"But even as we deal with failure, we gloss over them",0
485,"In typical sales meets and conferences, wins are given exaggerated attention, losses are quickly buried under justifications and pointless blame games",0
485,"To keep the big picture at the centre of one’s vision, one has to develop a reflective space, the ability to step back and be authentic",0

It’s easy to judge this book by its cover",0
486,"After all, the title couldn’t be more direct – Mothering a Muslim: The Dark Secret in Our Schools and Playgrounds",1
486,So either you’re driven to read the book because your values will not allow you to escape another sad reality of life,0
486,"Or you ignore it because you’re feeling burdened by those same sad realities, and are only looking for entertainment",0
486,"Or you scoff at it because, look at those terrorists, first they kill people and blow things up, then they whine",0
486,"If you fall in the third category of reader I described above, you need to understand one thing: it’s people like you who drove the author, fashion professional Nazia Erum, to look at the precious newborn in her arms and give her little girl a name that does not identify her with the religion she was born into",0
486,"This in the hope that Myra will grow up not bullied for being a beef eater, not taunted for the existence of ‘Islamic terror’, not reviled as an enemy of the country that is her home, and never lynched for the mere fact that she is a Muslim",0

486,"(Sanjeev Verma/HT Photo)

But this rant is mine alone",0
486,It is not at all how Nazia Erum approached her subject,1
486,"For a book that speaks of increased religion-based bullying and systemic othering in schools and playgrounds particularly since 2014, Mothering a Muslim is not about blame",1
486,It’s about insights,0
486,"As Erum says in her introduction, after her daughter was born, “I wanted to know whether a Muslim mother’s worries were any different from that of her Hindu, Christian or Sikh counterparts",0
486,"What were the challenges that were exclusively hers?”

This question led Erum to interview 145 Muslim middle class families across 12 cities over a year",0
486,Much emerged about Islamophobia in schools and colleges,0
486,"But almost as much emerged about prejudices against almost all other minorities, prejudices within the Muslim community itself, the impact of ‘Islamic terror’ on ordinary Muslims, and the age-old tension between traditional community ideals and personal values",0
486,"All in all, I found more to think about in this very slim book than I have in any other of this nature",0
486,"Watch: Disturbing stories inside elite schools of Delhi

For instance, there’s the question of blame",0
486,"As one mother pointed out to Erum in an interview, how do you tell your child that her tormentor at school is just a child? ‘Just a child’ implies that a child cannot really understand the things she says and does",0
486,"Yet, the child at the receiving end knows exactly what’s going on",0
486,"Of the 118 Muslim families with children aged between five and 20 that Erum interviewed in Delhi/NCR, 100 said they’d been called ‘terrorist’ and/or ‘Pakistani’",0
486,Many were bewildered and hurt,0
486,Others shrugged and said this was the Muslim equivalent of Sardar jokes,0
486,Yet others pointed out how Dalits and other sections of Indian society face worse,0
486,"But when 85 per cent of 118 children from one community have been called terrorists or enemies of the state, it’s time to figure out what is going on, how, why, and what could be done about it",0
486,"The schools these children go to or went to are all recognisable as ‘good’, and are apparently progressive in ideals and attitude",0
486,But Erum’s interviews showed something most people don’t think about,0
486,"As entities, the schools may have cosmopolitan values, but the teachers they hire may not",0
486,And schools do not often react in a positive manner – or any manner – to complaints of religion-based bullying,0
486,Which is why many children and parents don’t complain at all,0
486,"Author Nazia Erum (Courtesy Juggernaut)

But, in fact, as Erum discovered in Bhopal, religious discrimination can run deeper in the education system than anyone believed",0
486,Take the elective third language classes that all schools must offer,0
486,Sanskrit is one of the electives,0
486,"In Bhopal, Urdu is another",0
486,"Usually, students move out of their sections to attend their elective classes",0
486,"But in Bhopal, students who take Urdu (mostly Muslim) are all in one section, and students who take Sanskrit (mostly Hindu) are all together in another",0
486,"This means that though Muslims and Hindus attend the same school, they grow up only knowing each other as ‘the other section’",0
486,They don’t share tiffins,0
486,They don’t have friends from other communities,0
486,"“Most of our friends are non-Muslims,” one of Erum’s interviewees told her",0

489,"Mukaiya is a composer of “Hassha Merodii” or “train departure melodies”, short jingles that whisk commuters on their way at some of the world’s busiest stations",1
489,"Almost no one would know his most famous track by name, a catchy electronic ditty broadcast for departures from platforms three and four at Tokyo’s Shibuya station -- the world’s third busiest -- but millions have it on their brains for hours after their commute",0
489,"Asked how many train jingles he has created, the 61-year-old former keyboard player with the jazz-fusion band Casiopea pauses",1

‘Mountain train’

“Hassha Merodii” started when train operators were looking for ways to make their stations stand out and came up with the idea of a catchy jingle",0
489,"The songs are capped at seven seconds -- the “dwell time” train operators have to cram people into packed commuter trains and still, famously, run on time",1
489,A spokesman for the JR East train company told AFP they were introduced “to prevent passengers from dashing onto the train”,0
489,"But despite the short timeframe, Mukaiya says that each ditty packs in a story",0
489,"In Japan’s ancient capital Kyoto, “we have a deep respect for culture, so the song sounds more respectful of Japanese culture,” he explained, sandwiched between musical instruments and computer screens",0
489,"The rapturous crescendo and rising pitch in Shibuya station’s departure song, on the other hand, is a nod to the train’s uphill journey to the next platform",0
489,“Hassha Merodii” started when train operators were looking for ways to make their stations stand out and came up with the idea of a catchy jingle,1

“The Toyoko line used to be up the stairs on a very high level",0

489,"‘Science fiction world’

The jingles have allowed Mukaiya to combine his two passions, music and trains",0

498,This new building will bring a new vision to the art world and to Istanbul,0

498,"For some, the museum’s sheer existence was proof that the arts could prosper in Turkey under Erdogan’s Islamic-rooted ruling party, which came to power in 2002",0

THE ORIGIN

Drag as a term was reportedly first used in 1870 with some claiming that it was an acronym of ‘Dressed Resembling A Girl’",0
499,But this claim remains disputed as there is no concrete evidence that acronyms were ever in use in the 19th century,0
499,"Yet, the word stuck and has now found its way into the Indian queer space of entertainment with an underlying message of non-conformity, trampling over the definitions of being a man, woman or the other",0
499,"“Through drag I get to show that the pronouns ‘he’, ‘she’ or ‘other’ are often irrelevant,” points out Kush",0
499,"Just about every Indian drag artiste has a strong Western influence by way of RuPaul or an Alaska Thunder F**k, both hugely popular American drag performers",0
499,"Any Indian influence is limited to language, music and names, but not from cross-dressers in the traditional theatre forms that are still alive in many parts of the country",0
499,“The context is different,0
499,"The Indian example is a form of patriarchy that denied women the stage,” says the former Mr Gay India and drag artiste, Sushant Digwikar aka Rani Ko-He-Nur",0
499,"Possibly this is why the celebrated actor from West Bengal, Janardan Nandi (whose surname is replaced with the word Rani), known for playing the role of a woman for almost all of his 75 years in theatre, uses the word ‘impersonation’ rather than drag",0
499,Not every drag queen picked this art form as some kind of choice or realisation of the self,1
499,Sushant’s connection with drag was incidental as he cross-dressed as a co-host for the Kashish Film Festival in 2015,0
499,"One thing led to another and he was soon given the drag name Rani Ko-He-Nur by Keshav Suri, who is credited with the rise of drag performances in India, given the way he has promoted them at his night clubs in Delhi and Bangalore, Kitty Su and Kitty Ko",0
499,"This has suddenly led to a variety of events – such as the Red Festival, Queer- E- Mehfil and the Bangalore Queer Film Festival – throwing in a drag show or two",0

Whether there is an ‘industry’ in the making is unknown but artistes such as Prateek have made drag their priority and want it to be accepted as a “respectable art form”",0
499,He already has a self-funded YouTube channel in place,0
499,Sushant aims to take drag to the national stage probably using media such as TV as a tool,0
499,Alex believes that there can be one drag queen for each state of India,0
499,But it all comes down to finances and sustenance,0
499,"According to Suri, he would never have imagined that when the first international drag queen – Violet Chachki – performed at Kitty Su, there would be 1,800 people in the audience",0
499,"It is no surprise then that an Indian act draws a crowd of around 500-1,000 people",0
499,"“Indians are not as close-minded as we like to pretend and portray,” he points out, suggesting that his message of ‘pure-love’ is one that will create a bigger space for drag artistes",0
499,"The queens, however, are not sitting pretty",0
499,"They call themselves sisters, unified by their distinct characters, large-size eyelashes, self-stitched outfits with sequins and anything that shines",0
499,"Many perform for free so as to garner a larger audience, making more people aware of what they do",0
499,They are happy to open their art to those who wish to come out of themselves and to get into this space,0

500,"But could the unassuming four-string instrument also incarnate the spirit of punk rock? Since forming three decades ago, the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain has helped build a new audience for what it calls the “bonsai guitar,” playing musically faithful but thoroughly tongue-in-cheek renditions of popular tunes",0
500,"Starting its latest US tour, the orchestra -- clad in evening finest, including tuxedo jackets and bow ties -- quickly pulled in dozens of smartphone-snapping onlookers as the eight ukuleleists strummed their way through AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell",0

Asked why he took up the ukulele, fellow player Jonty Bankes said, “Basically, it’s cheap and rather easy to play, so for people like us it was a godsend",0
500,"” But the self-styled orchestra has noticed a power in the tiny instrument over the years -- with gigs including two nights at Carnegie Hall, a set at the Glastonbury Festival in England and a private party at Windsor Castle for Queen Elizabeth II’s 90th birthday",0
500,"“The thing is, when you bring a ukulele out and start playing it, it does actually make people smile,” Bankes said",1
500,"“It’s an unthreatening, friendly instrument which causes a bit of happiness worldwide, really,” he said",0
500,"- Started as a joke -

Co-founded by Kitty Lux -- whose death last year at 59 brought a rare serious note to the ensemble with a memorial concert -- the group initially was interested not in the ukulele itself but in the irreverent energy of punk rock, then on its wane",0

500,"“The instrument was a bit of a joke, I suppose, and we turned everything on its head",0

500,“We don’t take ourselves too seriously,0
500,"We’re British, so we’ve got to have some sense of humor, really,” she said",0
500,"Rea fronted the group for its take of the Eurythmics’ “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),” with an amplified bass ukulele holding the rhythm under seven ukuleles of different pitches",0
500,"“It’s a good way of detecting if a song is any good,” she said",0
500,"“If you can play it on a ukulele, it’s a pretty good sign that it’s a decent song",0
500,"”

- From irony to mainstream -

Despite the orchestra’s wide travels, it has never played in Hawaii, the birthplace of the instrument initially modelled after a miniature Portuguese guitar",0
500,"The group is eager to make it to the island chain, but its failure so far to make it there is not entirely accidental",0
500,The orchestra avoids Hawaiian music -- as well as songs of early 20th-century British film star and ukulele enthusiast George Formby -- as it instead tries to surprise audiences,0
500,A man takes a picture while The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain play in Central Park,1

But the ukulele has become less of an oddity for audiences since the band’s formation in 1985",0
500,"Native Hawaiian artist Israel Kamakawiwo’ole found an international following in the 1990s with his mellow ukulele songs, while pop artists, notably the indie rock godfather Stephin Merritt, have found ample possibilities with the ukulele",0
500,"Orchestra member Dave Suich said he hoped the group has helped increase the popularity of the ukulele, especially in schools, where the little four-stringer has been giving stiff competition to the recorder as a first instrument for children",0
500,"“People younger than 40 don’t know that it’s funny,” Suich said",0

509,"According to Claire Scott, Garrard’s soft-spoken head of design, the company has had a surge in private commissions for tiaras this year",0
509,People are also waiting to see which tiara Meghan Markle opts to wear for her wedding,1

509,"She estimates her team will work on 20 custom tiaras this year, which, in this rarefied air, counts as a huge uptick",0

519,KOCHI:The ten Siberian huskies began barking in unison as Balram Menon stepped onto the sled,0
519,The time: 10,0
519,30 a,0
519,m,0
519,The place: Gorkhi-Terelj National Park at Mongolia,0
519,They set off,0
519,"On all sides, there was snow and bare brown trees",1
519,The temperature was minus 20 degrees even though it was the month of March,0
519,"Soon, the dogs picked up speed",0
519,"The Kochi-based businessman felt thrilled, as they raced through the snowy expanse",0
519,"“There is a handle which could be used to apply the brakes and control the sledge,” says Balram",0
519,A kilometre ahead was a man inside a jeep,0
519,"“His job was to keep control of the dogs,” says Balram",0
519,“If they see some animals they will get distracted and try to attack them,0
519,"So, he blows the horn and removes the animals from the path",0
519,The Huskies are ferocious dogs but they have been trained to be friendly with human beings,1
519,"”

Suddenly, the sled hit a rock hidden under the snow and Balram went flying",0
519,He had a soft landing on the snow,1
519,So he got up quickly and chased the sled and managed to get on,0
519,After an hour came the lunch break,0
519,A barbeque was lit and meat fried,0
519,"“I was feeling so hungry the food was welcome,” says Balram",0
519,"In the end, he traversed 28 kms before the journey came to an end",0
519,Balram got interested in going to Mongolia when he saw a dog-sled video on Facebook,0
519,The page belonged to a man called Bold Purvedelgar from Mongolia,1

519,"“He is one of the few Mongolians who can speak English,” says Balram",0

519,"”

519,"“It is the world’s tallest equestrian statue,” says Balram",0
519,“The horse is 120 feet high,0
519,The statue is made of stainless steel,0
519,"”

Khan is regarded as the father of the nation",0
519,"“While the rest of the world thinks he was a terror, for the Mongolians he is a hero,” says Balram",0
519,“He had the largest army in the world and conquered large areas of Asia and Europe,0
519,"”

Genghis was following a religion called Shamanism, through which you interact with spirits",0
519,"“Before embarking on a war, he would communicate with the spirits, so that he would get an idea of whether he can win the war or not,” says Balram",0
519,"“But after the conquest of Mongolia by Russia (1921-24), shamanism was completely destroyed",0
519,"”

But the traditional food and culture survive",0
519,"Balram stayed in a tent, called Ger, which is made of horse skin and hair",0
519,"“It offers a good protection against the cold,” says Balram",0
519,“They have small ovens and use horse dung for fire,0
519,"But there is no electricity, no digital communications and no bathrooms",0
519,You have to go out into the forest to do your ablutions,0
519,"”

The food is unique and different",0
519,The staple food is steam dumplings,0
519,"During winter, they have meat products, so that they can feel warm",0
519,And in summer it is cheese,0

533,"”

I thought it’s a valid point",0
533,The museum is like a large ocean packed with information and our Indian gallery is with precious Indian artefacts,0

539,Visit Rangasthalam set and the first thing you notice is its aesthetic brilliance,1
539,"Production designers and real-life partners Ramakrishna Sabbani and Mounika Nigottre Sabbani have recreated an artistic village of the 80s era comprising a government hospital, Gangalamma temple, panchayat office and houses with old potsherd roofs and mud replicating a beautiful village of Godavari in the city",0
539,"The couple takes us back on their nostalgic trip in an exclusive interview

HYDERABAD: Born and brought up in Hyderabad, Ramakrishna Sabbani’s tryst with films started with Andala Rakshasi",0
539,"After his second film Sahasam, he relocated to Mumbai and returned to Hyderabad for Kerintha and went onto allure the audience with his creativity in films like Subramanyam for Sale, Bhale Manchi Roju, etc",0
539,"So, what exactly is a production designer’s job? Ramakrishna shares, “Our work is to create a perfect ambience and the backdrop a story demands by using our imagination, colour without distracting the audience from the story and the characters",0
539,"”

Sharing how they seized the opportunity, Ramakrishna and Mounika explain, “Impressed with our work in Jyo Achyutananda, Sukumar approached us for Nannaku Prematho",0
539,But we couldn’t grab the offer due to other commitments and finally collaborated for Rangasthalam,1
539,"When Sukumar narrated the script, we realised that it will be an ambitious film in our career",0
539,"We visualised the film, the texture, colour hues and design it should have in the discussion stages and planned everything accordingly",0
539,"Besides production design, we have handled the art direction for Rangasthalam too",0
539,"”

Interestingly, the duo didn’t take any references to build the set and everything was conceived from their own imagination",0
539,"“Before arriving at what we thought would be appropriate for the film, we have sketched the village to make Rangasthalam possible",1
539,"As 90 percent of the film has to be shot in the set, every day was a challenge for us",0
539,We had six assistants working closely with us,0
539,"Given the budget and time constraints, we have delivered everything on time",0
539,"As creative people, we have to constantly analyse our work and improvise the concepts, if needed",0
539,We ensured that there won’t be any room for mistakes with our meticulous planning,0
539,"Also, Sukumar is sure of what he wanted and he was involved in every aspect",0
539,That made the things easy,1
539,"”

Terming Rangasthalam a special film of their career, Ramakrishna and Mounika recall, “The film has an interesting, yet nostalgic design with props",0
539,The emphasis is always on realism,0
539,"Since the film was set in the 80s, nothing from that era is available in the market",0
539,"So, we have decided to create everything from the scratch",0
539,"The rats, roofs, wooden gates, doors, cool drink trays, Frooti pack, Horlicks box, cool drink, trays were all the work of the production department",0
539,The village set cost `5 crore and 400 people worked for two months,1
539,"”

The real challenge of craftsmanship came while marking",0
539,“The outdoor was a rocky terrain with only two trees,0
539,"So, to come up with all the designs and placement of each thing in line without imagination was really difficult",0
539,We spent many days working on the modalities,0
539,We started the shoot when summer was at its peak and continued to work under different weather conditions,0
539,"I must say, it was an enriching experience,” recalls Ramakrishna",0
539,"Mounika, who hails from Delhi, says there were no references to those years and it’s was tough to gather all the material at hand",0
539,"“At times, Sukumar, Ram Charan and others were surprised to see the things on set which they have seen in their childhood,” reminisces Mounika",0
539,"So, from where did the duo obtained these things? she says, “We have procured some items that ruled our lives in the 80s from some antique shops in Rajahmundry",0
539,"We also salvaged old building materials like windows, doors, vintage trunks, chests from the locals",0
539,"We have got brass vessels, antique iron spatulas, bowls, jugs and other kitchen utensils in exchange for new ones from the villagers",0
539,We have used three trucks to transport all these things to Hyderabad,0
539,"”

The BFA graduate from Hyderabad, Ramakrishna says it’s tough to shoot in a remote village",0
539,“We shot in a village near Polavaram and it was difficult to reach the location in the early morning and return to Rajahmundry in the nights,0
539,We travelled on boats carrying all the equipment and worked till late at night,0
539,"There were no mobile signals and if we have to call someone, we have to place a call at the nearest post-office",0
539,"We tried to hook an antenna for mobile signal but after some days, it was knocked off due to heavy wind",0
539,"So, it was impossible for us to co-ordinate without phones",0
539,"Imagine a 400 member team including Ram Charan, Samantha living without any facilities and external communication",0
539,"With a lot of determination, we braved all the challenges and experienced the life of the 80s (smiles),” reveals Ramakrishna",0
539,"He adds, “Some villages we shot in were submerged due to Polavaram project",0
539,"So, if one has to see the green cover of their villages, they should watch Rangasthalam",0
539,"” Working on a film of this magnitude is not an easy job and at times, some differences may crop up between technicians",0
539,"Ask Ramakrishna if there was an instance which required him to convince or persuade Sukumar? He explains, “There is no room for arguments or differences whatsoever",0
539,We had a plan and our only job is to make sure our director’s conviction comes true,0
539,Everything went on really smooth,0
539,"I take this opportunity to thank Sukumar, our producers and other crew for supporting us in all endeavours",0

546,"Ishaan Sachdeva, Director at Alberto Torresi, Tabby Bhatia, Director at Voganow, and Harkirat Singh, MD at Woodland, have listed tips to make your travel lighter:



* Though slip-on shoes make everything faster at airport security, it is often recommended to wear your heaviest shoes when travelling",0
546,"These account for half of luggage weight, so it's a big saver of space! It may take more time in the queue, but the sacrifice is well worth it for the saved weight and space",1
546,* Try to find versatile shoes that will mix and match with all your outfits,0
546,* Think outside the bag,0
546,"Tie laces together and loop shoes onto the outside of your backpack, instead of packing them inside",0
546,"Not only does this save room, but it lets smelly shoes breathe",0
546,"* When trying to figure out how to pack shoes for travel in a small bag, stuff smaller items and accessories into the shoes to utilise every available inch of packing space, and to prevent them from getting crushed",0
546,"If you're not stuffing, pack pairs of shoes tightly together, soles out, with the heels at opposite ends",0
546,* Determine what activities you will do on your trip so you pack the appropriate footwear for the climate,1
546,"* Limit your colours to brown and black, as they go with anything",0
546,"Besides, dark colours help hide scuffs and stains",0
546,"If you pack a matching belt, you'll always be in practical style",0
546,* Put the pair of shoes in a large plastic bag,0
546,Not only will this save you from digging through your luggage for a lost shoe but it will also help to keep your luggage odour-free,0

547,It takes merely two hours to cover a distance of around 96 km from the bustling city of Ahmedabad in 21st century to the forgotten town of Lothal that flourished in mid-third millennium BCE,0
547,"Lothal is akin to a once valuable clock, a childhood artifact, gathering dust in the attic stuck in a time reminiscent of happy memories and unfulfilled dreams",0
547,"It has been nearly 4,000 years since boats sailed upstream from the Gulf of Khambat on the River Sabarmati and its tributary Bhogavo to Lothal in search for etched carnelian beads, seals and sealings, shell, ivory, copper and bronze objects that were in high demand in Western Asia",0
547,"The boats took advantage of the high tide to reach this important trading town, unloaded their goods on a wharf adjacent to the dockyard, reloaded the goods earmarked for export and rode the waning tide to the Arabian Sea",0
547,"The trade route navigated along the Gujarat coast halting at ports like Bet Dwarka before heading further west to Sindh, Baluchistan and Gulf of Oman ultimately entering the Persian Gulf",0
547,"Today, it is perplexing to imagine this riverine character of Lothal as the ancient river has disappeared though the ruins of dockyard and an adjoining warehouse still exist",0

547,Decaying foundations are sole remnants of splendid structures that stood here aptly signifying the futility of human endeavours,1

547,"But what do we know about the humans that inhabited this town? What were their aspirations, their festivals, their joys and fears?

When we come across the ornaments worn by women of Lothal or a terracotta bull and horse that might have been prized possessions of a child, we are overwhelmed by a strange tinge of sadness",0

The director says that even if it is a story or article, she always had the habit of finding out more about the lifestyle, mannerisms and history of those associated",0

548,"While what remains of the Jain relics are mostly caves, going back to the eighth century, a Devi temple was later erected in the area by the then Travancore ruler, Sree Moolam Thirunal explains the filmmaker",0
548,It was the desire to let the public know more about Chitaral led her to work on it,1
548,"Winding up, she says, “There are many who don’t even know about the significance of the place, While Jainism and Buddhism is mostly associated with China and other Asian countries, the site became under the jurisdiction of the ASI",0

549,“They usually come from Philippines or Vietnam,1
549,"”

The Japanese have a huge respect for India",0
549,"“Since most Japanese are Buddhists, they revere India as the land of Lord Buddha,” he says",1
549,“They know about Mahatma Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose,0
549,"”

The youngsters have a different attitude",0
549,"“They feel India is growing so fast, at 7 per cent, compared to Japan’s 2 per cent, so they are thinking about how they can invest in India, and make money,” says Tiby",0
549,But some misconceptions do exist,0
549,"Since there are many North Indian restaurants in Tokyo, they feel that all Indians eat naan every day",0
549,"“For them the curry we have is either vegetable or chicken,” says Tiby",0
549,“They are surprised to know that we eat with our hand,0
549,"After watching movies, they feel that there are a lot of animals on the streets",0
549,"”

Tiby, who is originally from Kothamangalam, has been living in Japan for the past 19 years",0
549,"He is the CEO of a company called Pinmicro, which provides indoor GPS platforms",0
549,"His partners are two Malayalees, Jayaraj T G and Gijo Sivan",0
549,"They provide digital solutions to improve efficiency in the workplace, be it offices, factories, warehouses or hospitals",0
549,He gives an example,0
549,"“In a confectionery factory, the management wanted to ensure that every employee who enters the factory should have an air shower (this is usually done at entrances to remove particles on the clothes), followed by a hand-wash with alcohol to get rid of germs,” says Tiby",0
549,The company had placed cameras all over the factory,0
549,But then they realised that nobody can look at the cameras all the time,0
549,"But through Tiby’s GPS platform, if a person forgets to do a hand wash, an alert is immediately initiated",0
549,"“Hence, he or she cannot enter the factory premises,” says Tiby",0
549,“This will ensure employees who enter the work place are always clean,0
549,"”Asked whether this constituted an invasion of privacy, Tiby says, “We are not recording anything",0
549,"”

Meanwhile, when asked the advantages of working in Japan, Tiby says, “The technology is at an advanced stage",0
549,The transportation is very efficient,0
549,It is a clean and safe country,0
549,”And the people have a social attitude,0
549,"During the devastating earthquake which hit Tokyo in 2011, there was a water shortage",0
549,The government instructed that everybody would receive two bottles of drinking water every day,0
549,"“They would only take the amount specified by the government and not more,” he says",0
549,"“When there were widespread power shutdowns, there were no reports on any thefts in the numerous shopping areas, which would have happened in other countries",0
549,The Japanese are a very self-disciplined people,0
549,"”

But there are negatives too",0
549,"“It is difficult to work in Japan since people only speak Japanese,” says Tiby",1
549,“It took me a few years to learn the language,0
549,"”

The business model is still the old industrial style",0
549,"“So everybody follows what the boss says,” says Tiby",0
549,“But that time is over,0
549,"You have to work fast, make decisions quickly, and be innovative",0
549,"”

And Tiby can notice the ‘falling behind’ effect when he goes to the malls",0
549,"Ten years ago, when he went to buy a mobile phone, there were Japanese products from Sharp, Casio and Fujitsu",1
549,"“Now, it is only Samsung and Apple, and a few Japanese brands,” he says",0
549,"“Many American, Korean and Chinese companies have gone past the Japanese",1
549,"”

Another problem for the Japanese is the declining birth rates",0
549,"“The number of children per couple in Japan is very low,” says Tiby",0
549,“A small work force will have to feed a lot of elderly people,0
549,This will become critical in the next five years,0
549,"So, the government is doing a lot to attract Indian talent to Japan",0
549,There are a lot of Indo-Japanese events taking place in India as well as Japan,0
549,"”

However, Tiby says that even though they live in Japan, the Malayalis are preserving their culture",0
549,"“For Onam, last year, 500 people gathered and we had sadya and other celebrations,” says Tiby who is married to Nigi and has two children, son, Johaan, nine-and-a-half and daughter Jewel, 7",0
549,"Asked his future plans, Tiby says, “I plan to work for the next ten years in Japan till my children reach university",0

552,"In a scenic drive of fewer than 30 minutes from the Amsterdam airport, we reached a beautiful Country Estate – ‘Landgoed Duin & Kruidberg’ (try pronouncing it!)",0
552,"This lovely property ensconced in the woods has turned from the once princely hunting grounds to five- star hotel, restaurant and convention centre all rolled into one: it has an interesting history and many exciting tales to tell",0
552,The fairy tale Old-Dutch style monument takes one back to the 17th century when many Amsterdam traders boasted rural estates like this,0
552,Its oldest known owner Hendrik Reijnst was with Dutch East India Company,0
552,The estate changed many landlords from governors to ministers to politicians  it became a hunting lodge  underwent changes from baroque to typically British,0
552,What impressed me most was its priceless art filling every corner,0
552,Its four beautiful period rooms were my favourite haunts as I would walk through them or recline in a seat and sink in the old world charm,0
552,My room had a pretty view of the pond where ducks were swimming the whole day,0
552,"On the way to the Brasserie in the basement, I would often stop at the statue of Moses and give him an admiring look, silently appreciating the sculptor",0
552,My introduction to Dutch cuisine happened rather interestingly,0
552,"In their Michelin starred restaurant De Vrienden van Jacob, the chef sent me a starter that tasted like our much loved “masala vada”, one of the many gems from the South Indian “evening tiffin” repertoire",0
552,"When I enquired after its history, the young, enthusiastic waiter went to the chef and came back with the recipe: it is made of buckwheat and powdered macadamia nuts, deep-fried to a golden brown",0
552,"Then came a “sago papad” like fritter, which reminded me of home, of the heavenly rasam, hot rice, melted ghee and potato chips: the waiter went to and fro again to get me the info – it is made of the stuff used for the outer cover of spring roll",0
552,"That’s all, I didn’t bother him anymore, though he looked at me questioningly after serving each course – I relaxed and enjoyed my first Dutch meal that ended with the most delicious and sinful chocolate-caramelised banana combo with peanut butter",0
552,I threw caution to the squally winds outside and indulged without an iota of guilt,0
552,"That afternoon, as a storm raged with the gustiest winds, we set out to visit Zaanse Schans (another tongue twister?), which is a unique mill village that brings together many important elements of Dutch heritage from the Zaan district",0
552,Numerous mills and historic houses have been collected here and restored to their former glory,0
552,"Along with the Old Dutch crafts like clog making, cheese making, and pewter casting, it provides a good impression of Netherlands’ rich history",1
552,We had a memorable tour of this place: more memorable because of the weather,0
552,"Fighting against a cruel gale, holding my upturned umbrella with all my might, I saved myself from being blown away by the strong winds!

As we strolled past, clutching the flying umbrellas of course, the 18th and 19th centuries were brought to life and the smell of fresh bread wafted across",0
552,Entering the 17th-century cheese farm “Catharina Hoeve” was like stepping back in time,0
552,"Dressed in the traditional Dutch costume, a charming lady demonstrated how the world famous “Gouda” cheese is produced in accordance with a very Old Dutch recipe",1
552,We tasted different types of cheese after gaining considerable knowledge on the subject of Dutch cheese,1
552,The farm shop was set in a charming ambience – I bought lots of cheese and some souvenirs to take back home,0
552,The De Vrede warehouse from the 18th century now houses a clog maker’s shop and clog museum,0
552,"In a fun-filled demonstration, the handsome young man with a winning smile showed old clog making craft that magically transformed a plain block of wood into a lovely wooden shoe",0
552,"The accompanying clog museum houses the finest collection of antique clogs in the Netherlands, accumulated over the years, including many unusual specimens, like authentic carved bride clogs, work clogs, and the famous Hindelooper church clogs from 1675",0
552,"To take back home, I bought many pairs of tiny and very pretty clogs made of porcelain and wood: quite different from the usual fridge magnets which either end up fighting for space on an overcrowded fridge door or sit wrapped and unnoticed in the kitchen shelves",0
552,"In this Dutch location, there were several working windmills producing paint, oil, wood and mustard, attractive little shopping streets lined with authentic, green painted wooden houses",0
552,"This is certainly Holland at its best!!

560,"KATHMANDU: While the reconstruction of various heritage sites around the Kathmandu Valley remain mired in controversy, the ten-year-long restoration of the Sundari Chowk, an example of the grace and ambition of Newar Architecture, is now complete and open to the public, a report in The Kathmandu Post has said",1
560,"It is almost three years now that the devastating earthquakes hit Nepal, ravaging and terrifying the people and the landscape",1
560,"Rebuilding has been slow, the government lagging, the head of the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) has changed multiple times due to political wrangling, and most people seem apathetic of the government’s will to really help its people",0
560,"Amid this morass, it is worth mentioning that the Patan Durbar Square and its adjoining palace complex is busily being repaired with dozens of people at work every day on 12 ongoing restoration projects—repairing and rebuilding the monuments and artefacts damaged by the earthquakes",0
560,"The multi-crore-rupee Patan Durbar Earthquake Response Campaign (2015-2021) launched just a day after the quake by the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust (KVPT) aims to restore the entire square and the Patan Palace by the year 2021, contingent on available funding",0
560,"Today, walking across the square, instead of rubble, there is labelled scaffolding, describing the institutions or individuals who have generously given to the 26-year-old Trust",1
560,"While the furore over who should rebuild the iconic and beloved Kasthamandap (our Valley’s namesake situated in a still devastated Kathmandu Durbar Square) continues, the KVPT quietly rebuilds: One of its first major accomplishments was to repair and restore the fallen and squashed copper repoussé statue of King Yognarendra Malla to its place on the pillar looking east towards the three-storey Degutale temple",0
560,"While work continues around the square and the palace complex, the KVPT’s ten-year-long restoration of the Sundari Chowk (2006-2016), long considered the most beautiful courtyard in the Valley and an example of the grace and ambition of Newar Architecture at its best, is now complete and open to Nepali nationals for an entrance fee of Rs 30 which covers a visit to the Patan Museum’s Keshab Narayan Chowk, the Mul Chowk (or main courtyard), and the now complete inner-most Sundari Chowk, accessed via the Mul Chowk or circuitously through the gardens that are home to the also restored Bhandarkhal tank and its intricate stone pavilion",0
560,"The travails of fund-raising and gathering expertise for the restoration of this storied courtyard are recorded in a beautiful, scholarly book published by the KVPT as documentation for future restoration efforts—but for those who are not necessarily engrossed in the essentials of architectural history and are just enamoured by magnificent edifices, an unparalled use of space and light, a window into an exemplary of Newar architecture, the artistic traditions encapsulated within it, and a unique, innovative example of converting a palace into a museum, the beautiful courtyard is waiting to be visited",0
560,"The adaptive re-use of the 17th Century (thought to have been first built in 1627 CE) southern most addition to the Patan Durbar made by King Siddhinarsingh Malla, now includes within its restored walls an architecture gallery that houses a permanent exhibition illuminating the tradition of Newar Architecture",0
560,"For those who may want to see how the Sundari Chowk itself may have been conceived and constructed, along with galleries with mud-floors and exposed wall paintings have been left untouched by the restorers so that the public may experience the feeling of bare feet on finely laid mud, an aspect that has now been taken over by brick tiling in an emulation of tradition that is not strictly accurate but more practical: The mud floors in the Sundari Chowk must only be stepped on without shoes and the galleries are closed weekly for maintenance in order to keep these fragile floors intact",0
560,Today the Sundari Chowk is an emblem of a decades-long dream to establish architectural galleries within it—celebrating the arts that house them,1
560,"The permanent collection in the grey painted Architecture Gallery, curated by Niels Gutschow, holds works of drawings and carefully recreated architectural edifices that seek to elaborate how former generations set about creating components of palace spaces such as the Sundari Chowk",1
560,"As the Patan Museum, a former part of the palace restored by Götz Hagmüller, contains modern elements re-imagined to further enhance a contemporarily curated collection, so does this newly opened architectural gallery create fresh opportunities for larger pieces that can hang in spaces that would never have been used otherwise",0
560,"The North, South, and West Wings of the Sundari Chowk had been completed by the time the earthquake struck in April, 2015; they remained intact due to the structural fortification during the restoration (construction began in 2009, the former two years were devoted to fund-raising), holding despite the violent tremors",0
560,"The as-yet unrestored East Wing collapsed, and it is this wing that was reconstructed with loving detail in keeping with the fortuitous documentation that had preceded its collapse",0
560,"The East Wing now houses the double storey Architectural Gallery that is an example of adaptive re-use, creating a venue hitherto unseen before, similar in intention to the glass pyramid juxtaposed in front of the former palace that houses the collection of the Louvre; a choice now widely admired even while its detractors would have had it removed",0
560,"The Sundari Chowk is now available for big, ambitious exhibitions that the previously dark palace interiors could not have housed, in keeping with its analogue in the galleries of the Patan Museum which hold an open-air staircase that is bracketed by the glorious struts of the Bhai Degah Temple that may never have been seen at eye level in an older, lower ceilinged gallery structure",0
560,"The restoration of the Sundari Chowk has accounted for and followed in the tradition that allowed its own organic adaptive evolution from palace complex, destroyed multiple times over the past four centuries, to the prison and Malpot office that it once housed before its restoration as an annex to the Patan Museum",0
560,"If you have missed this painstaking, thoughtful, exquisitely documented restoration, that followed the stringent rules of the government run Department of Archaeology, it is now time to go and see it for an experience of what can be accomplished given the will, the vision, the discipline, and of course the funding",0

573,"Wait, what?

According to a new study by St",0
573,"Michael's Hospital, carbohydrates get a lot of bad press and blame for the obesity epidemic, but this negative attention may not be deserved for pasta",0
573,"Unlike most 'refined' carbohydrates, which are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, pasta has a low glycemic index, meaning it causes smaller increases in blood sugar levels than those caused by eating foods with a high glycemic index",0
573,"A team of researchers undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of all of the available evidence from randomised controlled trials, the gold standard of research design",0
573,"They identified 30 randomised control trials involving almost 2,500 people who ate pasta instead of other carbohydrates as part of a healthy low-glycemic index diet",1
573,"""The study found that pasta didn't contribute to weight gain or increase in body fat,"" said lead author John Sievenpiper",0
573,"""In fact analysis actually showed a small weight loss",0
573,"So contrary to concerns, perhaps pasta can be part of a healthy diet such as a low GI diet",1
573,"""

The people involved in the clinical trials on an average ate 3",0
573,3 servings of pasta a week instead of other carbohydrates,0
573,One serving equals about one-half cup of cooked pasta,0
573,They lost about one-half kilogram over a median follow-up of 12 weeks,0
573,The study authors stressed that these results are generalisable to pasta consumed along with other low-glycemic index foods as part of a low-glycemic index diet,0
573,They caution more work is needed to determine if the lack of weight gain will extend to pasta as part of other healthy diets,1
573,"""In weighing the evidence, we can now say with some confidence that pasta does not have an adverse effect on body weight outcomes when it is consumed as part of a healthy dietary pattern,"" said Sievenpiper",0

575,Mushrooms that have been used medicinally for centuries are one quirky ingredient for coffee,1
575,"Apparently, the brand leading the charge is Four Sigmatic",0
575,"Company’s founder, Tero Isokauppila explains health benefits of variety of mushrooms",0
575,"He dwelled on the kinds like reishi, a mushroom he says will keep your skin healthy, chaga, which he says is rich in antioxidants, cordyceps, which he says enhances performance, reported the Washington Post",0
575,"Not restricted to coffee alone, mushrooms are found in other beverages like shakes and tea as well",1
575,"For instance, wellness cafe in Los Angeles, such as Lifehouse Tonics lets you order a “shroom shake” or a lemon juice tea with mushrooms in it, the report said",1
575,"The mushroom coffee is purportedly an anti-inflammatory, and is supposed to regulate blood sugar levels and boost metabolism",1
575,"However, registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Mascha Davis, said, “There is some research showing some beneficial utilities in some mushrooms, but I think some of these companies that want to sell them overstate the benefits",0

576,"BENGALURU: For those who aren’t sticklers for tradition when it comes to food, this special sushi menu by Fatty Bao is a good way to push the limits of your palette",1
576,"Called ‘Sushi Unrolled’, the menu includes sushi pizzas, tacos, pita pockets and more",1
576,We started the meal with the Cross-breeding Tuna pizza,0
576,"The rice is made into a flat cake and lightly fried, and is topped with thin slices of marinated tuna, jalapenos, cream cheese mayo, capers and mustard dressing",0
576,"The flavours were subtle and blended well together, but personally, we think this pizza can go either way with customers - you either love it or hate it",0
576,Next was the pita pocket version of sushi - and we tried the veg and non-vegetarian options,0
576,"Called Inari sushi, the sushi rice is wrapped and seasoned in deep fried tofu pockets",1
576,"The Progressive Vegetarian had miso lotus root, smoked tofu, cucumber and sweet potato crisps - a great combination of flavours and textures, with the lotus root adding that much-needed crunch",0
576,"The Liberal Tobimayo - the non-vegetarian option - was filled with a generous amount of crab meat, mayo, chives, avacado, shallots and topped with prawn crackers",0
576,"This, while tasty, was extremely filling, a bit too heavy, we thought",0
576,"While the Inari is a great option for those with a mighty appetite, the tofu pocket had gotten soggy with the sheer number of fillings inside",0
576,"We tried the sushi taco next, where the outer layer is made crispy like a taco shell",1
576,"We tried the Spicy Salmon option, and the crispy outer layer made the overall texture of the dish stand out",0
576,Our personal favourite were the sushi rolls - called Hosomaki sushi - which were also served beautifully,1
576,We tried two options - the Grilled Soy Braised Wild Mushrooms and Cheese and the Teriyaki Chicken and Togarashi,0
576,"Both were delicious and though the cheese might scare some off, it really blends well with the dish",0
576,"Overall, we enjoyed having our tastebuds teased with the different innovations of the sushi",0

577,I experimented for about six months before I realised that I could do this on a daily basis,0
577,There are many unique ingredients one comes across during one’s culinary pursuits,0
577,"The ones that have simply awed me for their distinct character, aesthetic beauty and flavour are fiddle head ferns and morels",1
577,I came across both in my hometown Uttaranchal,0
577,"Mushrooms being one of my favourites, I would definitely think of morels as one my most favourite ingredients",1
577,Morels are edible sac fungi or simply put ‘mushrooms’ - the beauty is that they can’t be cultivated,1
577,"They are hand picked and harvested, the complex symbiotic relationship these wonderful fungi have with trees cannot be replicated in an artificial environment",0
577,"The flavour is earthy, nutty, meaty and intense but never over powering",0
577,"They truly satisfy every quality one looks for - olfactory, visual, taste and texture",0
577,Like the saying goes ‘morels are everywhere and impossible to find’,0
577,I have never had a chance to forage for them but was gifted a few hundred grams by a close friend and a few hundred grams of fresh morels are a treasure not to be taken lightly,0
577,"I love them sauteed in butter and seasoned with sea salt and if I really feel adventurous, then have them with soft gooey eggs as an accompaniment",0
577,"I have never been able to serve them at our restaurant (except on our Christmas menu which was well received), because of the difficulty in procuring them",0
577,I would like to actually go to the mountains and forage for them myself one day - that would be a fantastic culinary adventure,1
577,The positive feedbacks helped too,0
577,Now I’m a director and chef at Forage,0
577,The food we offer here is also quite different from the others in the city,0
577,"My partners, Mayura and Rajnish, are all runners and swimmers",0

577,"When I got into competitive running, I changed my outlook towards the way I look and maintain myself",0
577,"I stopped having dairy products, processed food and anything that had preservatives",0

The Mini twist

Having a lazy day and plan to eat some delicious north Indian food? Meet Mini, an enterprising home chef",0
578,"Cooking, for Mini, is synonymous with adventure",0
578,"When Mini got married, she was clueless about cooking",0
578,"So she decided to take the ladles, spoons",1
578,"and other kitchen accoutrements in her own hands, and start cooking",1
578,"""I used to watch a lot of food-based videos, read recipes and try it at home",0
578,But every dish had a Mini-twist,0
578,"This slowly became my passion,” she says",0
578,Mini's husband and her eight-year-old son have been silently supporting her,0
578,"“I must say at eight, my son has been very understanding, he is aware that I love cooking and has adjusted a lot",0
578,My husband takes care of our son while I complete my orders,0
578,"”

Malai methi, paneer butter masala, rajma chawal, aloo mutter… name it and Mini can cook it up in just 45 minutes",0
578,“I accept instant orders and take around 45 minutes to one hour to finish my cooking,0
578,"I do not believe in saying no to my customers,"" says Mini",0
578,"Mini has been in the business for 10 years, “But my learning has not stopped, I continue to learn as I get new orders",0
578,I left my career in a corporate firm and took this up,0
578,"And now my motive is to learn baking,” she says",0
578,"On weekends, Mini tries out different cuisines at various restaurants in the city",0
578,“I am a big-time foodie and I love to eat out,0
578,"I make sure my Saturdays and Sundays are to eat out with my family,” she says",0
578,“Onion and garlic are two ingredients that add a lot of flavour to any dish,0
578,"I once got an order from a Jain customer, who did not want onion or garlic in their food",0
578,I took that up as a challenge and gave my best,0
578,And my customers were more than just happy,0
578,"”

Although Mini does not offer door delivery, in exceptional cases she does accept one or two delivery orders",0
578,Her package ranges from about `120 to `150 that serves one 250 ml of subji,0

579,“I have always cherished memories of celebrating Easter,0
579,"I was the youngest of eight children in my family and I would observe my mother and sisters taking care of all the preparations,” says Celine Joseph, who along with her husband runs Celine’s Kitchen, a catering service base in the city",0
579,"Easter is special in every Christian household; spending a day in mourning on Good Friday, waking up early the day after to attend Easter mass, followed by waiting to get back home to dig into the food set on the table",0
579,"“When I was younger, we would wake up to go for the 3 am mass and then come back, make appams and break our lent",0
579,Now things have changed— mass timings and duration have become shorter,0
579,"But what has not changed is the tasty food that we make every Easter,” says Benny Joseph",0
579,The Easter feast that follows the lent and Good Friday are most awaited in Christian homes,0
579,"While the dishes may change in each country and/or state, what is common is the abundance of non-vegetarian dishes",0

579,"She is from Kuttanad, which is in Alappuzha district of Kerala",0
579,"“In Kuttanad, the main dish is the duck and karimeen, as both are available abundantly",0
579,"They weigh more than what we get in the shops here,” points out Celine",0
579,"Although they stick to their traditional recipes, Celine admits that after moving to Chennai and cooking for people from different regions, she has added a few extra dishes to the list",0
579,"“Some people want a few vegetarian dishes or may want a different kind of chicken curry,” she says",0

580,"NEW DELHI: You're about to eat your mid-work chocolate snack and then you see a white, powdery or streaky substance on the surface of your afternoon delight",1
580,"What is this stuff?

Firstly, this doesn’t necessarily mean the chocolate is old, or inedible",0
580,This white ‘thing’ on the chocolate does not mean that the chocolate is mouldy,1
580,It means the chocolate has suffered from something called the “bloom”,0
580,There are two kinds of chocolate bloom: fat bloom and sugar bloom,1
580,Sugar bloom occurs when moisture comes in contact with the chocolate,0
580,The chocolate that you eat typically contains sugar,0
580,Fat bloom is more complicated and may be caused by a combination of factors,0
580,"These include improper storage conditions, changes in temperature, or poor tempering",0
580,"In fact, this strange phenomenon, known as “fat bloom”, is all down to how we store our favourite chocolatey treats",0
580,It happens to be the biggest cause of customer complaints and costs the chocolate industry millions of pounds every year,1
580,"So, what can you do to prevent it?

To properly store your chocolate, an ideal situation is to keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place, such as a cellar or pantry",0
580,"If you live in a hot, humid area and you don’t happen to have air-conditioning at your place, store it in the coolest place in the house, typically a lower cupboard or a dark pantry",0
580,You can carefully wrap and seal your chocolates in a couple of layers of plastic wrap or ziplock bags to keep moisture and odors out,0
580,"Lastly, you can also seal the bags in an airtight container, and then place it in the warmest spot in your refrigerator, often the top and middle shelves, toward the front",0
581,"A year ago, restaurateur Rushad Ginwala was contemplating a fresh radical menu for a new restaurant he was launching in Ahmedabad",1
581,"He already owned the American diner-themed restaurant chain, Tomato’s which serves international cuisine",0
581,"Mirch Masala, his North Indian speciality restaurant brand had expanded across Ahmedabad, Vadodara and other cities",0
581,"“I wanted to innovate, but also didn't want to drive business away from my existing brands,’’ explains Rushad, “I love Parsi food at home, and food served at the homes of my many friends of whom, some are Sindhi, Gujarati, Maharashtrian, Rajasthani, Mangalorean and Tamil",0
581,You don’t get to order most of these regional dishes in any restaurant in Ahmedabad,0
581,"’’

Experience had taught Rushad that restaurants serving regional Indian food with a modern take on traditional recipes, dishes plated in the western style and fusion food were wildly popular in the big cities",0
581,"“I love Mumbai’s vada pao, Irani café-style kheema pao and Goan sausage pao with twists and tweaks,’’ he says",1
581,"Hence, the enterprising culinary maestro settled on the innovative oeuvre as the bill of fare for his new restaurant",0
581,"After many discussions with his team, Rushad named it ''Dhoom Dhaam",0
581,"'' Interior designer, Ariane Ginwala was told to envisage a décor that reflected the theme—regional cuisine presented in a modern style",0
581,"Dhoom Dhaam has contemporary interiors, monochromatic walls and modern streamlined furniture decorated with traditional motifs with brass accents",0
581,Even the utensils are modern-ish with a subtle Indian touch,0
581,"The highlight of the place is an installation of lights made with traditional brass and copper thalis that show off the mood of eponymous celebration, and is accompanied by hanging lamps",0
581,Displays of wooden ladles and a collection of mortar-and-pestle sets extend the food metaphor,0
581,"“The restaurant was soft-launched in mid-2017, and we keep experimenting with novel culinary versions from different regions—Ratalu Nariyal Pattice and Titora-Khakra from South Gujarat, Jodhpuri Mirchi Vada from Marwar, Paniyaram from the South, Nellai Kozhi Varuval from Tamil Nadu, Dabeli from Kutch, Dhansak of the Parsis, Sai Bhaji of the Sindhis, Prawn Gassi from Mangaluru, Meen Pollichathu from Kerala, Batatyachi Bhaji-Amti-Shrikhand which is a classic mini meal in Maharashtra, Saoji Chicken from Nagpur, and so forth",0

581,"""

The restaurant has photographs of the city of joy on its walls, and is full of props of Kolkata buses and taxis",0
581,’’ Patel doesn’t serve Bengali food though,0
581,The menu is Kolkata-style Mughlai food,0
581,"“Our customers come for Egg Rolls, Mutton Rolls, Mughlai Paratha, Mutton Chaap, Aloo Dum in the Kolkata street style, and of course, the Kolkata-style Chicken Biryani",0
581,Snacks such as Egg Chops and Chicken Cutlets are a hit,0
581,"His clients are not just Bengalis and former Kolkata residents, but are also Sindhis, Punjabis, Gujaratis, South Indians,’’ he says",0
581,"Meanwhile, Chaitanya Dalvi has brought the cuisine of Mumbai to Ahmedabad through the nostalgically charming restaurant he owns called Madhavrao",1
581,"Dalvi explains, “Growing up in Mumbai, I loved Maharashtrian food and local street eats",0
581,"Though my main business is textiles, I started a restaurant serving such dishes",0
581,"’’

In 2018, he launched ''Madhavrao,'' which has been designed to give the look and feel of aristocratic homes in Maharashtra or Goa",0
581,"Chaitanya was also inspired by the décor of the colonial period clubs of Mumbai: carved wooden cabinets, colonial-style tropical dining chairs, polished wooden tables, brick-clad walls, wooden partitions with compartments carrying spice and food jars, antiques, artefacts and ornate light fittings",0
581,The walls of the Madhavrao are festooned with ancestral photographs and portraits,0
581,An impressive wooden staircase leads to the second dining area that is largely used for parties and groups,0
581,"The menu includes Maharashtrian snacks like Sabudana Vada, Vada Pao, Kothimbir Wadi, Dadpe Pohe, Misal and pancake-like Thalipith",1
581,"The entrées are eclectic—Zunka Bhakri (chickpea flour porridge served with rice bhakri), Bharli Vangi Puri which is a substantial one dish meal of stuffed eggplant with puri, Bataka Dungli Biscuit Bhakri and Masalabhat Tamatar Sar",0

587,BENGALURU : The concept of ‘bowls’ in the food world has been a blessing for those of us looking for some comfort,1
587,"All your food needs are met in a single large bowl, and you can even share them with people",0
587,"Our latest visit to Mamagoto, with their Mama’s Bowl Manifesto menu, captured exactly those emotions",1
587,"With eight veg and non-veg options, these bowl meals are designed to satisfy all your Asian food cravings",1
587,"We headed over to Mamagoto on a crowded night, and started our meal with duck stuffed baos",0
587,"The baos were tasty, and the meat was well-flavoured",0
587,"After a rather long wait, we were brought two vegetarian bowls — Tofu 2 Way and Medium Hot Mushroom",1
587,The first bowl had tofu cooked in pepper sauce another version that was prepared with salt and pepper and served with udon noodles and veggies — a generous portion and flavours that screamed comfort,0
587,"Our personal favourite from the night was the Medium Hot Mushroom bowl - assorted mushrooms, chilli reduction, spring onion, udon noodles and dry red chillies",0
587,"We couldn’t put our forks down, as the different textures of the various mushrooms paired with the udon noodles, took us back to a rainy night where you’re sitting in front of the TV with your loved ones and have ordered Chinese takeout from that place you love around the corner",0
587,"The Aromatic Rice Meal Fish was next, and comprised a homemade chili sauce, a chunk of fresh fish, served with Jasmine fried rice and rocket salad",0
587,"While we found the sauce to be a tad bit too salty, the rocket salad was much-needed to balance out the excess sodium chloride",0
587,"The Hot China Action was another bowl we tried, but don’t let the fiery pictures fool you",0
587,"This dish, which is made up of slow-poached chicken with Schezuan chili oil and served with ginger and scallion sticky fried rice, doesn’t quite pack the punch you’d expect if you’re looking for something spicy and flavourful",0
587,"The poached chicken needed to be doused with a more than generous portion of chilli oil for the flavours to come through, but on that note, we did enjoy the sticky fried rice with its mild flavours of ginger and spring onions",0
587,"Other options one can go for are the 8 treasure Bowl Lamb, In Da (Canton) House Pork and the Aromatic Rice Meal and Tofu",1
587,"The menu is on till May 20, starting at `599",0
588,"BENGALURU : When we go a store to buy cheese for that fancy dinner party we’re hosting, we rarely think about all the effort and time that goes into fermenting milk to get that perfect gouda, cheddar or parmesan",0
588,"One man changing how we look at cheese is Aditya Raghavan, whose fascination for the dairy product has taken him on journeys of discovery, exploration and lots of cows!A former physicist, Aditya says that he has always had a love for food and cooking",0
588,"Experimenting with making cheese, bread, beer and curing meat at home as hobbies, Aditya, who was a postdoctoral fellow in Canada, quit this and worked on cheese farms",1
588,"“I lost interest in research and teaching, which is when I decided to do something in food",0
588,Working on two different cheese farms in Canada helped hone my skills,1
588,"I learnt so much about farming and about raising animals at these cheese farms, skills that are rare to acquire in India,” he says",0
588,What drew him towards cheese was the process of making it,0
588,"He says that he was ‘fascinated’ by how milk could be kept away for months, after which it gives you something so different and unique",0
588,"Talking about favourite cheeses to make and eat, Aditya chooses two French cheeses — Époisses to eat and Tomme to make",0
588,"“Tomme is a French cheese that has simple, creamy flavours",0
588,"And the natural flavour of the milk really comes out in it,” he says",0
588,Having journeyed to many places on cheese quest,0
588,Aditya says that one experience on a cheese farm in California will always be a fond one,0
588,“A Portugese family settled on the outskirts of San Francisco will always be one of my fondest cheese memories,0
588,I remember driving up to the rustic farm with the strong smell of manure everywhere,0
588,The cheese cellar there was filled with all these amazing aromas,1
588,"Now, each time I visit California, I make it a point to go there",0
588,"”

While he says that cheese made in Himalayas is good, he says that India is not suited for making the Western style of cheeses",0
588,“Making cheese requires a cool environment for fermentation to happen,1
588,The ideal temperature inside a cheese cellar is 10-12 degrees,1
588,"While the cheese you get in Kodaikanal, which is quite popular, isn’t bad, there is nothing cutting edge about it",0
588,"One can still find some good cheese being used in the northeast, as yak milk imparts a nice flavour to the product",0
588,"”

Aditya says that he has no plans on starting his own cheese farm, and wants to continue being a cheese consultant",0
588,"Talking about what this entails, he says, “As a consultant, I go to farms that are engaged in selling dairy products such as milk and ghee, and are looking to add value to their products",0
588,"I take them through the entire process of cheese making — from how to set up a cheese cellar, how fermentation and aging work to the actual business part of it where they have to sell their products",0
588,"”

In India, Aditya says, consumers are not very knowledgeable about cheese yet, but this is changing",0
588,"“The most popular kinds of cheeses here remain gouda and cheddar, and fresh cheese such as mozzarella and feta",0
588,"However, people are slowly starting to open up to various other kinds of cheeses now",0
588,"”

Aditya will be at Foodhall, 1MG Mall, on Sunday from 12 noon to 2pm, to take guests through platters of various cheeses and how best to pair them and with what",0
589,"HYDERABAD: For those who love their food to be local, health and inexpensive, there is a new concept of solar dried food",1
589,The All India Women’s Conference (AIWC) was on a mission to promote the usage of these solar dried products in homes at an event at Hotel Baseraa in Secunderabad recently,0
589,"AIWC joined hands with Ohris Group of Restaurants to prepare different dishes using their Solar Dried food products, such as Solar Dried pasta, Solar Dried Tomatoes, onions, bhindi, methi leaves, Palak etc",1
589,"Chef Amey, Chef Amar and Chef Archit took the lead in helping the guests understand the concept and the making",0
589,The programme was attended by women from various NGOs that are partner organizations of AIWC in the City,0
589,"Sunita Bhagwat, Commissioner, Tourism, Telangana state, was the guest of the day",0
589,"Three other organizations displayed their Solar dried foods, and two experts Dr Bamji Mahtab, Retd NIN officer and Nutrition scientist and Dr Srinivas Chakravarthy, Physicist who manufactures solar driers, spoke about the promotion of Solar Dried products in the market",1
589,"Supriya Bhalerao, Secretary of AIWC conceived the idea and executed it",0
589,The President Farida Hussain and other committee members explained the need for such products,0
589,"“Usage of Solar Energy in general, has become the necessity for the countries of the World",0
589,A lot of effort is going into generating power using solar energy,0
589,Women can use solar cookers and driers for cooking,0
589,"They can dry vegetable and fruits, also different foods, in solar driers on a small or a big scale",0
589,They are dried in a scientific and hygienic manner to store in homes,0
589,"The purpose is to have it available in our kitchen in an emergency, or in off-season, or for quick cooking,” they elaborated",0
589,"Drying in these gadgets not only preserves the nutrients in food, but also restores the flavour and its taste",0
589,"Thus, as compared to the food that is dried directly under the sun on the terrace, solar dried food is more hygienic, dust free and tastier, the session concluded",1
589,These products can be soaked in warm water for 30 minutes to rehydrate and put to use for making various dishes,0
589,"AIWC, a 90-year-old organisation working for the upliftment of the women and children, having its head office in New Delhi, trains women in solar drying, helps them make the products and market them",0
589,"Currently, no grocery stores stock solar dried products and there is a need for more women to come forward, get trained and start this as a business that has future",0
589,All participants concurred with this and showed willingness to do whatever is required for the promotion of Solar Drying,0
589,It was also agreed upon that the representatives of different organisations will come together and form a group which will work towards the objective of producing popularising the solar dried products,0
589,The branch in Hyderabad runs a Working Women’s hostel for the women from AP and Telangana and a free primary school for the children of the under-privileged parents,0
589,"The centre has a vocational training centre, a low-cost sanitary napkin production unit in Chevella and a solar dried product unit in Hyderabad",1

590,"Youssef’s research showed a direct correlation between certain ingredients and improved mood, with different elements, including texture and colour, also yielding positive effects",1
590,"The most popular mood-boosting meals ordered in India include creamy pasta, ginger chai, oreo shake, chocolate grill sandwich, mango ice cream, badam milk, chicken popcorn and a fish meal",1
590,The data further reveals that ordering of these mood boosting meals peaked at 8 pm on Sundays in India,1

591,"For the past half-hour, we’ve been treated to a walking tour of a 50-year-old bungalow in T Nagar, now revamped into a pure vegetarian traditional restaurant, Paati Veedu",1

591,"Dining area of Bhakshanam

“This is an experiential restaurant, where one can sit for two hours, enjoy a large five-course traditional meal with family and friends, and feel like they’ve gone back in time,” says Agnelo Vijayan, one of the partners behind the project",0
591,"Paati Veedu was conceptualised by Dubai-based Sirish Ramkumar, his brother-in-law G Mohandas, Agnelo, and a large bunch of friends and family who took care of different parts of the project",0
591,“We always wanted to do a huge 14-ground project complete with a traditional arts village,0
591,"Now, we have started with just the restaurant phase of it,” says Agnelo",0
591,"They identified this old bungalow a year ago, and structurally and aesthetically redesigned it",0
591,"“It used to be a ground-floor only house, which they kept expanding, so it’s a little maze-like and easy to get lost in, on your first walk,”Agnelo laughs",0
591,"But who wouldn’t mind getting lost in this maze of traditional carved wooden doors, Karaikudi stone pillars, antique radio sets and delightful kolams on red oxide walls?

As we speak, a waiter brings a shot glass of paanagham, a traditional refreshment drink, and we’re introduced to Sangeetha Mohandas, who curated the menu",0
591,"“The restaurant was conceptualised around the menu because the founders wanted to bring back age-old recipes,” she says",0
591,"Sourcing menus from all their friends’ and their families’ grandmothers, the kitchen team worked on creating the best combinations, over nine months",0
591,"“For example, mor kozahmbu with paruppu usli and keerai is a great combination,” Sangeetha says",0
591,"The menu has five types of sambhar; five types of kozhambu such as vatha kozahmbu, milaghu kozhambu, bonda potta mor kozhambu; rasams like pepper rasam, nellika rasam, murungakka rasam",1

592,CHENNAI: I have been extremely passionate about food and cooking since my childhood,0
592,I would always watch my mother cook,0
592,I learnt from her that cooking is also an art,0
592,So I decided to pursue my passion as my career and in 2003 I was appointed as a South Indian chef at a popular hotel,0
592,"I have worked in a couple of places including Malaysia, Hyderabad and Chennai",0
592,There are are lot of cuisines in South India and I cook them all,0
592,"But, my specialities are Chettinad and Andhra cuisine",0
592,"Although they might seem similar, there are a lot of differences between them — be it in terms of the ingredients used or the flavours",0
592,Both these cuisines are spicy and make use of lot of dry spices,0
592,But the way they are used to give flavour to the dish is entirely different,0
592,"For instance in Chettinad cuisine, traditional spices like black stone flower, peppercorns, are used, whereas in Andhra cuisine hot spices like Guntur chilli, garlic, are used",1
592,"Another difference is that in Andhra cuisine, we use a lot of salt and there are many varieties of pickles and chutneys",0
592,Most of the Southern cuisines follow a similar cooking method,0
592,The difference comes in the intensity of the spices used or the substitutes each one uses to give a different flavour,1
592,"For instance, in Kerala cuisine, we primarily use coconut oil as the base, whereas in Chettinad it is mostly gingelly oil and in Andhra cuisine we use refined oil only",0
592,Rice is a staple food in all the Southern States is something we all know,0
592,"However, the kind of rice that is used differs in each State — for Chettinad cuisine we use jeeraga samba rice, for Andhra cuisine we use ponni raw rice",0
592,Event the meat used differs in each State,0
592,So these little elements define South Indian cuisine,0
592,During my stay in Malaysia I realised that most people there prefer our cuisine and they love our spices a lot,1
592,So it was indeed a pleasure to cook for them,0
592,In Malaysian cuisine they don’t use rich spices like we do,0
592,They use a lot of lemon grass,0
592,So our dishes seemed something new,0
592,I was particular not to tamper with the authenticity of my dishes,0
592,I don’t like to play around with the flavours,0

As we walk towards a group of women, who are meticulously working, Ramya, (25) a BCom graduate, is busy cutting a fresh batch of feta",0
593,"“I love everything about cheese making and I have learnt to do everything! It’s such an enjoyable process,” she says using sign language, as her co-worker translates it for us",0

593,The duo was recently awarded the Nari Shakti Puraskar 2017 for providing livelihood to women with disabilities and empowering them,1
593,“We initially thought that the call was a scam,0
593,"It was only after an official mail that we convinced ourselves that this was real,” says Anuradha",0
593,"“We met so many women with such inspiring stories and it’s a memory we will cherish forever,” shares Namrata",0

593,"Namrata recalls, “During a brief stay in Coonoor, I learnt to make basic varieties of cheese like feta, mozzarella, and halloumi",0
593,"When Anuradha discussed her idea with me, I thought why not teach them to make cheese?” That’s how the plan began and it was fuelled when they received a call from Karen Anand, to be part of her first Farmer’s Market in Chennai",0

593,"They have over 20 varieties of cheese which are infused with lip-smacking flavours including mustard, chilli, mango and cumin seed, thyme and whatnot!

594,"The word is derived from yuga (era) and aadi (beginning) in Sanskrit, which loosely translates as the beginning of a new period",0
594,"Apart from visiting temples to seek divine blessings, giving gifts and decorating the entrances of the houses with floral designs or rangoli and fresh mango leaves on this auspicious day, the locals also indulge in some special food specifically prepared for the occasion",0

594,It serves as a reminder to the people that life has all kinds of experiences ranging from sweet to bitter,0
594,"Some of the ingredients of the pachadi are tamarind, jaggery, margosa flowers and leaves, chillies, salt and raw mango",0
594,"In some homes, the preparation is more liquid, while some prepare it like a thicker chutney",0
594,"The dish also has medicinal values

and works as a coolant, and is said to prepare you for the ensuing hot summer",0
594,"Apart from the pachadi, few other delicacies are also specially made for the festival",1
594,"Mamidikaya Pulihora or raw mango rice is a seasonal preparation, as green mangos start being available during this time of the year",0
594,"Many people even follow a custom of not eating mangoes before Ugadi, and thus this is the day when they are tasting mangoes from the new season for the first time",0

600,"The Nawab was exiled to Metiabruz, a suburb in the British capital city of Calcutta where he came with his huge entourage and set up his residence",0
600,Among them were his khansamas and rakabdars who had to cook his favourite Awadhi Biryani for the members of this team,1
600,"However, the financial situation of the Nawab did not permit maintaining the same meat ratio in the dish",0
600,Meat was expensive and the bawarchis replaced them with potatoes to bring down the cost,0
600,"Though fund constraints seem to have been the reason for the inclusion of potato in the Nawab’s biryani, another story talks about that potatoes at that time were sought-after vegetables added just to bring a variation to the recipe",0
600,"The variant was appreciated and thus was born a new version of biryani known as Calcutta Biryani in which the rice and the meat are cooked partially, and the potatoes are fried, before the biryani is layered in a handi, and put on dum",1
600,The moist biryani relies more on the flavour and has vless masala as compared to its Hyderabadi counterpart,1
600,It is light on the stomach usually enjoyed with sides such as chaap or pasanda,0
600,"Saffron, kewra water, and mitha attar are some of ingredients used for its typical fragrance",0
600,"Over the centuries, the dish became popular in Kolkata and around, with many versions seen in popular Kolkata eateries like Royal Indian, Shiraz, Arsalan, and Aminia with differentiation, for example, Royal Indian Restaurant still serves biryani without the omnipresent potato, whereas Aminia has a version which has a taste closer to the Awadhi counterpart",0

606,"The kids who easily identified the logos of international food and beverage brands such as McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Coca-Cola, were more likely to request and prefer the processed foods marketed by these international corporations, the findings showed",0
606,"""Our findings draw attention to the insidious and pervasive nature of marketing and how it impacts children's health,"" said principal investigator of the study Dina Borzekowski from the University of Maryland in the US",0
606,"""Why would a five year old say that they want a Coca Cola over a lassi? Kentucky Fried Chicken over a stir-fried chicken and vegetable dish made by mom?"" Borzekowski said",0
606,"For this study, Borzekowski and colleagues gathered information from 2,422 children between age 5 and 6 years from India, Brazil, China, Nigeria, Pakistan and Russia",1
606,The participants were shown pictures of media characters (both internationally and locally popular ones) and they were asked to identify those pictures and characters,0
606,The researchers found that three-fourths could name Tom and Jerry and two-thirds could name Mickey Mouse,0
606,"They also did a matching activity, where children were shown cards with different logos and asked to match each card with the item it might represent",0
606,"Overall, about 60 per cent were able to associate the Coca-Cola swirl with an image of a soda glass",0
606,"To assess food preferences, the research team showed children two similar products -- one international and one domestic -- and asked which product they would want",1
606,They also had children rate how much they desired a variety of domestic and international products,1
606,Character and logo recognition in young children was consistently and significantly related to the selection of international over domestic and local food and beverage options,1
606,"The influence of logo recognition was even stronger than that of media exposure, the study found",0
606,The researchers believe that understanding the reach of global and international marketing and its impact on food preferences could help inform public health approaches to reverse trends of growing childhood obesity,0

607,Aurat banaye tho farz hai” chides Sridevi in the film English Vinglish,0
607,"It loosely translates to “If a man cooks it’s an art and when a woman does, it’s her responsibility",0
607,"” Shivani Verma, the chef and owner of Granny’s Art Cafe in her own way challenged this cliche",0
607,"“We all grow up with the conditioning that the women of the house cook and if and when the men cook, it’s a reason to celebrate,” says Shivani who grew up eating her grandmother and her mom’s food",0
607,"Love conquers hate

A heartfelt story and a very specific incident is what made her turn cooking into a livelihood despite hating it earlier",0
607,"“To be honest, I never liked cooking",0
607,"I never even went into the kitchen before,” narrates the 33-year old who now runs the kitchen at Granny’s Art Cafe",1
607,“My grandmother on the other hand loved cooking and sought happiness in feeding us,0
607,"And oshe cooked like a dream! When she passed, I started to miss her and the food she cooked so I started experimenting in the kitchen",0
607,"One day my father ate what I cooked and said, ‘You cook like your grandmother’",1
607,"And that’s when I decided to dedicate a restaurant to her memory,” she says",0
607,"More than a business

“It’s probably in a woman’s nature to be nurturing,” she says thoughtfully",0
607,“It’s never been just a business for us,0
607,We have people who have been coming in for a meal everyday since a year,0
607,We get requests off the menu too,0
607,"Even the interiors are what we made ourself and designed,” she chimes",0
607,"And when her customers praise her food, she feels just a little more closer to her dear grandmother she admits",1
607,"It’s still a man’s world

Although Shivani has seen the ups and downs of the business, and has been managing her business with her own intellect and strength now, she admits that in the real world it can be scary",0
607,"“I was a reserved person before I started the business but the job has taught me to be more assertive,” she says adding, “It’s a problem to get employees, vendors and chefs to take me seriously",0
607,They have a condescending tone and an demeaning attitude towards a woman in charge,0
607,I as a reserved person was scared out of my wits because of this,0
607,But as time progressed I realised that this is how it’s going to be and that I have to make my stand and be strong,0
607,” Shivani wants to send out the message to all the women trying to make their mark in a man’s world: “Don’t be afraid,0
607,People will drag you down and make you doubt your capability just because you are a woman,0
607,But believe in yourself and don’t let them get to you,0

608,"Previously a security guard at an apartment, she joined Howard Johnson, a four-star hotel in Hebbal",1
608,She worked as a kitchen stewardess for three years before becoming a professional pastry chef for the last eight months,1
608,"“I was fascinated with wearing a chef’s hat, and wanted to do more challenging work than kitchen

stewarding,” she says on how she ended up in the baking industry",0
608,"She found the baking department in the hotel a very interesting place to be, and began learning the art during her off-duty hours",0
608,"“Baking is a more challenging job, what we create is consumed by guests and appreciated",0

608,“Between 4,0
608,30pm and 8,0
608,"30pm, I learnt baking",0

609,"Yes, you read it right and it tastes like hazelnut-chocolate spread",1

The company has come up with this unimaginable ghee by mixing cacao, from which chocolate is made, with coconut sugar to sweeten it and then combining it with date syrup and company's own Madagascar Vanilla Bean Ghee",0

610,Annamalai is a relative of Bhagyalakshmi who runs the Ramassery idli shop in Palakkad,1

610,"He said, “In our village, we use wood-fired chulhas to cook the idlis",0

611,"“To recreate a typical street experience, we wanted our actors to interact with the audience better… the audience had to stand closer to the actors,” says Aruna",0
611,"“The stage is divided into different sets, each for one kind of street food, and the audience keeps moving to follow the narrative",0
611,"”

The best part is that, while enjoying the play, a viewer can munch on different foods -- from jhaal moori of Kolkata to sundal from Chennai and paan from Benaras, these are cooked/prepared to authentic recipes",0
611,"The actors cook, with ingredients from the particular state, during the run of the play",0
611,"The theatre group is aware of the social disparity between the performers and their subjects, and have taken extra measures to ensure that there is no ‘mockery’ of vendors",0
611,"For one, actors perform wearing masks, which were moulded with the help of an artist based in Chennai",0
611,"Aruna says, “With a mask, this character’s story can be everyone’s story",0

It has been noted that the number of dine-in customers has decreased significantly over the last few years, with customers mostly opting for home delivery",0

614,As we started our conversation with Uttam Tripathy of Potli—an Indian restaurant in London—we were reminded of the film Cheeni Kum,0
614,"Remember, how the movie starts off with the fiercely proud owner of an Indian restaurant, Amitabh Bachchan, boasting of his knowledge about Hyderabadi Zafrani Pulao? Uttam’s passion for serving authentic and impeccably-cooked Indian dishes to the westerners called for the comparison",0
614,"In fact, The Week voted it as one of the 24 best Indian restaurants in London in 2017",1
614,The 40-year-old native of Odisha’s Sambalpur district is on a mission to popularise Indian market cuisine in the West,0
614,"Until 1995, Uttam had no clue about the hotel or food industry",0
614,It was luck by chance that he cleared his interview for an integrated course in Hotel Management at Kolkata’s Taratala to become a part of the Indian Institute of Hotel Management,0
614,"As he puts it himself, ‘out of nowhere’ he was selected for the institute’s Chennai campus",0
614,"And, that’s how he set on a voyage of good food",0
614,“No one had ever opted for hotel management in my family of engineers and professors,0
614,"But, I have enjoyed being with people,” he says",0
614,"The restaurant and the staff members

Setting up Potli wasn’t an overnight affair",0
614,He faced a fair share of struggle before striking the right note,0
614,"With memories of Sambalpur etched in his mind, he left for Delhi to realise his dreams",0
614,His associations with some of the reputed hotels in the national capital helped him learn the tricks of the trade,0
614,"However, his insatiable hunger for entrepreneurship took him to London in 2004",0
614,"“I faced a tough time for more than a year, when I first came to London",0
614,People who brought me to the city didn’t keep their words,0
614,"Soon, I had no job,” Uttam recollects",0
614,"Fortunately, he bumped into a client, who hired him for launching a bar-cum-Indian restaurant in north-west London",0
614,"He transformed a dying old English pub into a swanky yet traditional Indian bar, Blue Ginger",0
614,“I wasn’t happy deep inside working for others,0
614,"With nothing in hand, I quit my job in 2010",0
614,Along with a friend I was knocking on the doors of investors and banks to secure investment for my project,0
614,Everyone rejected us,0
614,"Finally, I met a bank manager, who approved the loan,” he shared",0
614,"It took another six to seven months for the duo to refurbish the place and finally Potli was launched on August 15, 2011",0
614,He never looked back since,0
614,The restaurant was rated one of the top Indian restaurants in London by Tatler in 2013,0
614,Potli’s dal makhani was named as one of the top 5 Indian dishes by Hardens,0
614,"It hosted several celebrities, including Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in 2011",0
614,"At Potli, Uttam had tried to popularise the commercial Indian dishes, sold at marketplaces",0
614,"The concept was inspired by the famed biryani brand of Hyderabad, Paradise; Tunde Kababi of Lucknow; Alkauser of Delhi and of course, the quintessential Indian dhabas",0
614,"But, what motivated Uttam to start an Indian restaurant to tickle the taste buds of Britons? The entrepreneur with a typical Indian facial morphology took a deep breath before he answered that",0
614,"Much to his surprise, he says that he discovered that the Indian restaurants in London weren’t selling genuine dishes",1
614,"They had, as he claims, either Anglicised or transformed the dishes into something very hot and spicy to give Europeans a ‘high’ after a few shots of tequila on a Saturday date night",0
614,“Indian food was considered to be the cheapest in the country,0
614,"The pocket-friendly chicken Madras, balti chicken, chicken tikka masala and vindaloo defined Indian cuisine, thanks to the curry houses here",1
614,"But, none of these were truly Indian,” he adds",0
614,"For instance, the vindaloo, which is primarily a tangy Goan pork delicacy, was being cooked with chicken, prawns or lamb",0
614,The word vindaloo originated from vinegar and garlic,0
614,"However, the curry houses there had apparently turned it into the hottest dish, served with unidimensional heat of red chili powder",0
614,"It wasn’t a challenge for Uttam to introduce the cuisine in London, home to over 10,000 Indian restaurants",1
614,The real challenge was to bust the myth surrounding it,0
614,"In fact, Uttam has come a long way from when an English couple left Potli for not finding balti chicken in its menu to serving pani puri, vegetable chops, shammi kebab and a lot more Indian stuff to the westerners",0
614,"And much like Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge’s Amrish Puri, Uttam sticks to his Indian side",0

615,"C: Planning to go on a vacation? Sometimes, vegetarians and vegans can struggle to find decent food while staying in a hotel that also has non-vegetarian food items",0
615,"Fret not! Many tour operators are there to help you, especially if you are a vegan",0
615,"Travel firm VegVoyages was launched in 2004, offering three trips in one country",0
615,"The firm, which specializes in vegan adventure tours in Asia, now runs up to 23 trips a year in five different countries in 2018",0
615,"Based in Texas in the United States, it is one of several operators across the world catering to the growing market of ethical tourists, who are seeking to experience different cultures without harming animals, exploiting people or destroying the environment, The Forbes reported",0
615,One unique thing about vegetarian and vegan vacations is the sustainability and responsible living while enjoying vegan foods served in some hotels exclusively for such tourists,1
615,“There’s definitely been an increase in the demand for vegan travel,0
615,"More people around the world are warming up to vegan ideas, concepts and benefits who were previously put off by the mere mention of the word ‘vegan’, much less considering it as a full-time or part-time diet in their daily life,"" said VegVoyages co-founder, Zac Lovas",0
615,"""This directly fuels vegan travel whether it’s more vegans searching for vegan travel options or more non-vegans not fearing to be on a tour with vegans and eating vegan meals for one or two weeks at a time,” Lovas added",1
615,Lovas stated that food is one of the biggest incentives for travellers to start a vegan tour,0
615,"“People don’t want to go to a country and be able to only eat side dishes and salads, or be stuck eating the same thing that they eat back home",0
615,One of the benefits of travelling on a vegan trip is to be able to enjoy eating what the locals eat and not having to worry about whether or not it’s 100% vegan,0
615,"You can still get a glimpse into the local culture and history through the community’s cuisine on a vegan adventure,” he explained",0
615,"Popular destinations for vegan tourists include- India, Bali and Sumatra in Indonesia and Laos",1
615,The age range of tourists varies from 18 to 80 years and include both single and couples from all walks of life,0
615,"Owing to the increasing demand, Lovas's travel firm has increased its group size from just eight people to 18",0
615,"According to Lovas, during the first seven years of running the company, most people identified themselves as ‘vegetarian’",0
615,"But, many others consider themselves as vegan nowadays",0
615,"Approximately 75 percent of the tourists are vegan, while 25 percent are non-vegan, the latter typically comprising of friends or spouses of vegans, or those who are health-conscious",0
615,The company’s repeat customer base is between 70 to 80 percent respectively,0
615,"Tour operator Tierno Tours in Concord, North Carolina, has also seen a rise in demand for vegan travel",0
615,"In 2010, it ran the first of its annual Vegano Italiano trips to Italy",0
615,These trips became so popular that the company launched Vegan Travel Club soon,0
615,"In 2016, in collaboration with veteran eco-vegan travel agency Green Earth Travel, the company added new destinations to its 2017 calendar",0
615,"The new destinations included Peru, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico",0
615,"The tours feature a range of activities, such as celebrity vegan speakers, plant-based cooking demonstrations, and visits to wineries and heritage sites",0
615,“Because we have a lot of repeat business we try to develop different tours every year,0
615,"Some, like Italy and Ireland, we continue to do every year, and others, like San Francisco or Peru, are a one-time deal",0
615,Some of our choices are based on prices and some places become more favourable because airfares go down or money exchanges are to our advantage,0
615,"Locations also come in and out of favour,” said Vegan Travel Club co-founder Gretchen Sheridan",1
615,"""Right now, Ireland and Scotland have become very popular due to a lot of movies and hit TV shows being filmed there",0
615,"Berlin, Rome and Barcelona are also big attractions because of the sheer number of vegan eateries there,” Sheridan added",0
615,"Donna Zeigfinger, the owner of Green Earth Travel celebrated its 20th-anniversary last year",0
615,"Having experience in working in the travel industry for the last 30 years, she said that people have been enquiring on vegan vacations and adventure trips, along with a large demand for vegan festivals, culinary tours and health conference tours on cruises",0
615,Vegan vacations are not only confined to land-based tours,0
615,A first plant-based cruise was recently announced by Australia,0
615,"In 2017, the world’s first all-vegan cruise took place from London to Norway, carrying 1,881 guests from 34 countries",0
615,"This was organized by German company Vegan Travel, which specialises in river and ocean cruises",1
615,"“A lot of my clients used to be the honeymoon couple where one was vegan and the other wasn’t, or the one child in the family was the vegan",0
615,"Now it’s the couple where both are vegan or the whole family’s vegan,” Zeigfinger added",0
615,"“When it comes to accommodation, hotels must consider more than just food",0
615,Hotels need to be accommodating when it comes to things like bedding,0
615,"Most nowadays will provide allergy-free bedding, so that means no feather pillows or wool blankets",0
615,Most of the tour operators these days now have a better understanding of what a vegan is and will go out of their way to accommodate people,0
615,"If not, we don’t use them again,” she explained",0
615,Managing director Dirk Bocklage has come up with the idea of hosting murder mystery dinners and theatre events and performed on cruise ships,0
615,"One of the newest players in the vegan vacation market is CPG Vegan Trips, a travel firm which allows tourists to spend some time with animals without causing them any harm",0
615,"Founded by the renowned animal advocate and author Colleen Patrick-Goudreau, it hosted its first wildlife trip for 22 people to Thailand in October last year",0
615,"The company plans to launch more such trips this year, with North Vietnam and the Alsace region of France being on the agenda",0
615,It has also recently sold out its first trip in 2019 in just two days to Rwanda in Africa,0

618,"Pushing the numbers a bit further is Dosart, Kilpauk, which boasts around 111 flavours",0
618,"“We added paneer tikka, pasta and Maggi varieties of dosa too, which no one else is doing in the market,” claims Anish Akkalaneni, co-founder, Dosart, that was launched last month",0

633,Fiber binds to the waste and toxins within the digestive tract and pulls them out from the body through regular bowel function,0
633,* Prevent diabetes: Consumption of black rice is a much healthier option than processed carbohydrates which are stripped of their fiber and thus slows down the absorption of sugar in the bloodstream,0
633,"Whereas, black rice contains the entire bran of the grain where the fiber is stored, and fiber is able to help glucose (sugar) from the grain to be absorbed by the body over a longer period of time",0

634,It comes served on a hot naan giving the wrong expression of perhaps the oldest version of a pizza,0
634,"Shares chef Anaida about the dish Esfahan Beryani, “Instead of biryani, it’s called beryani which means ‘roasted in fire’",1
634,The anecdotes say that beryani travelled to the subcontinent with the Mughal emperors and changed its form with the addition of rice which may have happened while the soldiers moved from one place to another and to prepare a wholsesome meal for them rice might have been added,0
634,” It has become so popular now that its original form is almost forgotten,0
634,And the dish changes its flavours and texture according to the geographical location it is prepared in,0
634,"Interestingly the spices added in the mutton of the beryani are just cinnamon, saffron and pepper",1
634,The addition of other spices in the dish must have happened due to the trade links between Persian region and parts of the subcontinent,1
634,"The trail of pomegranates and berries continued with Persian Chicken Bowl consisting of Chicken Jujeh Kebab, chicken chunks cooked in tomato sauce and berries served with sauteed vegetables like cucumber, bell peppers, broccoli, and baby corns",0
634,The whole presentation was a complete and nutritious meal in itself,0
634,"Anaida, who has Persian-Greek and Indian ancestry shares further, “Also, Haleem is a popular breakfast item in Iran which is cooked slowly with very few spices",0
634,"” Other than these dishes we recommend the singer-director-actor-chef’s Soop-E-Jadooi, a chicken soup at whose bottom you discover the treasure of pearl barley sprouts, turnips, mushrooms, carrots and corn",0

635,"The fascinating thing about Mayavi has been her ability to reverse diabetes, hypothyroid, high blood pressure, acute vertigo and asthma just by opting to eat whole plant based food",0
635,It has been 4 years since she had to be hospitalised for her illness,0
635,"After consultation with her friend who runs an organisation called Freedom from Diabetes, she opted to choose a vegan lifestyle",1
635,"However, the only hurdle was that she’s a foodie and wouldn’t touch anything that did not taste good",0
635,"Fifteen days after turning vegan, she tried cheese and she couldn’t stop feeling guilty about it",0
635,So then she started innovating recipes that would substitute dairy products,0

635,She confesses that she doesn’t miss dairy at all since she has found alternatives for every food items,0
635,"Her favourite is the vegan chocolate ice-cream which she makes it using cocoa powder, dates and tender coconut instead of coconut milk for chocolate like consistency",1
635,"“It has worked wonders,” she explains",0
635,"Marzipan, another favourite confectionery, primarily made with sugar is substituted with dates",0
635,"When it came to making cheese, she tried using agar-agar powder, a jelly like substance obtained from algae",0
635,"However, she did not want to use the ingredient so she thought hard as to what can substitute the product and have the same coagulating effect",0
635,"Three years ago, Mayavi was struck by the idea to try psyllium husk (also called Isagbol in India) and till date, her vegan cheese recipe is a hit",0
635,"Prior to becoming a nutri chef, Mayvi was a psychotherapist and also had a chocolate business",0
635,"Ever since her transformation to veganism, she had to sell off the chocolate business",1

636,"I believe they have a very delicate earthy flavour, which complements with any food you pair them with",0
636,"You will either love mushrooms or you will not, and if you do, you know that they work nearly with any spice or seasoning combination",0
636,They always taste different depending on its flavour profile and its processing,1
636,"There are different varieties of mushrooms depending on factors such as regions, sizes and flavours and each taste different",1
636,Regenerated mushrooms taste slightly stronger and better in flavours as compared to the fresh ones,1
636,"My preferred dish is Clay Pot Chicken with five spices, served with rice",1
636,Mushrooms complement the dish with its fantastic texture,0
636,My mantra of keeping the food simple allows me to use fresh ingredients which enhance the taste of the dish,1

639,"About 630,000 people die each year from heart disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",1
639,"While there is no singular cure for heart disease, there are numerous forms of treatment including lifestyle changes and surgical procedures",1
639,"In one procedure called a coronary angioplasty, a surgeon inserts and inflates a tiny balloon inside a blocked or narrow artery to widen it and allow blood to flow through to the heart thereby decreasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke",0
639,This procedure often includes inserting a permanent small mesh tube to support the blood vessel called a stent,0
639,Commercial stents can release chemotherapy agents that are toxic and can cause the blood vessel to narrow again,1
639,LSU Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences Professor Tammy Dugas is developing a new stent that releases red wine antioxidants slowly over time that promotes healing and prevents blood clotting and inflammation,0
639,The two antioxidant compounds are resveratrol and quercetin,0

646,NEW DELHI: The demand for organic foods began with fruits and vegetables when there were reports of pesticide residues in them,1
646,"However, the popularity of organic foods has now extended to food grains, pulses, tea, spices and even oilseeds",1
646,“Organic foods have gained popularity because people have become aware of their benefits,1
646,"They contain no chemical pesticides and fertilizers and are grown naturally with manure or compost and only natural pesticides and insecticides are used,” said Dr",0
646,"Saurabh Arora, MD (Auriga research and Director at Arbro Pharmaceuticals) and Founder of Food Safety Helpline",0
646,“Children are more susceptible than adults to diseases caused by chemical pesticide residues in food and so parents prefer to give them organic foods,0
646,Another advantage is that organic foods do not contain growth hormones or antibiotic residues,1
646,"Animals are often given growth hormones and antibiotics in animal feeds which are directly passed into animal foods like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products and from foods to the consumers",0
646,In organic farming these practices are banned and animals feed outside in natural surroundings,0
646,"Antibiotic containing foods consumed frequently makes these antibiotics ineffective in humans,” he added",0
646,"Organic food products are either grown under a natural system of agriculture, without the use of synthetic fertilizers or they are processed products made from organically produced raw materials",0
646,"“Therefore, any food offered for sale as 'organic food' in India, needs to comply with the provisions laid down under either the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) administered by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) or the Participatory Guarantee System for India (PGS-India) operated by the ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare",0
646,"There are a number of organic brands that use the term ‘organic” on labels but if these products are not certified then their authenticity is suspect,” said Arora",0
646,According to the Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) such foods that are labelled organic but not certified cannot be considered safe,0
646,The ICRIER also mentioned the need for a uniform standard for organic foods in its last report,1
646,"Now, the Food Safety Standards and Authority of India (FSSAI) has launched the Food Safety and Standards (Organic Foods) Regulations 2017 along with the unified logo for organic food products, supported with the tagline “Jaivik Bharat",0
646,"”

All organic foods certified under this logo also need to convey the full and accurate information on labels about the organic status of the food",0
646,The ‘Jaivik Bharat’ logo will henceforth be recognised as a mark of the quality assurance given by the above-mentioned certification bodies in India or any other bodies recognised by FSSAI,0
647,"BOSTON: Climate change may cause popular wines to taste different, forcing winemakers to plant lesser- known grape varieties to counteract some of the effects of global warming",1
647,"Scientists and vintners need to better understand the wide diversity of grapes and their adaptions to different climates, according to Elizabeth Wolkovich, assistant professor at Harvard University in the US",0
647,"""It's going to be very hard for many regions to continue growing the exact varieties they've grown in the past,"" Wolkovich said",0
647,"""The Old World has a huge diversity of winegrapes - there are over planted 1,000 varieties - and some of them are better adapted to hotter climates and have higher drought tolerance than the 12 varieties now making up over 80 per cent of the wine market in many countries,"" she said",0
647,"""We should be studying and exploring these varieties to prepare for climate change,"" she added",1
647,"Convincing wine producers to try different grape varieties is difficult at best, and the reason often comes down to the current concept of terroir - the notion that a wine's flavour is a reflection of where, which and how the grapes were grown",0
647,"As currently understood, only certain traditional or existing varieties are part of each terroir, leaving little room for change",0
647,"Even if winemakers were open to switching to new varieties, researchers do not have enough data to say whether other varieties would be able to adapt to climate change",1
647,"""Right now we know we have this diversity, but we have little information on how to use it,"" said Ignacio Morales- Castilla, from Harvard University",0
647,"""One of our other suggestions is for growers to start setting aside parts of vineyards to grow some other varieties to see which ones are working,"" said Castilla, who investigates which winegrape varieties will adequately mature where under climate change",0
647,"Even if researchers came to the table armed with information about grape diversity, Wolkovich said the industry still faces hurdles when it comes to making changes",1
647,"In Europe, growers have more than 1,000 grape varieties to choose from, research repositories such as INRA's Domaine de Vassal that study this diversity, and expertise in how to grow different varieties",0
647,Yet strict labelling laws have created restrictions on their ability to take advantage of this diversity,0
647,"For example, just three varieties of grapes can be labelled as Champagne or four for Burgundy",0
647,Similar restrictions have been enacted in many European regions - all of which force growers to focus on a small handful of grape varieties,0
647,"""The more you are locked into what you have to grow, the less room you have to adapt to climate change,"" Wolkovich said",1

648,"The cacao tree -- which produces cocoa beans -- can only grow within a narrow strip of rain forested land roughly 20 degrees north and south of the Equator, where temperature, rain, and humidity all stay relatively constant throughout the year",0
648,"However, the fragile plant is under threat from diseases and a changing climate that will suck moisture from the soil and make it impossible to produce a good crop in many regions around the world by 2050, the Sun reported",0
648,"According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, by 2050 the rising temperatures will push the chocolate-growing regions of the world more than 1,000 feet uphill into mountainous terrain -- much of which is currently preserved for wildlife",0
648,"The problem is most cocoa is produced by poor families who cannot afford fertilisers and pesticides, the experts noted",1
648,"""More than 90 per cent of the global cocoa crop is produced by smallholders on subsistence farms with unimproved planting material,"" Doug Hawkins, of Hardman Agribusiness -- a London based capital markets advisory services firm -- was quoted as saying to the Sun",1

651,"WASHINGTON: Tea lovers rejoice! New research shows drinking a cup of hot tea at least once a day can lower the risk of developing glaucoma, a serious eye condition",0
651,"But drinking decaffeinated and caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated tea, iced tea and soft drinks doesn't seem to make any difference to glaucoma risk, the findings show",1
651,"Glaucoma causes fluid pressure to build up inside the eye (intraocular pressure), damaging the optic nerve",0
651,"It is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, and currently affects 57",0
651,"5 million people, and is expected to increase to 65",0
651,5 million by 2020,0
651,"Previous research suggests that caffeine can alter intraocular pressure, but no study so far has compared the potential impact of decaffeinated and caffeinated drinks on glaucoma risk",0
651,So the researchers looked at data from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the US,0
651,"This is a nationally representative annual survey of around 10, 000 people that includes interviews, physical examinations, and blood samples, designed to gauge the health and nutritional status of US adults and children",0

651,"Nor did the survey ask about factors like cup size, tea type, or the length of brewing time, all of which might have been influential",0

652,"”

This is what led to the birth of Unlocked Café in 2017",0
652,"It was conceptualised with motifs of pawns and pieces adorning the walls, along with lounge style furniture ideal for relaxing and playing games",0
652,“I have built a library of about 100 board games for the cafe,1
652,"While waiting for their food to come, patrons can play games like Scrabble or Pictionary free-of-cost,” says Sanjali",0
652,"For serious board game enthusiasts, there are games like Quattro, Catan, Forbidden Island, Puerto Rico, Agricola, and A Game of Thrones—these are charged by the hour",0

652,"“Since the water and weather is different in Ahmedabad as opposed to New York, I had to develop the recipe for making the dough and use imported bread flour for these pizzas,” he says",0
652,"At first, selling this pizza in Ahmedabad was a challenge for him as diners had not tried foldable pizzas and had pre-conceived notions of how a pizza should be",0
652,"“Also, I had to experiment with toppings, since just offering what New York’s pizzas had was not enough to appeal to the local palate",0
652,I introduced Indian toppings too,0

653,"According to Yale neuroscientist, Gordon Shepherd, drinking wine stimulates more grey matter in the brain than solving math equations, reports the Independent",1
653,"In his book, ‘Neuroenology: How the Brain Creates the Taste of Wine’, Shepherd said that the process of drinking and interpreting wine is a complex and nuanced one",1
653,"This includes the way in which you sip the wine, how your tongue moves the wine around in your mouth, how your nose responds to the aroma of wine and so on",1
653,"While talking about his book, Shepherd shared, “You don’t just put wine in your mouth and leave it there",1
653,"You move it about and then swallow it, which is a very complex motor act",0
653,"”

The brain plays a very important role in deciphering the taste of wine",0
653,Shepherd likened it to the way our eyes perceive colours,0
653,“The analogy one can use is colour,0
653,"The objects we see don’t have colour themselves - light hits them and bounces off,” noted Shephard",0
653,"He further said, “It’s when light strikes our eyes that it activates systems in the brain that create colour from those different wavelengths",0
653,"Similarly, the molecules in wine don’t have taste or flavour, but when they stimulate our brain, the brain creates flavour the same way it creates colour",1

655,"Sure honey isn’t quite the vitamin and mineral source (or fat, fibre and protein source) that many marketing claims make it out to be but it is rich in certain plant-origin bio-active compounds, which are good for us",0
655,"It is also rich in antioxidants, an idea that is the single most important revenue-churner for the ‘reverse ageing’ cosmetic industry",1
655,"But more than just reducing wrinkles, antioxidants can reduce chances of heart-related issues, and can even be anti-carcinogenic",0
655,It lowers LDL and blood pressure—two things that are good to sustain a healthy heart,0
655,"Clearly, the extra calories that honey brings to the mix are easily offset by the benefits it provides",0
655,"So how does one choose a good brand?

Well, organic certification is always a good measure but it is an expensive one",0
655,So many producers may prefer to save the change and invest it in ensuring healthier beehives,0
655,"One way to do this is the same way as McDonald’s does it, choosing the right location",1
655,"The higher one goes in altitude, the more verdant and nature-rich the surroundings become, which allow bees’ access to better raw material",0
655,So you can have honey from all sorts of flowers to fruits like the Indian blackberry or even mustard,0
655,Purity is a concern but don’t bother doing the burn test or the ‘does it hold shape when poured into water’ one,0
655,Most honey brands will ensure compliance there,1
655,Bees can make honey even in crowded cities but the quality isn’t great,0
655,"Maintaining hives in high altitude farms is costly so when you see honey priced differently, apart from the pretty packaging, you may be paying for the difficult sourcing costs being incurred by the maker",0
655,Sadly I don’t know much about reliable brands out there,0
655,Beechworth honey from Victoria in Australia remains a high reference point for me and every honey I try is compared against them,0
655,"Locally, Societe Naturelle is made by a very health-conscious marathoner friend, who supplied me with some versions",0
655,It was much richer than any of the big brands out there,0

655,Smaller producers stand a better chance of cornering this market,0

656,"I am in Rudesheim am Rhein, a small town in the scenic area of Rhinegau, a small strip of land bordering the Rhine, in Germany, surrounded by vineyards on terraced slopes",0
656,"Long ago, Rudesheim was a wealthy vineyard town, and made its money from wine-making and shipping",0
656,"Soon after the town, there is a bend in the Rhine river, so Rudesheim became a popular spot to change boats, unload goods, and rest the horses",0
656,"“Today the population of the town is only around 10,000 but we have 1",0
656,"5 million tourists per year,” says guide Sebastian Eickenbusch",0
656,Most of the visitors are those who land here on a river cruise down the Rhine,0
656,"The south-facing slopes surrounding the town get many hours of sunshine, and this is home to the finest Riesling wines",1
656,Wine-making has been a tradition here since Roman times and today most vineyards are family-owned,0
656,Every summer the town has a wine festival when a wine queen and her princesses are crowned to represent the town,1
656,"The centre of all action in town is the narrow cobbled street called Drosselgasse, lined with wine and beer taverns, souvenir shops and open-air restaurants that buzz with revelry throughout the day",0
656,"“Long ago it was the path used by boat owners to move goods to their homes,” explains Eickenbusch",0
656,"As evening progresses, groups of people sitting on terraces start singing and dancing to music by brass bands, and singers belting old classics",0

My home away from home is the Hotel Linderwirt, where I have a lovely room overlooking the terrace and the busy Drosselgasse",0
656,"If you are adventurous, you can even choose one of its six special rooms, made from converted wine barrels",0
656,"Eickenbusch recommends we do the Ring Tour that takes you in a circuit through the vineyards, to the towering Germania monument, then to the red wine town of Assmannhausen and finally a boat ride on the Rhine, back to the town",0
656,"Taking the cable car, we get a unique view as we float over the geometric rows of the vineyards reaching the top of a hill, with panoramic views over the Rhine Valley",0
656,"We walk to the gargantuan Germania monument—a German ‘Statue of Liberty’ with a woman holding a crown and a sword—which was erected in 1871, after Germany became a unified state for the first time",0
656,"We continue from the monument, doing a three-kilometre trek through a thick beech and oak forest",0
656,"This is located in a national reserve which was developed by Count Ostein, in the late 1800s",0
656,"On the way back we take the chair lift to the village of Assmanshausen, which is the only area that grows red wine in these parts",0
656,"It’s a tranquil downhill ride passing through the homes of locals, sliding over their terraces and peering into their living rooms, down to the town",0
656,"We walk to the pier and take a boat back to Rudesheim, enjoying the views over the Rhine",1

657,"Manu Chandra

On a rapid, pan-India eatery expansion spree, the creative heart behind the trio of superb restaurants—The Fatty Bao, Toast & Tonic and Monkey Bar—Chef Chandra means serious business as he spins out winsome specials from this kitchen in his signature, mince-no-words style",0
657,"So with three bustling chains of smashing restobars, is Chandra cracking it cool? “Well, we are making money",0
657,"But honestly, I do not think I have nailed it per se",0
657,"In my mind, I have tried to offer the best cuisine at the best price",0
657,"As chef partner at these restaurants, it is viable for me to serve up great food at nominal prices, without pricing myself out of the market,” he says",0
657,"Fair enough, but the triad seems to have got the dynamics right: from the edgy decor to noveau small plates to sassed-up, boozy cocktails",0
657,"Monkey Bar hits bull’s-eye with the spender shell-out of `700-900 per person, Toast & Tonic with `1,500 per person, with Fatty at around `800 per person",1
657,“I always feel price is an instrument of economy,0
657,It is tough to run a restaurant without a sizeable quantum flowing in,0
657,"Everything needs to be taken into account, including the rent and salaries",0
657,"The plan is to achieve high revenue during the first year, then break even",0
657,"”

About the new bowl menu, he says, “Bowl meals are my all-time favourite",0
657,"The one bowl meal finds inspiration from Asian cuisines as the bowl is perfectly suited for dishes like ramens, soups and noodles",0
657,"”

It ain’t been all easy",0
657,"With the recently opened Delhi Fatty initially whimpering at the outset, Chandra swung into action with the born effrontery of a seasoned gambler",0
657,"“As the team leader, I take ownership but the redressal has to be a united and strong effort,” he says",1
657,"Salmon Lollipop

Is he big on drawing in local produce? “I have been pushing for fresh, local produce since I started out",0
657,"Quite challenging, with Insta food narratives dominating the foodscape",0
657,It isn’t a trend,0
657,It is logical,0
657,"Millets, with their age-old goodness, needed to come back on the plate, to give back to the farmer,” he points out",0
657,“My only parameter is goodness,0
657,"So while I source ingredients locally as much as I can, for instance in Mumbai, I get my fish from Kochi as the varieties in Mumbai simply do not measure up in taste",0
657,"”

Despite being a highly sought -after chef for 14 years, Chandra is averse to posturing on social media",0
657,"“I simply loathe the vanity investment,” he says",0
657,"So while he isn’t really the Twitter king, the economy of tweets appeals to him as he airs his opinions",1
657,"“I am a chef, fine, but I can have an opinion on political issues as well",0
657,I needn’t upload pictures of my personal life and my creations,0

Chandra does his own gardening, washing and cooking",0
657,So what’s next? “I don’t have a manifesto,0
657,"No book, no roles as a judge on the telly (blame his acrid honesty)",0
657,I never want to compartmentalise myself professionally,0
657,"I’d rather do my own thing, like write a novel",0
657,I am fascinated by India,0
657,I want to give back,1
657,” Chandra has a simple anthem for survival: “Learn to depend on your own self,1
657,Don’t depend on others,0
657,"Be hands-on, and work on your shortcomings",0
657,”,0
658,"There are some distinct ingredients that add a unique taste to our cooking, and our favourite dishes become less interesting without them",0
658,"Drumsticks or moringa (long slender, triangular seed-pods) have great importance in many south Indian delicacies such as sambar, rasam, avial etc",0
658,"Unlike today, moringa was a lesser known vegetable to north Indian people but in the south we had a tree in every kitchen garden as it was ideal soil to grow a moringa plant",0
658,"Once the plant grows to a usual height of 6/7 metres, you have regular yield for domestic use and sometimes more to give away",0
658,"Kids were taught how to eat these hard-looking, long pieces of drumsticks in our curries: “Gently split them open and separate the creamy flesh with your teeth and enjoy the pleasant flavour”",0
658,"Along with popularity of south Indian food away from home, like other ingredients, drumsticks too travelled far and wide, yet people wouldn’t like this vegetable until they learn to eat the soft flesh inside and discard the fibrous exterior",0
658,"Occasionally, people even misunderstand it for okra and chew drumstick for long time and make funny remarks like “dish was very tasty but that okra was under-cooked!”

Later, as healthy eating became a focal point for many, especially in the last decade or so, people discovered other uses of moringa tree",0
658,Its leaves are used in daily diet due to its highly nutritious qualities  people are getting used to its slightly sharper taste,0
658,Until recently we didn’t know about delicious warm salads made of moringa flowers and they taste amazing too  you can feel lightness as you complete a meal with them,0
658,"All these dishes were already part of a village meal, especially agro families",0
658,That was only half the story of illustrious moringa family and its use in our food and medicines,0
658,Meeting Nanalal Satra in Bengaluru was a pleasant surprise as he started talking about his successful export of moringa oil to Germany,1
658,"Unfortunately, many of us wouldn’t have even heard of this oil, which has a variety of usage and a tremendous demand in Europe",0
658,Purabi Sarkar has done research on moringa oil and travels around spreading benefits of this special oil and we were lucky enough to listen to one of her lectures,1
658,Purabi talked about moringa oil’s rich vitamin and unsaturated fatty acid qualities,0
658,It is also used to increase health and strength of hair and scalp,0
658,Moringa oil is extracted by pressing the seeds of Moringa oleifera,1
658,"Countries such as India and Sri Lanka, and Africa produce the best variety, also called Ben oil, which has high amounts of behenic acid",0
658,There are so many good qualities and reasons to show the superior demand for moringa oil,0
658,"No wonder, it was mentioned as a very useful oil in Ayurveda, and the medicinal books of Greece and Rome",0
658,"The oil contains antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, which help in curing cuts, bruises, burns, insect bites and rashes",0
658,"It’s also supposed to be a nice cooking oil owing to its soft, appealing taste, though it’s more expensive than the many others available and subject to availability",0
658,"Ayurveda doctor Sanand suggests, “Moringa oil is good for people with sleeping disorders, prevents ageing and contains aphrodisiac elements",1
658,"”

Time and again, it is revealed that simple, wholesome foods like moringa provide incredible balance to our health and happiness",0
658,"As Purabi insists, “We need to educate people and develop these nature’s remedies for everyday living, with increased demand",0
658,It will enhance interest for large-scale production of moringa oil,1
658,We have the best quality moringa in our region and ideal weather conditions to cultivate it,0
658,” The author runs the London-based Rasa chain of restaurants,0
659,Every family has some special recipes that they cherish,0
659,"These are the dishes full of stories that bring back the feeling of warmth, comfort and simplicity every time they are made",0
659,"While for many of us they just remain the delicacies cooked by mothers or grandmothers and are lost with the changing times, some make a point to carry forward the family legacy",0
659,"Here we speak to some chefs, who have either recreated the heritage recipes or dishes of their childhood",0
659,Some are presenting these in their menus in a new avatar making a personalised statement while others are re-producing them as authentic as they can be for food lovers’ delight,0
659,"Culinary journey of Balaji Natarajan, Executive Sous Chef, Park Hyatt, Chennai, is loaded with childhood memories of his grandma’s food",1
659,"So, he has dedicated some dishes to his family and traditions",0
659,Balaji takes pride in introducing his native region and its traditional cuisine,0
659,“I am a ‘Kongu Tamilian’ belonging to a region called Kongunadu in Tamil Nadu,0
659,"This cuisine is a collection of recipes from more than 50 cities in Tamil Nadu, unlike Chettinad cuisine—food of only one city of Tamil Nadu called Karaikudi,” he says",0
659,“Kongunadu cuisine does not involve marination of any raw material,0
659,Addition of roasted groundnut paste to curries and Khormas creates a very different flavour,0
659,"”

As a child, Balaji spent all his time in the joint family set-up in Sathyamangalam",0
659,"From that memory, he shares one of his family’s recipe of Kambu Paniyaram",0
659,"“Kambu means pearl millet, Paniyaram means a dumpling,” he says",0
659,“Kambu Paniyaram can be enjoyed any time of the day,0
659,"”

He says his grandma used traditional stone grinder called ‘Attangal’ to grind the millet batter",0
659,‘Aruvamanai’ is traditional equipment used in villages for grating coconuts and for cutting vegetables,0
659,Kuzhipaniyaram Karai is a traditional cast iron pan with mould used to make Paniyaram dumplings,1
659,"Balaji says, “Kongunadu cuisine is neither very spicy nor oily and healthy to eat",0
659,"”

A dish that makes Chef Ajay Anand, Director of Culinary, Pullman and Novotel New Delhi Aerocity, emotional is Lahore ki Pinni from the house of Madan Lal Halwai in Sadar Bazar of Old Delhi",0
659,“I remember my early childhood years when my grandfather would take me to this shop,0
659,"The shop was set up on the auspicious occasion of Lohri in 1948, after the family migrated to Delhi from Lahore",0
659,Lahore ki Pinni has been on their menu since the first Republic Day in 1950 and no Delhi winter of mine was complete without biting into the delightful Madan Pinni,0
659,The sense of joy I get after biting into something so simple yet so memorable is awesome,0
659,"”

Going back to their roots, celebrated chefs are digging into history and making utmost efforts to preserve our rich culinary traditions",0
659,"Chef Arun Sundararaj, Executive Chef, The Taj Mahal Hotel, New Delhi, says, “At Varq, we constantly endeavour to offer unique and meaningful experiences by frequently curating special menus inspired by flavours from different corners of the country",0
659,"For example, we crafted a special menu ‘Lost Recipes of the Royals’ which brought forth forgotten recipes from the royal kitchens of four erstwhile kingdoms of India—Kashmiri Dogras, the kings of Travancore, the Nizams of Hyderabad and the Mewars of Rajasthan",0
659,"The menu featured regal dishes like Pattode ke kebab, Tujji chicken, Paneer gulnar kebab, Nizami saada aash, Cheera ada curry, Noori Hyderabadi biryani and desserts like garlic kheer with broken wheat porridge",0
659,We familiarised ourselves with the various cooking techniques used in these kitchens,0
659,"For Saada Aash, the Nizami lamb soup is simmered for seven hours and tempered seven times before it is served",0
659,"Khichdi Rafat is the Nizami royals’ twist to the humble khichdi cooked with tender pieces of chicken, duck, lamb, almonds and aromatic spices",0
659,"”

Talking about his favourite recipe, Arun says, “Duet of Paasley Angeera and Murgh Hawa Mahal is my favourite",0
659,"Inspired by the kings of Mewar, the dish is our take on the signature Rajasthani lamb chop and cooked the traditional way on charcoal",0
659,"”

Desi Citiwala Kukkad is one dish that steals the show in the genre of heritage recipes at Hotel Fairmont, Jaipur",0
659,"Executive Chef Manpreet Singh Mallik says, “The dish is inspired by and dedicated to all the home cooks, mothers, dhabas and the real rustic cuisine of India",0
659,While conversing with the guests we realised that they often want to taste the traditional foods,0
659,"”

He adds: “So we selected chicken-based dish",0
659,We have tied up with a local farmer from a nearby village to source our desi murga,0
659,"The masalas are hand-ground in a mortar and pestle (imam dasta), and then carefully cooked in pressure cooker",0
659,"This dish is cooked on the bone, which ensures all the flavour remains in the curry",0
659,"We serve it in a tiny pressure cooker, while it is still hot",0
659,"”

660,"PANAJI: Wondering whether a Chardonnay pairs well with fish, or a nice juicy steak would work nicely with a Cabernet Sauvignon? In a few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would address these dilemmas for you, playing its part as a virtual sommelier, according to Robert Joseph, a wine expert, wine producer and author of an upcoming book on the future of wines",0
660,"UK-based Joseph, who has authored 25 books, including ""The Complete Encyclopedia of Wine"", has keenly watched developments in India's nascent wine industry and says that Kashmir, with its climate and abundance of water, could be ideal for developing vineyards",0
660,"Over the next few decades, the wine ecosystem would undergo a sea change, right from the manner in which consumers buy wine to involvement of machines in the production process and AI coming to the aid of wine buyers and enthusiasts when it comes to choosing the right vino",0
660,"""AI will revolutionise wine-buying",0
660,"I am going to tell my digital assistant, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri that I want to buy a bottle of red wine and it will say to me, 'Do you want to have the one you had last time?' It knows you so well, what you like and what your friends like",0
660,"And what AI doesn't know today, it will learn, very fast,"" Joseph told IANS on the sidelines of 'Sula Selections: Globe in a Glass Roadshow 2017' event here",0
660,"And of course, technology will determine the growth of the industry, right from the vineyards to sales",1
660,"""Self-drive cars mean we will not have to worry about drinking and driving, spurring consumption",0
660,Labour is a big problem in the US and Europe,0
660,It will be possible to automate a vineyard completely within 5 to10 years,0
660,Robots will do the whole thing,0
660,"Already we are getting drones to do the flying over the vineyards, which can tell you which vines need water or treating,"" said Joseph, who is a partner at le Grand Noir wines in France",0
660,"""Machines will do a lot of the judging (wine tasting)",0
660,"They can judge between an OK wine and a not-so-Ok wine pretty effectively,"" he said, adding that there would still be scope for human discernment",0
660,"But wine critics, he said, would be more and more redundant with peer reviews replacing the formal art of wine criticism",1
660,"""We are going to see different kinds of wines, like fruit-flavoured wines; you will see a lot more wine cocktails",0

660,There's no God who defined the size,0
660,"We are going to see wines in single serves and big bottles,"" he said",0

1) Sweet - Very picky about their wines",0

665,"WASHINGTON: Your favourite pizza topping could you help fight aging!

A team of Penn State researchers found mushrooms are rich in antioxidants that scientists say could be used fight aging and boost general health",0
665,"The study suggests that mushrooms have high amounts of the ergothioneine and glutathione, both important antioxidants, said Professor Robert Beelman",1
665,He added that the researchers also found that the amounts the two compounds varied greatly between mushroom species,1
665,"""What we found is that, without a doubt, mushrooms are highest dietary source of these two antioxidants taken together, and that some types are really packed with both of them,"" said Beelman",0
665,"Beelman said that when the body uses food to produce energy, it also causes oxidative stress because some free radicals are produced",0
665,"Free radicals are oxygen atoms with unpaired electrons that cause damage to cells, proteins and even DNA as these highly reactive atoms travel through the body seeking to pair up with other electrons",0
665,"Replenishing antioxidants in the body, then, may help protect against this oxidative stress",0
665,"""There's a theory -- the free radical theory of aging -- that's been around for a long time that says when we oxidize our food to produce energy there's a number of free radicals that are produced that are side products of that action and many of these are quite toxic,"" said Beelman",0
665,"""The body has mechanisms to control most of them, including ergothioneine and glutathione, but eventually enough accrue to cause damage, which has been associated with many of the diseases of aging, like cancer, coronary heart disease and Alzheimer's",0
665,"""

According to the researchers, the amounts of ergothioneine and glutathione in mushrooms vary by species with the porcini species, a wild variety, containing the highest amount of the two compounds among the 13 species tested",0
665,"""We found that the porcini has the highest, by far, of any we tested,"" said Beelman",0
665,"""This species is really popular in Italy where searching for it has become a national pastime",0
665,"""

The more common mushroom types, like the white button, had less of the antioxidants, but had higher amounts than most other foods, Beelman said",0
665,"The amount of ergothioneine and glutathione also appear to be correlated in mushrooms, the researchers said",1
665,"Mushrooms that are high in glutathione are also high in ergothioneine, for example",1
665,"Cooking mushrooms does not seem to significantly affect the compounds, Beelman said",0
665,"""Ergothioneine are very heat stable,"" said Beelman",0
665,"Beelman said that future research may look at any role that ergothioneine and glutathione have in decreasing the likelihood of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease",0
665,"""It's preliminary, but you can see that countries that have more ergothioneine in their diets, countries like France and Italy, also have lower incidences of neurodegenerative diseases, while people in countries like the United States, which has low amounts of ergothioneine in the diet, have a higher probability of diseases like Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's,"" said Beelman",0
665,"""Now, whether that's just a correlation or causative, we don't know",0
665,"But, it's something to look into, especially because the difference between the countries with low rates of neurodegenerative diseases is about three milligrams per day, which is about five button mushrooms each day",0

668,"If we are right, it adds to a small but growing set of examples that humans had big effects on ecosystems prior to the onset of organised agriculture,"" he said",0
668,"For the study, appearing in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, the team compared the sequenced genomes of wild and domesticated Eurasian grapes",0
668,"The scientists found that populations of the fruit steadily decreased until the period of domestication, when grapes began to be grown and harvested for wine",1
668,"The long decline could reflect unknown natural processes, or it may mean that humans began managing natural populations long before they were actually domesticated, the researchers said",1
668,The altering of several important genes -- involved in sex determination and others related primarily to the production of sugar -- during domestication was a key turning point for the fruit,0
668,"These changes helped define grapes and probably contributed to the spreading of the crop throughout the ancient world, Gaut noted",0

676,"The skull is an intriguing entry point, and it manages to underpin the entire narrative of Kim A Wagner’s new book The Skull of Alum Bheg: The Life and Death of Rebel of 1857",1
676,"From this grisly starting point, Wagner narrates how, in the summer heat of mid-1857, native Bengal Army units at Sialkot mutinied, killing officers and civilians and looting the cantonment, and then set out for Delhi to join Bahadur Shah, the briefly-minted ‘Emperor of India’",0
676,They didn’t make it,0
676,John Nicholson intercepted them with a British force as they tried to cross the Ravi river,0
676,"Three days later, Nicholson annihilated the 1,100 trapped sepoys in the Battle of Trimmu Ghat",0
676,"All but wiped out by ‘Nikal Seyn’ Nicholson’s moving column, the survivors fled into the Himalayas",0
676,A year later they were dragged back to Sialkot and blown up from the mouth of a cannon  Havildar Alum Bheg among them,1
676,"His head was picked up, ‘defleshed’, and brought home to Dublin by a captain of the 7th Dragoon Guards—the ultimate proof—as Wagner deems it, ‘of colonial power’",0
676,"In 1963, the skull was discovered in a store room of The Lord Clyde pub",0
676,"The owners of the pub learnt from a note left in an eye socket that it belonged to Alum Bheg, who played a leading role in the mutiny in Sialkot",0
676,"Wagner received an email in 2014 from the owners, and the story begins",0
676,But this book is not only about Alum Bheg,0
676,It is also about the experience of ordinary people from different parts of the world whose lives were drastically changed or cut short by the events of 1857 and soon after,0
676,It is more of a reconstruction of history rather than a biography of Alum Bheg,0
676,And Wagner makes it believable  his depiction of life and death on the ground is helped by the depth of research and thickly footnoted academic rigor as it is by his evident passion for history and flair for language,0
676,It is a collective study of Indian sepoys and their common characteristics and their role in the events of 1857,0
676,Wagner is careful to portray the personalities on all sides of the conflict and this makes his account all the more convincing,0
676,"Although we know the final brutal outcome, we are drawn into the relationships and circumstances as if we were reading a fictional thriller",0
676,"There are no heroes in this book, only victims",0
676,"The book brings together the story of thousands of Indian soldiers in British service whose names have been lost to history and whose existence was recorded only as a number when they deserted, were executed, or killed on the battlefield",0
676,The violence that produced Alum Bheg’s skull and its collection as a war trophy too finds continuing mention through the book,1
676,The brutality of British repression is not glossed over either,0
676,"It never could be explained away in the decades after 1857; neither could the skull, and so it was hidden",1
676,Wagner’s book is an exception to such history that has almost always been told from the British point of view,1
676,"A lecturer in British imperial history at Queen Mary College in London, he however still seems to be on the fence with regards to the nomenclature: is it a mutiny, a rebellion or the first war of independence",0
676,"Nevertheless, as he notes in the introduction, his book is unlikely to appeal to many as neither does it indulge in Raj nostalgia nor does it subscribe to Indian nationalist mythology",0
676,"In all, it is a valiant effort by Wagner and must be recognised as such",0
676,"In itself, it makes for a compelling read and is likely to become a key resource for students of Indian colonial history",0
677,"Hilarious and timely, this four-colour illustrated book from The Onion satirises the Trump administration, based on the “Trump Leaks”—hundreds of memos, e-mails, letters “leaked” from the White House—with 30 pages of additional new material",1
677,"“Just wanted to let you know about a recent transgression of mine we might need to get out ahead of,” Vice-President Mike Pence alerts Chief-of-Staff Reince Preibus in one of the leaked administration e-mails that The Onion got hold of",1
677,"“On Monday, Mrs Pence and I went to Bloomingdales, and when she was off on her own I accidentally wandered through the juniors department, specifically the little girls section… I was only there for 30 seconds, and I don’t think anybody saw me, but I think we should have Spicer prepare a response…” This is among hundreds of deliciously funny “leaks” collected in The Trump Leaks",1

678,"Speaking after the launch of 'Hariye Jawa Lekha', (Collection of Lost Writings), the 82-year old Ananda Purashkar recipient said, ""This is a big problem and the writers are losing interest",1

678,"Even there had been effort by Sheikh Hasina government, but that too yielded little effect,"" Mukhopadhyay told reporters on the sidelines of the book launch, here yesterday",0
678,"He said there should be an end to such practice, or else the writers will lose interest",0
678,Mukhopadhyay said the craze over Bengali writers and their volume of works was much more evident in Bangladesh than in West Bengal,1
678,Several books of the writer had been made into films,0
678,"Asked about the rallies announced by some intellectuals in protest against recent communal clashes in Bengal, Mukhopadhyay said, ""Only a handful of miscreants instigate riots",0

679,I told myself that she would eventually ask me questions that I couldn't answer and that completely unravelled me,1
679,"I made a firm commitment to myself -- and to her -- that I would make a valiant effort to find us a comfortable spiritual home,"" Kumar writes in the Introduction",0
679,"Narrated from the open-minded perspective of a spiritual seeker rather than a religious scholar, the book offers an honest account of some of the less-than-mainstream spiritual practices that are followed by millions of people in the world today as she searched for answers to life's most universal questions",0
679,"Kumar, a part of a rapidly growing population in America that is highly spiritual but religiously uncommitted, was convinced that traditional religions were not a fit for her",0
679,She was also aware that she couldn't simply Google these answers,0
679,"She set out on a spiritual pilgrimage, looking for answers",0
679,"During the quest, she headed to the mountains of Peru to learn from the shamans, attended the techie haunt of Burning Man, practised transcendental meditation, communed with angels and visited saints, goddesses, witches and faith healers",0

680,Outside the building his sightless eyes follow the gaze of a mango tree that is almost always a grim association with his father’s suicide,0
680,"During their brief years of togetherness, Deepti remained a luminous presence in his life mellowing down the memory of his father’s suicide",0
680,"With the light gone, Prakash turns blind in both the eyes and is once again obsessed by the thought of his father’s death",1
680,"“When he became certain that the reason behind Deepti’s disappearance would remain an unfathomable mystery, he found himself seriously pondering about the cause behind his own father’s vanishing act",1
680,He felt sure of a discernible connection in the inexplicable circumstances behind the sudden departure of the two people who had given meaning to his life,0
680,"”

A chance encounter with a letter in his father’s library puts him in touch with Abha Ma, a colleague and friend of his father, and he begins a correspondence with her",0
680,"Along with the unrelenting quest for his lost wife, he also becomes close to Rajani, a woman with a tormented past",0
680,A passionate affair follows but Rajani can sense that she cannot have it all—the “luminescence” of Deepti being a lingering presence,0
680,"Shyam, his childhood friend, is a witness to it all and accompanies Prakash everywhere—in search of Deepti and his visits to Rajani",0
680,"With these two characters, Meera’s narrative exhibits a complex but a clever interplay of light and darkness",1
680,"While Prakash steps into the world of sightlessness, Shyam is the eyes through which he trudges the real world",0
680,"Yet, Shyam is also the shadow just as Prakash functions through his mind’s eyes—when attempting to identify Deepti at the shelter or picking out books for patrons at the library he works",0
680,Abha Ma’s last letter helps put the ghost of his father’s death behind him,0
680,What about Deepti’s mystery? What of the two women? The one he cannot find and the one he cannot have? The one who has disappeared and the one who left disillusioned,0
680,"Elsewhere, the two (women) have had a brief interlude or so the author might like us to believe",0

681,She investigates who she really is and where she came from,0
681,"While providing a counterpoint, trite domestic passages sit at odds with the wide sweep of the narrative",0
681,The actual language is simple enough to seem flippant bordering on dull,0
681,"However, the author manages to create a well-structured tale set in a time we need to know about",0
681,The research is thorough and the style of writing brings characters and the backdrop alive,0
681,"As a translation from German, it is remarkably lucid and meaningful",0
681,"In a bid to escape their fates, Paul and Clara convert to Christianity",0
681,It amounts to nothing as they are only known for their non-Aryan heritage and treated Jews are,0
681,Lillian is brought up as a Catholic,0
681,This unique situation of crossing the boundaries of religious identity is the stronger story and has been dealt with only in passing,1
681,To those interested in Nazi era Germany this is a must read,0
682,"While reading a work of non-fiction, issues that matter are not just the author’s thought process, perspective and ability to look at facts dispassionately but also their body of work as one entity",0
682,The first introduction of Mehr Tarar to Indian readers is as a woman who was mocked and demonised in the media for her supposed involvement with a leading politician and the war of words that ensued between interested parties,0
682,It was not very tasteful,0
682,Subsequently Tarar was scorned on both sides of the border,0
682,"She was castigated loudly and dubiously by self-proclaimed upholders of tehzeeb and power in her country, Pakistan; to her credit she stood her ground",1
682,"Her narrative subtly but succinctly reflects the nuances of the events that came to pass, but that is not all",1
682,"The writer reveals in-depth understanding of the lives of both eminent and everyday people, especially women",0
682,"It examines the different aspects of Indo-Pak ties, and the problems and possible solutions without offering judgment",0
682,The book holds detailed mentions of her homeland turning into the nurturing ground of newly-fundamentalist religion and how it affects lives across borders,0
682,She agonises over the trauma of misogyny in her country where female independence is ostracised and women are categorised according to chauvinistic views,0
682,But Tarar is Pakistani,0
682,She is in love with her country,0
682,She also has opinions on politics in our country,0
682,She is an assertive woman and she is political,0
682,"These do not bode well for a women in the male dominated society in Pakistan, which is always ready with unwelcome and unsought retribution",0
682,"However, Tarar takes apart the wall of prejudice brick by brick with her lucid understanding of life, gender, and politics in her country",1
682,She is an unabashed patriot,0
682,"But above all, she addresses humanity within her nation’s context, moving the reader with the complexity of belief",0
682,"Do We Not Bleed is a portmanteau of stories within a story, that houses a holistic national sentiment",0
682,"It is through this perspective that I read the book; a sight I had gained, too, by a present on-the-ground understanding of Pakistan and expansive professional work on the arts and socio-cultural issues on a national and global scale where the chaos of the country is as visible as the beauty of its past",0
682,Tarar’s book is a journey through the vast spectrum of layered history and the individual choices of the dramatis personae of her land’s tale,0
682,She addresses the contradiction of Jinnah’s love to create a country based on Islam— an ideal nation of peace and prosperity—and the hard facts of religion interfering with governance and the corruption in its politics and polity that has created many a catastrophe for the land of her birth,0
682,Her language is delicately detailed yet the words hit home hard,0
682,Tarar throws caution to the wind and redeems herself in unwilling eyes with the grace and aplomb of a master scribe who knows what she is talking of and does it with a compassionate understanding of life and people,0
682,The account of each individual’s life in the book is factual and lucidly descriptive,1
682,"From the vast treasury of bilateral angst, rebellion with a world view, Tarar’s book is a verbal whirlwind through the mindscape of the people, predilections and prospects of the sub-continent",1

683,The Bengaluru-based author was recently in the city for the launch of her book ‘The Cows of Bangalore’ by Prakriti Foundation,1
683,"After having spent most of her childhood in namma Chennai, Shoba went on to graduate from the Columbia Journalism School, where she was awarded with a Pulitzer Fellowship",1
683,"Having spent 20 years in the US, Shoba is now settled in Bengaluru with her family",0
683,"The award-winning author talks to us about her book, love for the city and culture",0
683,"“The beauty of cows is that you can expand it to look at anything in our country, so I was using that as an anchor to explore all that is happening and going on in India",0
683,"” The book starts with an anecdote about the time when she saw a cow in the elevator of her apartment, brought in for a house-warming ceremony",0
683,"Her Eureka moment for the book happened when she befriended Sarala, the lady who brought milk for her, and they shared a special relationship",0
683,“We all encounter so many people in our daily lives like the isthiri wala and the flower vendor,0
683,"But Sarala was unusual; she is very generous, a great story teller, she loves cows and moreover she was able to explain it in a way that somebody who is cynical can understand",0
683,Her personality is what gave rise to the book,1
683,” Shoba explains,1
683,"The book which is a simple narrative that happened organically over 10 years in Shoba’s life includes the story of how she went around villages in Karnataka with Sarala to buy her a new cow, with the money that she had given the latter on loan",0
683,"“One day she came up to me and said ‘Amma, can you give me a loan of `40,000, I want to buy a cow",0
683,"’ And being the good storyteller that she is, she convinced me to do the same",0
683,"We looked at around 30 cows before settling on Anandalakshmi,” she says",0
683,The book further looks into all the aspects of a cow and how it is an important part of the mythology and Indian culture,0
683,"“Anything with ‘go’ is linked to the cow (Godavari, Gotra, Gopal)",0
683,"We introduced ghee and the cow was the source of it, we used the same ghee to do agni homam and reach out to god",0
683,"Even in Vedic times, they would domesticate other animals like sheep, buffalo, horses, etc",0
683,So then why did they chose the cow of all those to be a sacred animal?” she asks,0
683,The only challenge Shoba faced was when she had to decide whether to include the political aspects of the topic,1
683,"“In India, the cow has become a political topic, so I had to make the choice if I should include it",1
683,"As a vegetarian who loves animals I decided that if I have to do this halfway political thing I would have to get into the butchering and slaughtering, which I did not have the stomach for,” she says",0
684,This is an interesting bouquet of poetry from the former editor-in-chief of DNA,0
684,His experiences in the literary world and life in general seem to have seeped through the recesses of his poetry,1
684,There is a glimmer of darkness where the world scampers for light,0
684,One agrees with Ranjit Hoskote’s inference in his forward which sees CP’s work as clearly not ‘entertain[ing] an unduly optimistic belief in the human animal’s belief to redeem itself from its failings’,0
684,"In fact it is this quality that makes his work unique and brings out the decadence of the masses in a world, which in lapses of moments, is sliding to nothingness",0
684,What is left out is daily life,0
684,What is captivated is the wisdom of trials,0
684,This quality runs through the entire stream of his poetry rightly justified by his writings in tribute to Vijay Nambisan at the beginning of the book,0
684,CP stands by the man’s integrity and a hope lost in the faith towards humanity uplifting itself by spirit in life when it is so base materially while dealing with men and women of creative and honest spirit,0
684,From this spring of the spewed raw truth rises the despair in CP’s verse,0
684,The works may describe everyday life yet are decadent and reveal subtleties of the dark recesses of human turmoil beautifully,0
684,There is a sense of nothingness as far as time is concerned and life moves on even with the worst turmoil,0
684,"The poems do not care to lend themselves to a poignant experience but are meant to show the facets, though sometimes ugly and sometimes devoid of life, in their entirety",0
684,Some of the verses are uncomfortable to read and they are meant to be so,0
684,There is no release or catharsis but a brilliance of the ultimate truth of life,1
684,Life goes on in his works in a sauntering sort of a gait,0
684,CP has also been careful not to show pity to the self in his works from memory and stayed away from a poignant attitude towards past events,0
684,"Though the beautiful textures of darkness are brought out gently and not as a force unleashed, one can see he is capable of the sensitive positive subtleties, though he seems vary of it",0
684,In some places within his verse he lapses into private moments that are incomprehensible and emerges again in shifts of expression of the lack of expectation of life and its events,0
684,It is only in the darkness of the truth revealed does one find rest and freedom in his work,1
684,One feels a holding back as far as the energy of the verse is concerned almost as if left unsaid with the will wanting,0
684,"The verses in ‘Contentment’, seem to distil the essence of this particular collection of poems in their revelation of life, discovery of the nether, dealing with it and moving on to a mundane regular living with a brilliance in even its lack of meaning",0
684,In that understanding does the poet gain his freedom,0
684,Let the truth of darkness be unfolded layer by layer in the escaping joys of the vision of positivity that life is a mirage of,1
684,If you are looking for poetry as a lyric of a romantic imaginative soul to utopia this book is not for you,0
684,"But if you have the courage to live life and face its beautiful, spellbinding greys then this might just be your call",0

There seems to be a feeling of loss and melancholy running through most of your works in this collection",0
684,"Well, I am not sure about the melancholy part of it, as it is a coinage that gained currency, I believe, with the Romantic period",0
684,I am no great Romantic,0
684,The sense of loss though is real,0
684,And I think it might have a lot to do with a certain aspect of my childhood,0

684,"From there to Available Light, which has a personal view of the world, how do you think your writing has evolved?

The terseness you mention stems mostly from an unrelenting pursuit of the past; a dig and search operation",0
684,Not that one succeeded in the mission,0
684,The current crop of poems is relatively an outward journey primarily because they seem to reconcile to the possibility that the world outside the self is just as f****d up as the self,0
684,"In this age of instant coffee and WhatsApp messages, have we stopped enjoying poetry?

I believe it is not so much as enjoying poetry as a fierce disrespect ingrained in the perception of it",0
684,Poetry as we perceive it in India can be anything so long as the lines are short,0
684,The general result is a secret scorn and contempt in the higher circles of the literati,0
684,"The bad name that poetry is stigmatised with is because of the proliferation of bad poets, an ill spread by the agency of social media, perhaps",0
684,"Also, we have now instant poetry and flash fiction",0
684,"These are jokes, of course",0

684,"I remember a lady with whom I shared a stage, reading utter drivel but in a most rousing way",0
684,"The audience, especially women, was bowled over",0
684,Yet the poetry itself was just rhetoric,0
684,Slam poetry is here to stay  it’d be great if it does not slam poetry,0
684,I see the future of poetry closely associated with the internet,0
684,"Podcasts, for example",0
684,But I am not sure if that takes away from the experience of hearing a good poet read his lines in real life,0
684,Poetry finds few takers today,0
684,"Is there a lack of mainstream publishers willing to publish poetry, a dwindling number of readers willing to buy it, or few bookshops ready to stock books of poetry?

At the risk of sounding contradictory, I believe there’s a rise in the audience",0
684,There is in fact a return of sorts,0
684,But very few publishers realise it,0
684,Bookshops tend not to store poetry collections simply because very few poets get media attention,0
684,"The general fever is fiction and, now, non-fiction",0
684,Which is why I believe poetry would be written in a state of helplessness,1
685,"Sanjoy Hazarika is one of the most credible and authoritative voices on North-East India, that triangular stretch of land beyond what is known as the Chicken’s Neck",1
685,"An award-winning journalist, formerly with the New York Times, Hazarika has written extensively about the North-East, a region which a majority, in what is known as ‘mainland India’, know little and understand even less so",1
685,"Strangers No More: New Narratives from India’s North-East is the latest from Hazarika following his earlier acclaimed works—Strangers of the Mist: Tales of War and Peace from India’s North-East and Rites of Passage: Border Crossings, Imagined Homelands, India‘s East and Bangladesh",1
685,"In that sense, Strangers No More is truly “the most comprehensive book yet available about India’s North-East”, as the book’s blurb aptly says",1
685,"North-East is an extremely complex region, both geographically and culturally—“nearly 96 per cent of the region’s borders are with other countries; only 4 per cent of the border is connected to the rest of India”",0
685,"Home to innumerable tribes, many of who do not trust the other, and immigrants from neighbouring regions who settled here over a century, the region is a complex anthropological mix",0
685,Add to this the fact that most borders in the region—both international and national—are disputed makes it more complicated,0
685,Hazarika threads through these complexities with a discerning eye and an unbiased manner,0
685,He traces the history of the region to detail the issues plaguing the region and understand the aspirations of the people,1
685,"Apart from shared ethnicities with neighbouring countries and China’s geo-political interests that makes the region a combustive political arena, one thing that comes out clearly in the book are the wrongly motivated and at time almost farcical Indian efforts to bring peace to the region",0
685,The book details historical mistakes and current vested interests that have alienated the people in the region,0
685,"Even 70 years after Independence, Indian authorities continue to be seen with mistrust",0
685,"The reason is not difficult to understand—false promises by the authorities over decades, failure to resolve burning issues and almost constant use of Disturbed Areas Act in the region that has resulted in grave human rights violations",0
685,The most vexatious issue has no doubt been rule by AFSPA,0
685,"The free hand given to the armed, paramilitary and police forces in the region under AFSPA, dating back to 1958, has been the biggest impediment in the integration of the region with the rest of India",0
685,"Hazarika brings out the horrors of the AFSPA rule through stories—from the much publicised shooting of Manorama and fast of Irom Sharmila to lesser known Ananda Kalita, who was shot in the head and yet miraculously survived, to Mohammed Azad Khan, a 12-year-old picked up from his home and beaten and shot in a rice field, to Felanee, a 15-year-old shot while she was trying to cross the barbed wire fence from India to Bangladesh",0
685,"Hazarika’s book is, in fact, a cry to remove AFSPA",0
685,"It cites the trailblazing example of Tripura, which through “good governance” and “political tact” “turned the clock back by lifting the Disturbed Areas Act, which essentially ends AFSPA rule and sends the troops back to their barracks",0
685,” Therein lies the hope for the rest of the region,0
686,"CHENNAI:In Priya Babu’s work, transwomen take centre stage",0
686,"She is a scriptwriter, filmmaker, a researcher, and a transwoman based in Madurai, with a keen interest in interpreting histories of her community",1
686,"Anyone familiar with her work would know that it shakes prejudices as we learn of transpersons’ lives in all fronts — from their duties as the queen’s apprentice during the Chola period, to their depiction in Bhakti literature",0
686,"In an interview with CE, she talks about her upcoming film and its drive to show the stark presence of transgenders’ lives in Tamil history",1
686,The idea for this documentary came when her previous film could not fully incorporate her research,0
686,"“It was on transgender folk art in Tamil Nadu, which released in 2005",1
686,"I had travelled across the state and collected a lot of information about the depiction of trans lives in Tholkapiam, Jeevakasintamani, Silapathikaram, and Bhakti literature,” she shares",0
686,"For about eight years after that, she collected books, and sought help from various centres including National Folklore Support Centre, Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department, Tanjavur Archaeology Department, Ramanathapuram Aranmanai, and centres in other parts of south Tamil Nadu",0
686,"She shares that her inquisitiveness was new to the people she met, as she asked ‘What were transgender relationships like in the confines of a place?’ ‘What circles did they move in?’ ‘What positions of power did they hold?’ and more importantly, for her film, ‘How could she picturise these histories from the past?’

“I thought docu-drama would be more interesting, so we can explore the representation of their lives better",0
686,"There are aranmanai scenes from Chola and Chera periods that have transpersons in decision-making positions,” she explains, adding that it is fully based on evidence",0
686,"Most of the pre-production work for the docu-drama is complete, there’s a lot left to be done",0
686,"She says that financial support has been

minimal so far, and most of it is volunteer driven",0
686,"“Production costs are going to be high, and while the technical team is almost in place, we are yet to do a recce and auditions, and figure out the logistics,” she adds",0
686,"To garner more support, a few months back, Priya launched an app called Idaiyinam",0
686,"It informs people about the film, and ways to offer support to the team",0
686,"As she prepares for the poster release and shooting scheduled to start mid-April, she admits there have been many challenges",0
686,"But being able to reclaim transgender histories, that was never erased in the first place, is the underlying intention of her work",1
686,"“Mainstreaming our histories, and making others sensitive to our lives, is what keeps my work happy and going,” she shares",1
687,"Book: Why I Killed the Mahatma -- Uncovering Godse's Defence; Author: Koenraad Elst; Publisher: Rupa; Pages: 251

""History will be kind to me for I intend to write it,"" Winston Churchill had bragged with his trademark flourish, underlining the significant role which victors play in scripting the histories of their respective eras",0
687,"Koenraad Elst's provocatively titled book ""Why I killed the Mahatma",0
687,""", is a dissertation examining Gandhi's killer Nathuram Godse's defence in court during his trial, which eventually led to his hanging",0
687,"And with this book, Elst, a Belgian Indologist, walks a path rarely trod on by other mainstream Indian historians, which involves the sensitive and precarious task of intellectualising Godse's rationale, which eventually led to the assassination",0
687,"Koenraad Elst's book 'Why I killed the Mahatma' (Photo | Amazon)

This is essential, according to Elst, who claims that a section of Indian historians have, for long, monopolised views on Gandhi's assassination, thereby eclipsing any other aspects linked to the saga which led to the Mahatma's killing, like Godse's point of view",0
687,"""The fact that he murdered the Mahatma has eclipsed every other fact in his fairly long and detailed statement",0
687,"We hope that this study will enable the readers to see Godse with their own eyes rather than through the eyes of those who have thus far monopolised the discourse on the Mahatma's murder,"" Elst says, while pointing out to the significance of Godse's insistence on taking the absolute onus for the assassination, in an attempt to absolve his friends and other alleged conspirators",0
687,"Elst also attempts to bring out similar traits between the nearly anonymous (at the time) killer and his larger-than-life victim, like the similarities in their respective childhoods, when both believed in a supernatural sense",0
687,"Godse, Elst says, as a child acted as the oracle of the family goddess, while Gandhi had invoked his inner voice to rational considerations right from a younger age",1
687,"""Logically following from the conviction, common to both Gandhi and Godse, that 'the problem of India was basically the problem of the Hindus', if there is another importance parallel: both were hard on their own Hindu society, not on Muslims,"" the author states in the book, which is bound to raise more than a few eyebrows",0
687,"Much like Gandhi, Elst maintains, Godse too refused to let Hindus lay the blame for their sufferings in the era preceding Independence and Partition elsewhere, but on themselves",1
687,"""It is remarkable that Godse, who profiles himself as a secular nationalist, puts a decisive part of the blame for the Pakistan movement on the British",0
687,"He makes no attempt to link the contemporary phenomenon of Islamic separatism with the fundamental doctrines of Islam,"" a passage in the book reads",0
687,"Interestingly, the book also attempts to train the spotlight on what Elst prefers to call the secular side of Godse",1
687,"The author claims that Godse swore by genuinely secular and democratic principles, so that all Indians should enjoy equal rights and complete equality on the basis of democracy and no special privileges on the basis of communal identity such as weightage in parliamentary representation of Muslims, something the ""so-called secularists"" of the era were in favour of",0
687,"""Congressites and leftist secularists, by contrast, supported communal representation and weightage back then, and still support separate Personal Law systems for different communities defined by religion today",0
687,"If words still have a meaning, Godse's vision of independent India's polity was more secular than that of self-styled secularists,"" Elst claims in his book",1
687,"Elst also points out to what he suggests is an inconsistency in Gandhi's usage of fasting as a tool for bringing about peace, alleging that the Mahatma used the tool to good effect only with people who admired and loved him, and never against his opponents",0
687,"""For instance, he did not use this weapon in order to compel the Muslim League to give up its demand for Pakistan",0
687,"Indeed, breaking a solemn promise, he failed to stake his life for the sake of India's unity,"" the book claims",1
687,"Elst's book is an attempt to provide an intellectual rationale for Godse's actions, while at the same time, not underlining the rights or the wrongs of the act of pumping bullets into the Mahatma, the first major and perhaps the most significant assassination in free India",0
687,"As contemporary India's political history changes course, such revisiting of past phenomena, occurrences and recording of an alternative discourse/s around them, may well trigger a new round of ideological churning",0
688,Globalisation's retreat and the consequent rise of a rather hyper form of nationalism -- which even seeks to confine indivisible human endeavours like art and science within borders -- is one of the most worrying trends of our time,0
688,"Equally of concern is the trade-off between prosperity and liberty, and a sense of conformity being forced on us",1
688,"How do we face these challenges? One way would be to go back to the thoughts of a charismatic French existentialist philosopher -- the man who identified the ""absurd"" existence we find ourselves in, and suggested ways of escaping it",0
688,"But Albert Camus, who staunchly stood for human freedom beyond the constraints of ideology, and opposed totalitarianism of all types, had dealt with these issues in the last two decades of his tragically short life",0
688,"And he expressed his views not only in his writings but also in public gatherings, from colleges to labour exchanges",1
688,"And in this installment of the thin, nearly-weightless, pocket-sized special edition of Penguin Modern Classics, we can hear Camus, who was noted for his incisive thought on serious issues of existence presented in a most accessible manner, deal with matters that were as important in his time as ours",0
688,"In ""Create Dangerously"", he dealt with the responsibility and the right of artists to their opinion against the backdrop of changing social and political dynamics and pressure -- a discourse that will strike a chord among Indian readers given the campaign against intolerance by many writers in the recent past",0
688,"Speaking at Sweden's ancient and prestigious Uppsala University in December 1957, a few days after he became the second-youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Camus, noting that writers attract criticism whether they speak or not, stressed they cannot -- and should not -- remain aloof",0
688,"Beginning in his inimitable style by citing the Oriental wise man's prayer to be spared from living in an exciting era, he quipped that none in the present age was spared as ""our era forces us to take an interest in it""",0
688,"Going on to show why this obligation of coming out of their comfort zone was necessary, he skilfully sketches out the major issues -- including the purpose of art, the artist's freedom and, especially, the attitude of the state",0
688,"The speech is also replete with key insights on related matters, including the relation between art and wealth, and of life and social purpose, the media through which forms of art are propagated, representation of life, artistic license, the comparative value of the nation and an individual and more that are still relevant now",0
688,"In ""Defence of Intelligence"", delivered in March 1945 at a meeting of a group seeking accord and amity in a just-liberated France -- even as the Second World War still raged, Camus made an eloquent plea against violence, hatred and the divisiveness they engendered",0
688,"Mincing no words at the barbarity they had just endured -- which he noted had also left its mark on the victims, some of whom retaliated in kind at the first chance -- he advocated curing ""poisoned hearts"" by ""saving one's intelligence""",0
688,"And intelligence here is a sense of reason, discernment and objectivity, not mere mental capability",1
688,"And finally in ""Bread and Freedom"", delivered at a labour exchange in May 1953, Camus, who was a leftist but never condoned Stalinist excesses, made a blazing attack on totalitarianism",1
688,"Saying that if some trends continued, one could foresee ""a Europe of concentration camps"", where ""the only people at liberty will be prison guards who will then have to lock up one another"", he sought to nail the pernicious claim that if citizens have their basic, economic needs met, they do not require political liberty",0
688,"Though speeches delivered decades back but on issues that have again resurfaced due to our inability to learn from history, Camus proves he is a voice beyond his age by his prescient assessment of crucial matters and passionate but well-reasoned arguments",0
688,Hope we can learn from him now,0

689,Most of your books are on love,0
689,I wrote my first book because of a personal tragedy and I walked the path to become an author,1
689,It was all about recalling memories I shared with my girlfriend who passed away,0
689,"I would close my eyes, experience that moment; it was emotional but then it helped me heal in a way",0
689,"But as far as my other works are concerned, I realised that once people enjoy a certain genre that you offer, there is a lot of acceptance you get as an author if you stick with the same",0
689,"Although predominantly I don’t enjoy writing on the genre ‘romance’, my focus is always on the plot that I choose",1
689,"For instance, the plot of one of my books was to make a young Indian gain interest in politics and it had to do with the Nirbhaya case",0
689,"So this is the subject that I want to write about, where I used romance to wrap the story in",1
689,"I realised that if I sugar coat my story with romance, the issues within it too will be read and becomes more interesting",0
689,"What inspires you to write each chapter?

Other authors and poets inspire me to write",0
689,"I would just be sitting in the morning, sipping my cup of tea, reading a piece of poetry, and all of a sudden I feel inspired by the writing, regardless of the subject and language",0
