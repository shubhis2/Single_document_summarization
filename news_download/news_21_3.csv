Now just pop a pill to stop blood clots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Now-just-pop-a-pill-to-stop-blood-clots/articleshow/4905951.cms,"Tue, 18 Aug 2009 08:24:34 GMT","Washington: Blood clots can now be stopped easily and without needles, says a new study.Known as deep-vein thrombosis, blood clots affect the large veins in the lower leg and thigh. They are responsible for killing hundreds of people worldwide, esp. after joint replacement surgery. If the clot breaks free and moves through the bloodstream, it can lodge in lungs, a condition known as pulmonary embolism which is often fatal.Treating blood clots with syringes after joint surgery is painful and can cause bleeding. Now, an international team has found a better way of preventing deadly blood clots without increasing the risk of bleeding, the 'New England Journal of Medicine' reported.In a double blind study of more than 3,000 patients, researchers tested a new type of anti-clotting drug called Apixaban, which is an oral medication. The medicine proved just as effective at preventing blood clots and reduced the risk of bleeding by half. Most importantly for patient convenience, it was much easier to use, they said.��� This is a major step in our fight to prevent DVT and the many unnecessary deaths each year caused by blood clots after joint replacement surgery.""We now have a better treatment that reduces the risk of bleeding, and a patient no longer has to endure injections by needle,"" team leader Gary Raskob of University of Oklahoma said.","Washington: Blood clots can now be stopped easily and without needles, says a new study.Known as deep-vein thrombosis, blood clots affect the large veins in the lower leg and thigh.

A cot mattress that mimics the womb,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/A-cot-mattress-that-mimics-the-womb/articleshow/4899153.cms,"Sun, 16 Aug 2009 11:28:25 GMT","LONDON: It's a dream come true for tired-out-moms - a revolutionary new cot mattress which mimics the sensation of the womb to keep babies happy at night.

The Easidream mattress, invented by a British mother- of-six, Lynda Harding, has a series of inflatable pads which when placed under the existing mattress, reduces the time to settle babies by up to 90%.

The pads gently fill with air and then deflate again, mimicking a rocking motion. And, a cuddly toy sheep clipped to the side of the cot broadcasts the sound of mother's heartbeat along with a choice of sounds like vacuum cleaner and music.

The motion of the pads also encourages babies to sleep on their backs, recommended as the safest position for babies under six months old, the 'Daily Mail' reported.

44-year-old Harding, who battled to get her youngest child Bradley to sleep as a baby, said: ""Sleep deprivation is draining. This product would have been a godsend for me so I'd like to see it help other parents.""

Now, researchers at the University of Brighton have also developed a prototype. The product will be launched at the Baby Show in London in October.

Jeanne Tarrant, from the Royal College of Midwives, said: ""Babies do respond to hearing their mother's heartbeat or white noise and it usually sends them to sleep. A rocking motion can also help.

10 home remedies to avoid swine flu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/10-home-remedies-to-avoid-swine-flu/articleshow/4888598.cms,"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 05:45:24 GMT","Are the rising swine flu casualties giving you jitters? Not sure how you can avoid falling prey to the growing epidemic? First and foremost, there is absolutely no need to panic.Here are some easy steps you can take to tackle a flu virus of any kind, including swine flu. It is not necessary to follow all the steps at once. You can pick and choose a combination of remedies that suit you best. However, if you are already suffering from flu, these measures can help only up to an extent.1. Have five duly washed leaves of Tulsi (known as Basil in English; medicinal name Ocimum sanctum) everyday in the morning. Tulsi has a large number of therapeutic properties. It keeps throat and lungs clear and helps in infections by way of strengthening your immunity.2. Giloi (medicinal name Tinospora cordifolia) is a commonly available plant in many areas. Take a one-foot long branch of giloi, add five to six leaves of Tulsi and boil in water for 15-20 minutes or long enough to allow the water to extract its properties. Add black pepper and sendha (salt used during religious fasts), rock or black salt, or Misri (crystalised sugar like lumps to make it sweet) according to taste. Let it cool a bit and drink this kadha (concoction) while still warm. It will work wonders for your immunity. If giloi plant is not available, get processed giloi powder from Hamdard or others, and concoct a similar drink once a day.3. A small piece of camphor (kapoor) approximately the size of a tablet should be taken once or twice a month. It can be swallowed with water by adults while children can take it along with mashed potatoes or banana because they will find it difficult to have it without any aides. Please remember camphor is not to be taken everyday, but only once each season, or once a month.4. Those who can take garlic, must have two pods of raw garlic first thing in the morning. To be swallowed daily with lukewarm water. Garlic too strengthens immunity like the earlier measures mentioned.5. Those not allergic to milk, must take a glass of hot or lukewarm milk every night with a small measure of haldi (turmeric).6. Aloe vera (gwarpatha) too is a commonly available plant. Its thick and long, cactus-like leaves have an odourless gel. A teaspoon gel taken with water daily can work wonders for not only your skin and joint pains, but also boost immunity.7. Take homeopathic medicines — Pyrogenium 200 and Inflenzium 200 in particular — five tablets three times a day, or two-three drops three times a day. While these are not specifically targeted at H1N1 either, these work well as preventive against common flu virus.8. Do Pranayam daily (preferably under guidance if you are already not initiated into it) and go for morning jog/walk regularly to keep your throat and lungs in good condition and body in fine fettle. Even in small measures, it will work wonders for your body's resistance against all such diseases which attack the nose, throat and lungs, besides keeping you fit.9. Have citrus fruits, particularly Vitamin C rich Amla (Indian gooseberry) juice. Since fresh Amla is not yet available in the market (not for another three to four months), it is not a bad idea to buy packaged Amla juice which is commonly available nowadays.10. Last but not the least, wash your hands frequently every day with soap and warm water for 15-20 seconds; especially before meals, or each time after touching a surface that you suspect could be contaminated with flu virus such as a door handle or a knob/handle, especially if you have returned from a public place or used public transport. Alcohol-based hand cleaners should be kept handy at all times and used until you can get soap and warm water.(The author is an avid reader and follower of alternative therapies including spiritual healing, ayurveda, yoga and homeopathy","First and foremost, there is absolutely no need to panic.Here are some easy steps you can take to tackle a flu virus of any kind, including swine flu.

Breast cancer cases surge as cervical dips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Breast-cancer-cases-surge-as-cervical-dips/articleshow/4861388.cms,"Wed, 05 Aug 2009 19:20:01 GMT","NEW DELHI: The good news: fewer women in India now suffer from cervical cancer - counted among the worst of killers. The bad news: breast cancer cases have shot up alarmingly, across the country.A landmark analysis of cancer cases in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore between 1982-2005 (24 years) by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has found that while cervical cancer cases dipped, in some cases by almost 50%, the incidence of breast cancer doubled. And, the trends contained in ICMR's yet-to-be-released report `Time Trends in Cancer Incidence Rates (1982-2005)', were universal in all four cities.In case of cervical cancer, this is how the cases have dropped: In 1982, Bangalore reported 32.4 new cases of cervical cancer in women per 100,000 population every year. The number dipped to 27.2 in 1991, 17 in 2001 and 18.2 in 2005.Delhi, whose records are available from 1988, saw 25.9 new cases of cervical cancer per 100,000 population the same year. It then dipped to 19.1 in 1998 and then to 18.9 in 2005.Mumbai, which recorded 17.9 new cases of cervical cancer per 100,000 population in 1982, recorded 12.7 new cases in 2005.Chennai recorded a fall of almost 50% in cases of cervical cancer in this period of 24 years. In 1982, Chennai recorded 41 cases per 100,000 population; nearly a decade later, in 1991, Chennai's figure of new cases dipped to 33.4. In 2005, new cases fell further to 22 per 100,000 population.Caused by the Human Papiloma Virus (HPV), cervical cancer is often called the poor woman's disease. It was earlier believed that cervical cancer was most common in India, with more than 1.3 lakh new cases reported each year and 74,000 women dying annually from the disease.While Bangalore saw breast cancer cases more than double since 1982 - 15.8 in a population of one lakh in 1982 to 32.2 in 2005 - Chennai recorded 33.5 new cases of breast cancer in 2005 against 18.4 in 1982.Delhi recorded 24.8 new cases of breast cancer a year per 100,000 women which rose to 32.2 in 2005. Mumbai recorded 20.8 new cases of breast cancer per 100,000 population in 1982 which increased by almost 10% in 2005.ICMR director general and secretary of the department of health research Dr V M Katoch told TOI, ``The decline in cases of cancer cervix has been seen across all cancer registries. Factors like late age of marriage and fewer children could be responsible for the decline.''Chief of medical oncology at AIIMS and head of the Delhi Cancer Registry Dr Vinod Raina told TOI, ``Increasing number of women are now delivering in institutions which has greatly improved their personal hygiene. Women now marry late and give birth to fewer children, all of which have led to a dip in cervical cancer cases.''Ironically, these are the same factors, according to Dr Raina, which has increased breast cancer rates in India.``Western lifestyle, increased consumption of fat products, obesity, late marriages, delayed child bearing and less number of children being conceived leading to reduced breastfeeding and use of some contraceptives, are all believed to be behind this increased risk of breast cancer. This cancer is also inevitable with an ageing population,'' he added.Dr Raina, however, was quick to say that breast cancer rate in India was much less than that in the West which records around 100 new cases per 100,000 population every year.According to Dr Katoch, the report depicts changes in the incidence rates of cancer and is the first for any chronic disease in India.Certain anatomical sites of cancer have shown a significantly steady increase across all registries, breast cancer being one of them. ``This data will now help galvanize India's health system and tell us how we can improve diagnostic capabilities and specialists in some types of cancer affecting Indians most,'' Dr Katoch said.","NEW DELHI: The good news: fewer women in India now suffer from cervical cancer - counted among the worst of killers.

"UV radiation blinding rural folk, finds study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/UV-radiation-blinding-rural-folk-finds-study/articleshow/4847122.cms,"Sat, 01 Aug 2009 23:25:10 GMT","CHENNAI: Why is every alternate person in rural India above the age of 40 blinded by cataract when only one in five in cities has the disease? This was the question that troubled a group of researchers at Sankara Nethralaya in the city nearly two years ago. Today, they have an answer exposure to ultraviolet radiation.The team, comprising optometrists and ophthalmologists, found that though the level of ultraviolet radiation was higher in Chennai than in neighbouring Tiruvallur due to pollution, ocular exposure to these rays was higher in the rural areas than in the city, increasing the risk.""Our study shows that it's clearly because of the lifestyle changes most city residents have adopted,"" said Dr Ronnie George, consultant, Sankara Nethralaya. Screening the profiles of over 800 people equally divided in urban and rural areas the team calculated ""the lifetime ocular UV exposure"" in rural and urban areas.""The study proved that no matter where they are or what they do agriculture, poultry or construction labour hats and/or sunglasses are required to block ultraviolet rays from the eye. It has got to do more with common sense than style,"" he said.Arivunidhi K, 47, an agricultural labourer who was operated for cataract in June, understands this very well. ""Almost every working member of my family has disease. It progressed faster in my wife and she was operated last year,"" he said. While Arivunidhi and his wife Kalaiselvi are among the few lucky ones, many aren't.A cataract is a clouding of the lens. India is now home to more than 15 million blind, the bulk of which is due to cataract and therefore reversible. A recent study on cataract conducted by the hospital, in which 7,774 patients were screened, showed that nearly 50% of rural citizens above 40 years were affected. In the urban areas, nearly 20% were affected.Cataracts are classified according to where they occur. The cataract linked to ultraviolet exposure is the cortical cataract and forms in the outer layer of the lens. People with higher lifetime ocular exposure were more at risk for this type of cataract than those with the lowest exposure.Lifetime ocular exposure is calculated with formulae the scientists developed based on an individual's case history, including profession, hours of stay in the sun and place of residence. The hospital sourced the dosage of ultraviolet radiation from Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Systems. According to the international initiative that studies ozone depletion, the UV index in Tiruvallur was 6.9 and in Chennai 7.1.Since January, the team also measured the extent of ultraviolet radiation in Chennai and the neighbouring districts. ""We exposed polysulfone strips, which are capable of absorbing the UV flux from sunlight, and then read the measurement under a collimator, a device that narrows a beam of particles or waves. The gap between the city and the rural areas was evident in this as well,"" said Rashima Asokan, an optometrist.Studies have shown that extensive exposure to sunlight, particularly ultraviolet B radiation, could increase the risk of a major form of cataracts, besides skin cancer. UV-A radiation is more associated with tanning of the skin.Going by the radiation level, Chennai should have been at a greater risk. ""'We looked at the wherefore, not the why,"" Dr George said. The analysis gave the answers. The lifetime ocular exposure for an urbanite was 1.32 against 3.16 for those in the rural areas.That clearly explained why people in rural areas got the disease at least five years earlier than their counterparts in the city or why the incidence was more than double.""Where there is enough sun to give sunburns, it's only wise to block the sun. If glasses are not affordable, we would prescribe at least a hat,"" said Rashima.","""Our study shows that it's clearly because of the lifestyle changes most city residents have adopted,"" said Dr Ronnie George, consultant, Sankara Nethralaya.

Fuelling the alarming trend is the rise in diabetes prevalence in rural areas.The unexpected surge has forced the Diabetes Atlas, a global report on the disorder, to plan a revision of the India-specific numbers in October. ���A recent study we did in Chennai and Kancheepuram shows an increase in prevalence of 40% in urban areas in six years, and 49% in rural areas in three years. This proves the general hypothesis of diabetes affecting more urbanites than rural people wrong,��� says Indian Diabetes Research Foundation president Dr A Ramachandran.According to Diabetes Atlas published in 2007, there are 246 million diabetics across the world, with 80% of them in the developing and underdeveloped countries. India, according to these statistics, has 40.9 million diabetics, closely followed by China with 39.8 million diabetics. It was predicted that by 2025, India will have 69.9 million people and China will have 59.3 million people with diabetics.���When the atlas was released, the hypothesis was that the prevalence in cities was higher than in rural areas. Now it looks like there is a change. We need to see how many states in India show the same trend. That will help us revise the policies and strategies to battle diabetes,��� says Ramachandran, who is to be part of the committee working out the revised data.The shift, according to Endocrine Diagnostic Centre and Diabetes Care Centre medical director Dr S Murthy, is possibly because of the urbanisation of rural areas. ���Changing lifestyles and gentic factors lead to metabolic disorders,��� he says. Dr V Mohan, who heads the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, says the country is now at a crossroads and the gap between urban-rural incidence of the disorder is decreasing. ���It happens differently in different places. In Kerala, the incidence is already higher in rural areas,��� he says.Dr Anoop Misra, who heads the department of diabetology at Fortis Hospital in Delhi says a country-wide study is required before revision. ���No formula evolved to extrapolate a region-specific study will be error-free.

In fact, surfactants are often one of the first treatments given to a premature infant to help ensure the lungs inflate and develop properly.In addition, all cells within the lung need lipids as signaling molecules and to build their internal and external membranes.But in earlier work, Drs.

Even minor stress can result in blisters, wounds, and skin loss with scar formation.Depending on disease severity, internal organs may likewise be affected, leading to critical dysfunctions.The disease significantly reduces the patients' quality of life; often it is also life-threatening.By the time, seven-year-old Hassan was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit at Katholisches Klinikum Bochum in June 2015, 60 per cent of his epidermis was lost.""He suffered from severe sepsis with high fever, and his body weight had dropped to a mere 17 kilogrammes - a life- threatening condition,"" said Tobias Rothoeft, Consultant at the University Children's Hospital at Katholisches Klinikum Bochum.Due to the poor prognosis, doctors opted for an experimental therapy: the transplantation of genetically modified epidermal stem cells.

At this important crossroads, it is thought that they encountered and had sexual rendezvous with the Neanderthals.Genomic evidence shows that this ancient interbreeding occurred, and Western Asia is the most likely spot where it happened.Researchers at the University at Buffalo (UB) in the US explored the legacy of these interspecies trysts, with a focus on Western Asia, where the first relations may have occurred.

Another includes a variant tied to a lowered risk of malaria. The relations that our ancestors had with Neanderthals tens of thousands of years ago may continue to exert an influence on our well-being today, Gokcumen said.In addition to exploring the specific functions of genetic material that the Turkish population inherited from Neanderthals, the study also examined the Neanderthals' influence on human populations in Western Asia more broadly.However, the research shows that people living in this area today have relatively little Neanderthal DNA compared to people in other parts of the world. The team analysed genomic data from dozens of Western Asian individuals and observed that, on average, with a few exceptions, these populations carry less Neanderthal DNA than Europeans, Central Asians and East Asians.The differences in Neanderthal ancestry between Western Asian and other populations may be due to the region's unique position in human history, Taskent added.","WASHINGTON: Western Asia is the most likely spot where modern humans first encountered and had sexual rendezvous with a different hominid species - the Neanderthals, a study suggests.When the ancestors of modern humans migrated out of Africa , they passed through the Middle East and Turkey before heading deeper into Asia and Europe.

Corals developing taste for plastics: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/corals-developing-taste-for-plastics-study/articleshow/61223346.cms,"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 10:55:05 GMT","WASHINGTON: Corals may have developed a preference for consuming plastic bits, putting them at risk of being choked by the indigestible materials, a study has found.Scientists have long known that marine animals mistakenly eat plastic debris because the tiny bits of floating plastic might look like prey.The study of plastic ingestion by corals by researchers from Duke University in the US suggests there may be an additional reason for the potentially harmful behaviour.Visual cues, such as a resemblance to prey, do not factor into the appeal because corals have no eyes, researchers said.""Corals in our experiments ate all types of plastics but preferred unfouled microplastics by a threefold difference over microplastics covered in bacteria,"" said Austin S Allen, a PhD student at Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment.""This suggests the plastic itself contains something that makes it tasty,"" said Allen.""When plastic comes from the factory, it has hundreds of chemical additives on it. Any one of these chemicals or a combination of them could be acting as a stimulant that makes plastic appealing to corals,"" said Alexander C Seymour, from Duke's Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Center.Further research will be needed to identify the specific additives that make the plastic so tasty to corals and determine if the same chemicals act as feeding stimulants to other marine species, researchers said.Microplastics, tiny pieces of weathered plastic less than five millimetres in diameter, began accumulating in the oceans four decades ago and are now ubiquitous in the marine environment.They pose a major threat to foraging sea animals, including many species of birds, turtles, fish, marine mammals and invertebrates.Since plastic is largely indigestible, it can lead to intestinal blockages, create a false sense of fullness or reduce energy reserves in animals that consume it.""About eight per cent of the plastic that coral polyps in our study ingested was still stuck in their guts after 24 hours,"" said Allen.The biological effects of most of these compounds are still unknown, but some, such as phthalates, are confirmed environmental estrogens and androgens - hormones that affect sex determination.Researchers conducted their two-part study using corals collected from waters off the North Carolina coast.In their first experiment, they offered small amounts of eight different types of microplastics to the corals to see if the animals would eat the bite-sized bits versus other similarly-sized items offered to them, such as clean sand.""We found that the corals ate all of the plastic types we offered and mostly ignored sand,"" Allen said.In the second experiment, they put groups of coral into separate feeding chambers. Each group was offered the same amount weathered plastics for a 30-minute period.Some groups got only particles of unfouled microplastics while others got only particles of weathered microplastics fouled with a bacterial biofilm.This experiment verified that the corals would eat both types of plastic, but preferred the clean type by a three-to- one margin.The researchers hope their findings will encourage scientists to explore the role taste plays in determining why marine organisms ingest microplastics.","""Corals in our experiments ate all types of plastics but preferred unfouled microplastics by a threefold difference over microplastics covered in bacteria,"" said Austin S Allen, a PhD student at Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment.

'Daydreaming' brain network helps us perform routine tasks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/daydreaming-brain-network-helps-us-perform-routine-tasks/articleshow/61200118.cms,"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 09:22:16 GMT","LONDON: The brain network involved in daydreaming plays an important role in allowing us to perform routine tasks efficiently, without investing too much time and energy, a study has found.Scientists at the University of Cambridge in the UK showed that far from being just 'background activity', the 'default mode network' involved in daydreaming may be essential to helping us perform tasks on autopilot.The findings have relevance to brain injury, particularly following traumatic brain injury, where problems with memory and impulsivity can substantially compromise social reintegration.They may also have relevance for mental health disorders, such as addiction, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, where particular thought patterns drive repeated behaviours, and the mechanisms of anaesthetic agents and other drugs on the brain.Previously, scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine had found that a collection of brain regions appeared to be more active during such states of rest.This network was named the 'default mode network' (DMN). While it has since been linked to, among other things, daydreaming, thinking about the past, planning for the future, and creativity, its precise function is unclear.In the new research published in the journal Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, scientists showed that the DMN plays an important role in allowing us to switch to 'autopilot' once we are familiar with a task.In the study, 28 volunteers took part in a task while lying inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Functional MRI (fMRI) measures changes in brain oxygen levels as a proxy for neural activity.Participants were shown four cards and asked to match a target card to one of these cards.There were three possible rules - matching by colour, shape or number. Volunteers were not told the rule, but rather had to work it out for themselves through trial and error.The most interesting differences in brain activity occurred when comparing the two stages of the task - acquisition (where the participants were learning the rules by trial and error) and application (where the participants had learned the rule and were now applying it).During the acquisition stage, the dorsal attention network, which has been associated with the processing of attention-demanding information, was more active.However, in the application stage, where participants utilised learned rules from memory, the DMN was more active.In this stage, the stronger the relationship between activity in the DMN and in regions of the brain associated with memory, such as the hippocampus, the faster and more accurately the volunteer was able to perform the task.This suggested that during the application stage, the participants could efficiently respond to the task using the rule from memory.""Rather than waiting passively for things to happen to us, we are constantly trying to predict the environment around us,"" said Deniz Vatansever , former student at the University of Cambridge.""Our evidence suggests it is the default mode network that enables us do this. It is essentially like an autopilot that helps us make fast decisions when we know what the rules of the environment are,"" said Vatansever, who is now based at the University of York ""So for example, when you are driving to work in the morning along a familiar route, the default mode network will be active, enabling us to perform our task without having to invest lots of time and energy into every decision,"" he said.","LONDON: The brain network involved in daydreaming plays an important role in allowing us to perform routine tasks efficiently, without investing too much time and energy, a study has found.Scientists at the University of Cambridge in the UK showed that far from being just 'background activity', the 'default mode network' involved in daydreaming may be essential to helping us perform tasks on autopilot.The findings have relevance to brain injury, particularly following traumatic brain injury, where problems with memory and impulsivity can substantially compromise social reintegration.They may also have relevance for mental health disorders, such as addiction, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, where particular thought patterns drive repeated behaviours, and the mechanisms of anaesthetic agents and other drugs on the brain.Previously, scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine had found that a collection of brain regions appeared to be more active during such states of rest.This network was named the 'default mode network' (DMN).

It is essentially like an autopilot that helps us make fast decisions when we know what the rules of the environment are,"" said Vatansever, who is now based at the University of York ""So for example, when you are driving to work in the morning along a familiar route, the default mode network will be active, enabling us to perform our task without having to invest lots of time and energy into every decision,"" he said.","['daydreaming', 'routine', 'stage', 'helps', 'perform', 'tasks', 'participants', 'mode', 'brain', 'university', 'rules', 'network', 'dmn', 'task']",

As a part of a crucial update to the messaging app's policy, it will now share user data with its parent company, social networking giant Facebook. The litigants have argued that WhatsApp's terms of service are “deceptive"" and difficult to comprehend for a layperson.



Earlier this month, the Delhi HC had sought responses from government agencies, DoT and Trai on the same. Now, the Chief Justice-led bench in the High Court has asked WhatsApp and Facebook to file their responses by September 20 (the next hearing has been set for September 21).

2 / 6 What is a privacy policy? A privacy policy for a technology company such as WhatsApp or Facebook tells you how and where they will use your information -- your phone number, your contacts, your pictures, etc. A policy sets down whether and how these will be used to serve you ads, or to give you software updates. ...Read more

3 / 6 What does WhatsApp privacy policy say now? WhatsApp had started out with an emphatic focus on never having any ads ever on its app. But after Facebook bought it in February 2014, change appeared to be inevitable. This August, they announced updates to their privacy policy.



They are now open to serving ads and marketing information on their app. They are also open to building transaction models within it. (Think booking flight tickets on Whatsapp.) That can only be possible if WhatsApp shares some of your data with whichever airline you choose.

5 / 6 How those Facebook ads work? Imagine being fed with more information in what you may or may not be interested in buying. Some Facebook users already have linked their phone number with the social networking giant.

Fitbit Charge 2 review: Towards a healthier you,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/reviews/Fitbit-Charge-2-review-Towards-a-healthier-you/articleshow/54328890.cms,"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 10:42:54 GMT","Gadgets and technology help us in doing nearly everything better and staying fit is no exception. Whether you’re a long-term fitness buff or just getting started on the path of getting into shape, a fitness tracker is one of the best gadgets one can get. These wrist-worn (generally) devices can not only track human body’s vital signs like heart rate, but also log fitness-related data such as step count, calories burnt, sleep activity and more. This data can be then used to create personalized fitness goals and diet plans, thus leading to a healthier lifestyle.When it comes to fitness trackers, Fitbit is a name that needs no introduction. The company recently launched two new products – Charge 2 and Flex 2. Of these, the more expensive Charge 2 is an upgrade to the Fitbit Charge HR, which is now almost two years old.We tested the Fitbit Charge 2 for a few days, using it for tracking everything from sleeping patterns to daily walks. So, is the Fitbit Charge 2 and its promise of a healthier lifestyle any good, especially at an asking price of Rs 14,999? Let’s find out.Fitbit Charge 2 is essentially comprises two components – tracker module and wrist band. The wrist band is made from a flexible elastomer material and comes with a stainless-steel buckle for fastening the Charge 2 around the wrist. The outer side of the band is textured, while the underside is smooth. The wrist band is removable and can be swapped with one of the many designer bands, which have to be purchased separately. Since it’s sweat proof, the wrist band doesn’t irritate the skin even when the Charge 2 is worn on the wrist for an extended period of time.As for the tracker module itself, its frame is made from stainless steel. On the top rests a slightly curved black glass, under which hides a large (at least as compared to the Charge HR) OLED display. The left and right sides of the frame are chamfered and a navigation button lies on the left, the only button on the Fitbit Charge 2.Flip the Charge 2 and you see the optical heart rate tracker with two flashing LEDs (one each at the top and bottom of the tracking chip). There are also three charging contacts at the bottom, which work by making contact with the pins on the clip-on charger. Other important components include a 3-axis accelerometer, an altimeter and a vibration motor.Overall, we found the design and build quality of the Fitbit Charge 2 to be really good. While the tracker module is quite solid, the wrist band is flexible yet sturdy enough to withstand daily wear and tear.Fitbit Charge 2 comes with a touch-capable OLED screen that automatically turns on when the wearer flicks the wrist, although this functionality can be disabled in the Fitbit app. The display can also be turned on with a double-tap or by pressing the navigation button on the side.Though the display shows time and date by default, users also have the option to choose from the various styles available. To change the display style, simply select it from the ‘Clock Display’ option in the Fitbit app and sync the tracker with the app. The display can be single-tapped repeatedly to flip through daily activity stats like calories burnt and floors climbed.As for the navigation, pressing the navigation button on the left repeatedly moves through various menu options (e.g. Heart Rate, Stopwatch). While a menu item is active, its related options can be cycled through by tapping the display. Lastly, long-pressing the side navigation button starts/stops the function associated with a menu item (e.g. Run).Interestingly, on-screen options can also be shuffled through by tapping anywhere on the wristband.Fitbit Charge 2 works in tandem with the Fitbit app (available on all platforms). You also need to create a free Fitbit account (if you don’t already have one) to login to the app. The account/profile creation includes entering essential body statistics like weight and height, as these are required for setting up personalized meal plans and weight goals.Once you login with your Fitbit account, it’s generally easy to pair the Charge 2 with the smartphone over Bluetooth using the app. But sometimes, the tracker does take a bit of a trial-and-error to get paired up. After pairing, you can simply wear the Charge 2 on the wrist (it can be worn on either of the wrists) and it will start doing its thing. The tracker syncs with the smartphone over Bluetooth every time the app is launched. It can be manually synchronized as well. Also, the smartphone that Fitbit Charge 2 is paired with needs to be connected to a network so that logged data can be synchronized to your Fitbit account The ‘Dashboard’ is the default landing section of the app. It displays a summarized list of all the metrics that are tracked by Fitbit Charge 2, including steps walked, calories burnt, floors climbed and sleep activity. Tapping on any logged parameter gives its logged values for the past days, with the last week’s data arranged in the form of a bar graph.The primary daily goal is set to steps by default, but can be changed via the tracker settings in the app. All data logs reset automatically at the start of the next day (00:00 hrs).During our extensive testing spanning over the course of almost a week (which included wearing the device almost 24x7), we found the Fitbit Charge 2 to be really good at logging different parameters. It detects activities like sleeping automatically and heart rate tracking is reliably accurate. Moreover, step logging is almost real-time.Fitbit Charge 2 comes with ‘guided breathing sessions’ (2min or 5min in length) feature. It lets you practice relaxed breathing by guiding you through inhale and exhale actions. This is something we liked a lot.There’s also multi-sport tracking built-in. It can track activity when you’re lifting weights, running on the treadmill, cycling or even working out generally. All this data is then synced to the companion app . In our testing, multi-sport tracking worked as expected.One feature we’d like to talk about is ‘move reminders’. To help you stay through the entire day, Fitbit Charge 2 vibrates on an hourly basis, encouraging you to take at least 250 steps (roughly equivalent to a few minutes of walking). Of course, the reminders can be customized from the tracker’s settings in the app.Fitbit Charge 2’s ‘connected GPS’ functionality uses the GPS in your smartphone (provided it’s the same the tracker is paired with) to track your route, thus helping in getting real-time statistics like distance travelled. During our testing, the feature worked quite well. That said, how accurate it is depends on numerous factors such as the quality of GPS satellite lock-in and the connection between the smartphone and tracker.If any of your friends uses a Fitbit fitness tracker, you can compare your fitness stats and take part in challenges together. However, we weren’t able to test this feature out.A really useful feature of the Fitbit Charge 2 is smartphone notifications. These include alerts about calls, text messages (SMS, WhatsApp and Hangouts) and calendar events. In our testing, notifications worked exceptionally well. Consequently, we had to check our smartphone less often. But even with that, we found the alerts functionality to be limited. Competing products like the Garmin vivosmart HR are much better in this regard, offering not only email and social media alerts, but also the ability to control music playback and some other devices.Coming to the battery life, we found it to be really good. Fitbit claims that the Charge 2 can last up to five days on a single charge and indeed, the battery lasted about four and a half days (even with 24x7 tracking) before needing to be recharged.The new Fitbit Charge 2 ticks nearly all the right boxes. It’s comfortable for wearing all-day, supports real-time tracking of numerous activities and the notification alerts are all good. But there are a few negatives too, such as the often inconsistent Bluetooth syncing and the lack of music control functionality.At Rs 14,999, we’d say that Fitbit Charge 2 is a pretty solid and well-rounded fitness tracker and definitely recommended. For those looking at alternatives, the Garmin vivosmart HR is a great option.","Of these, the more expensive Charge 2 is an upgrade to the Fitbit Charge HR, which is now almost two years old.We tested the Fitbit Charge 2 for a few days, using it for tracking everything from sleeping patterns to daily walks.

Your new gadget is just an EMI away,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/computing/Your-new-gadget-is-just-an-EMI-away/articleshow/54330637.cms,"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 12:16:39 GMT","What's keeping you from buying that smartphone you had set your eyes on for ages? If you're a student or a young professional, chances are that you simply don't have enough to spare for the buy . While the former does not have regular channels of income, the latter may struggle to save enough after paying the bills. A convenient solution is to pay it off in EMIs. However, this is easier said than done, since bank loans come with their own set of conditions and in-store EMI schemes require credit cards and offer only limited options in terms of inventory . Finomena , a startup with a unique system of verification and loan approval, offers an alternative. It is a customer-experience driven fintech platform that enables inclusion by offering easy access to credit for people who have never taken a loan before, and hence do not have a credit score .Moreover, it allows you to register online and simply browse ecommerce sites and choose the gadget you want.After that you can choose from the financing and EMI options and apply with a single click.The phrase 'financial inclusion' evokes the idea of a section of people without access to basic banking services. This is why one of the government's primary initiatives in facilitating financial inclusion has been to open bank accounts through the Jan Dhan Yojana . However, a bank account alone does not ensure access to credit. A section that gets largely left out in terms of access to loans and credit cards, despite holding bank accounts, includes students, young professionals and the self-employed.More than 75% of Indians do not have a traditional credit bureau score.""We cannot rely too much on traditional models to gauge the credit score of a potential client as traditional data for these people doesn't exist.They might not have traditional income proof but with the power of a smartphone, they are leaving a massive digital footprint,"" says Abhishek Garg, cofounder, Finomena. The platform uses this big data to create machine learning-based risk and credit scoring systems that take into account over 20,000 data points to assess the credit worthiness of a borrower.Shashank Singh, 26, may be a lawyer at the Delhi High Court, but securing a loan from a bank was nearly impossible. ""As an advocate, my income fluctuates month to month , which is why banks are reluctant to issue credit cards to me or approve my loan applications,"" he says. When he wanted to purchase an iPhone 6S, Singh approached several banks for a loan, but was turned down each time. He started looking for alternatives and chanced upon Finomena. ""They had a one-on-one conversation with me about their processes, and sent someone to pick up the documents from my home. My loan was approved within a day,"" says Singh.A credit score is a three digit numeric summary of your entire credit history. It is prepared based on the information provided in your Credit Information Report. The credit score normally ranges between 300 and 900.Most banks and financial institutions rely on this figure to determine the credit worthiness of potential bor rowers. In fact, 79% of the loans approved are for individuals with a score over 750.However, this is a setback for the young unbanked population since they may not have a credit score at all, resulting in a vicious cycle.Finomena's founders, Riddhi Mittal and Abhishek Garg, did extensive research about loan disbursal mechanisms and the demographic of borrowers, which revealed that most banks and NBFCs steer clear of the students and young professionals because traditional modes of KYC data collection don't work for them. “Most of our customers are in their first jobs, or self-employed with no traditional proof,“ says Mittal.While there are a few options available to customers for buying high-end gadgets on an EMI basis, they often have hidden clauses. In-store EMI programmes require the customer to have a credit card. However, less than 2% Indians are credit card holders.These schemes also have set tenures and EMI amounts payable by the customer. Finomena has taken it one step further by introducing FMIs or flexible monthly installments.Viren Makwana, an IT student who also has a part-time job, was pleasantly surprised to learn that he could choose the down-payment amount, as well as how much he wanted to pay each month for buying a laptop.The 21-year-old settled for a monthly payment of Rs 2,000 to pay off the loan over a 12-month period.""Initially I didn't believe that online EMIs were possible, but once I spoke to a Finomena representative, I was reassured that the process would work,"" he says.","However, this is easier said than done, since bank loans come with their own set of conditions and in-store EMI schemes require credit cards and offer only limited options in terms of inventory .

Why the Competition Commission of India is wrong in penalising Google,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/why-the-competition-commission-of-india-is-wrong-in-penalising-google/story-AgYueA0upbUyS319uQ1n6K.html,"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 06:23:57 GMT","Last week, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) imposed a $21.17 million fine on Googlefor “search bias” and abuse of its dominant position. The Commission found that Google through its search design had placed its commercial flight search function at a prominent position on the search results page to the disadvantage of other businesses trying to gain market access. I was intrigued by this order because Google is not in the travel business, and I couldn’t understand how its behaviour could be anti-competitive unless it was using its search engine to steal customers away from competitors.

I decided to try things out for myself. I typed “flight” into the Google’s search box and scrolled through the results page. After the obligatory advertisements at the top, I noticed a box with a link to a page called ‘Google Flights’. When I clicked on it, I was taken to a new page packed with destination suggestions and best price offers. It even had a neat interface that allowed me to hover over a spot on the map and find out how much it would cost to fly there. I realised why this irritated vertical search engines.

But I still couldn’t understand what was anti-competitive about all this. After all, if Google was going to use its search prowess to steal customers away, it needs to sell tickets. I couldn’t imagine why a global search behemoth, whose business model was designed around a highly efficient but entirely automated ad auction platform, would want to have anything to do with a low-margin, high-touch business such as flight ticketing. So I decided to find out for myself and book a flight. I selected a destination, travel dates and flight options and looked at the options I was given.

The first option was to buy the ticket directly from the airline but every other option pointed me to various vertical search engines — taking me right back to where I started.

I was right. Google was not in the travel business. All it had done was devise a better, more intuitive way to organise search results in order to improve the user experience. Google Flight is not a new business vertical that books your tickets for you.

All it does is offer a price comparison accessible directly from the search page of all available flights to a given destination. This is exactly the sort of innovation that Internet companies should be encouraged to do: finding new ways to improve their offerings as long as they do not adversely affect the interests of customers or competitors. I can’t see what is anti-competitive about that. After all, any customer who wants to book a flight from among the search results served up on the Google Flight page has to do so from the vertical search engines that were

complaining that they were being sidelined.

It’s disappointing that CCI, which took such a progressive view in the recent Ola case, did not apply the same rationale to address these nuances in the Google decision. Competition laws may have been designed for the offline world but when we use it to regulate large online players, it is imperative that we reorient our thinking so that we can better address the challenges of the big data age.

Today, customers benefit from network effects. The larger an Internet company grows the better it can serve its customers by leveraging data at scale to offer features and services that are otherwise impossible to achieve. If competition law is to be deployed to the benefit of the end consumer, we must allow Internet companies to better leverage the advantages of scale. High market share and dominance are no longer antitrust concerns. What is important is the conduct of a dominant market player and whether it is using its dominance to stifle innovation and/or competition.

The dissenting opinion in the Google case seems to have held this view: they accused the majority of having “…woven a narrative of hypothetical anti–competitive foreclosure”, referring to the extent to which the majority opinion has been based on the anticipation of harm without any evidence to that effect.

It is unfortunate for the evolution of Indian competition jurisprudence that they could not persuade the majority.

Falcon Heavy is a game changer in the space race,https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/falcon-heavy-is-a-game-changer-in-the-space-race/story-o2fXrhgQ0jSA41g16Ba8kJ.html,"Wed, 07 Feb 2018 12:57:38 GMT","On Tuesday, the world’s most powerful rocket ever was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy was successfully tested on its first attempt, an achievement that is important for two reasons: One, Falcon Heavy, which is essentially an assembling of three Falcon 9s (SpaceX’s workhorse), is now way ahead — and by ahead, really ahead — of competition in the so-called heavy-lift category. It can place about 64 tonnes payload, which is more than twice the payload of its nearest competitor ULA’s Delta 4 Heavy, in a single launch into the Lower Earth Orbit (LEO). The scientific and commercial windows this opens are many. It will enable the launch of heavier payloads, encourage the private sector to participate in space-related missions, and also, as seen across social media, get planetary scientists discussing its impact. Simply put, Falcon Heavy is a game changer in the space race.

Second, SpaceX , a company promoted by Elon Musk, has shown that it can not only easily reach the LEO (and go beyond), but has also done this using reusable boosters which will drastically cut the costs of launching satellites. At an estimate of about $90 million per launch, it already costs only about a fourth the current rate for launches in that payload category.

It’s not that the launch was a complete success. There were a few hiccups. Mr Musk’s Tesla Roadster, the mock payload on Falcon Heavy, which was supposed to revolve around the Sun at a distance of the Mars’ orbit, has overshot its trajectory and is now in the asteroid belt, between Mars and Jupiter and precariously close to the Ceres’ orbit. The second hiccup — one which should be bothering Mr Musk more — is the failure of the main booster to dock on the drone ship, showing that the rocket’s ocean-borne landing is yet to be perfected.

With Tuesday’s launch, Mr Musk proved that he is not only an entrepreneur, but also a great public relations tactician (and, of course, fan-boy par excellence) . The Roadster can be seen as space junk, because except for its novelty factor, there’s no scientific or academic purpose for sending an automobile into space. Adding to this is the fact that the mannequin in the driver’s seat is wearing a SpaceX spacesuit, and David Bowie’s Space Oddity is playing in endless loop on the radio in the car, and the glove compartment has a copy of Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy. The car’s dashboard also has a message that says “Don’t Panic”, the enduring tenet of the Hitchhiker books.

As Mr Musk said: “It’s kind of silly and fun, but silly and fun things are important.”","On Tuesday, the world’s most powerful rocket ever was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States.

Monopolies of social media platforms need to be disrupted,https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/monopolies-of-social-media-platforms-need-to-be-disrupted/story-qxkJv4FJSu1VQLDwce25TI.html,"Fri, 02 Feb 2018 01:51:03 GMT","We were warned. The venture capitalist and Netscape founder Marc Andreessen wrote a widely read essay in 2011 entitled, “Why Software Is Eating the World.” But we didn’t take Andreessen seriously; we thought it was only a metaphor. Now we face the challenge of extracting the world from the jaws of Internet platform monopolies.

I used to be a technology optimist. During a 35-year career investing in the best and brightest of Silicon Valley, I was lucky enough to be part of the personal computer, mobile communications, Internet, and social networking industries. Among the highlights of my career were early investments in Google and Amazon, and being a mentor to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg from 2006 to 2010.

Each new wave of technology increased productivity and access to knowledge. Each new platform was easier to use and more convenient. Technology powered globalisation and economic growth. For decades, it made the world a better place. We assumed it always would.

Then came 2016, when the Internet revealed two dark sides. One is related to individual users. Smartphones with LTE mobile infrastructure created the first content-delivery platform that was available every waking moment, transforming the technology industry and the lives of two billion users. With little or no regulatory supervision in most of the world, companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, and Tencent used techniques common in propaganda and casino gambling, such as constant notifications and variable rewards, to foster psychological addiction.

The other dark side is geopolitical. In the United States, Western Europe, and Asia, Internet platforms, especially Facebook, enable the powerful to inflict harm on the powerless in politics, foreign policy, and commerce. Elections across Europe and in the US have repeatedly demonstrated that automated social networks can be exploited to undermine democracy.

The Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016 also revealed that Facebook provides significant relative advantages to negative messages over positive ones. Authoritarian governments can use Facebook to promote public support for repressive policies, as may be occurring now in Myanmar, Cambodia, the Philippines, and elsewhere. In some cases, Facebook actually provides support to such governments, as it does to all large clients.

I am confident that the founders of Facebook, Google, and other major Internet platforms did not intend to cause harm when they adopted their business models. They were young entrepreneurs, hungry for success. They spent years building huge audiences by reorganising the online world around a set of applications that were more personalised, convenient, and easier to use than their predecessors. And they made no attempt to monetise their efforts until long after users were hooked. The advertising business models they chose were leveraged by personalisation, which enabled advertisers to target their messages with unprecedented precision.

But then came the smartphone, which transformed all media and effectively put Facebook, Google, and a handful of others in control of the information flow to users. The filters that give users “what they want” had the effect of polarising populations and eroding the legitimacy of fundamental democratic institutions (most notably, the free press). And the automation that made Internet platforms so profitable left them vulnerable to manipulation by malign actors everywhere – and not just authoritarian governments hostile to democracy.

As Andreessen warned us, these companies, with their global ambition and reach, are eating the world economy. In the process, they are adopting versions of Facebook’s corporate philosophy — “move fast and break things” — without regard for the impact on people, institutions, and democracy. A large minority of citizens in the developed world inhabits filter bubbles created by these platforms — digital false realities in which existing beliefs become more rigid and extreme.

In the US, approximately one-third of the adult population has become impervious to new ideas, including demonstrable facts. Such people are easy to manipulate, a concept that former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris calls “brain hacking”.

Western democracies are unprepared to deal with this threat. The US has no effective regulatory framework for Internet platforms, and lacks the political will to create one. The European Union has both a regulatory framework and the necessary political will, but neither is adequate to the challenge. The EU’s recent judgment against Google — a record $2.7 billion fine for anti-competitive behaviour — was well conceived, but undersized. Google appealed, and its investors shrugged. It may be a good start, but it was clearly insufficient.

We are at a critical juncture. Awareness of the risks posed by Internet platforms is growing from a small base, but the convenience of the products and psychological addiction to them are such that it may take a generation to effect change from the user side, as it did with anti-smoking campaigns. Recognition of the corrosive effect of platform monopolies on competition and innovation is greater in Europe than in the US, but no one has found an effective regulatory strategy. Awareness that the platforms can be manipulated to undermine democracy is also growing, but Western governments have yet to devise a defence against it.

The challenges posed by Internet platform monopolies require new approaches beyond antitrust enforcement. We must recognise and address these challenges as a threat to public health. One possibility is to treat social media in a manner analogous to tobacco and alcohol, combining education and regulation.

For the sake of restoring balance to our lives and hope to our politics, it is time to disrupt the disrupters.

Google Doodle celebrates 104th birth anniversary of India’s lens lady Homai Vyarawalla,https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/google-doodle-celebrates-104th-birth-anniversary-of-india-s-lens-lady-homai-vyarawalla/story-BgvKHOBHT8qApz5PgyeerJ.html,"Sat, 09 Dec 2017 09:30:02 GMT","On the 104th birth anniversary of India’s first woman photojournalist, Google pays tribute to Homai Vyarawalla with a Doodle.

Born in a Parsi family in Gujarat’s Navsari in 1913, Vyarawalla gained fame in the then male-dominated field of photojournalism. She carved a niche in photojournalism even as she wore a sari and carried her equipment bags on her shoulders.

Vyarawalla’s father was an actor in an Urdu-Parsi travelling theatre company. As his job required a lot of travelling, Vyarawalla got an opportunity to accompany him.

Her family eventually settled in Mumbai, then Bombay, where Vyarawalla pursued her passion for photography and enrolled herself in the Sir J. J. School of Art. It was there that she met Maneckshaw Vyarawalla, a photojournalist himself and Vyarawalla’s future husband.

Vyarawalla got a job with the British Information Services in New Delhi in 1942. It gave her the opportunity to photograph some of the prominent leaders of the Independence movement, which was at its peak.

In many interviews Vyarawalla gave she said that prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru was her favourite subject. She considered Nehru as the most photogenic faces she had captured during her professional years. One of her memorable shots of Nehru was the one in which he was warmly receiving his sister Vijayalakshami Pandit at the Delhi airport. This was one of the many photographs she took of Nehru in her decades-long career.

Vyarawalla’s photograph of the first flag hoisting ceremony at Red Fort on August 16, 1947 is iconic. Apart from that, the departure of Lord Mountbatten from India and the funerals of Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri were some of the other photographs that are highlights in her career. Her work brings alive the euphoria and the struggle for independence.

In 1969, Vyarawalla’s husband Maneckshaw passed away. His passing away broke her to the point of ending her illustrious career. Years later she moved to Pilani to live with her son Farouq.

Her contribution to photojournalism earned her a Padma Vibhushan, India’s second highest civilian honour.

On 15 January 2012, her inspiring journey came to an end at the age of 98. She bequeath her life’s work to the New Delhi-based Alkazi Foundation for the Arts for documentation.","On the 104th birth anniversary of India’s first woman photojournalist, Google pays tribute to Homai Vyarawalla with a Doodle.

5 cool Google Chrome hacks that you didn’t know existed,https://www.hindustantimes.com/5-cool-google-chrome-hacks-that-you-didn-t-know-existed/story-1GKP82m83aTCgSACPCgQTO.html,"Sat, 11 Nov 2017 12:06:25 GMT","If there is one thing that we cannot do without in the office, it is Google Chrome. One of the most used browser in the world, it’s simplicity and ease of operation play a key role in making it popular. However, did you know that Google Chrome offers more than just a browsing experience? Well, then check out these easy tips and hacks that will optimize your browsing experience.

1) Customizing and managing your Chrome profiles

One of the most useful features about using Chrome is that you can create your own login and profile so that Chrome can store information such as browsing history, bookmarks etc. However, did you know you can create multiple profiles? For example, you can have a work profile to use Chrome while in office. Chrome keeps information such saved passwords and login- separate for each profile. Go to settings and select ‘manage people’. Then, select ‘add other people’. Now, you can create alternate profiles for yourself for different purposes and customize them as per your needs. This allows you to use two or more profiles on the same system.

2)Recovering forgotten passwords

Since we use so many apps and websites, remembering passwords can be tricky. Sooner or later, we tend to forget our password. However, with this Chrome hack, you can easily recover forgotten passwords. Go to ‘settings’, scroll down and select ‘advance’. Then, select ‘manage passwords’ and you can see the list of passwords and information saved in alphabetical order. If your Gmail is synced, then select ‘passwords.google.com’ and you can recover any forgotten credentials.

3)Reopen closed tabs

At times, we accidently end up closing all the tabs opened inChrome or our system just crashes while browsing. In the process, we lose track of all the websites that we were browsing. However, with this hack, you can open all the closed tabs in one go. Use ‘Ctrl+ shift + R’ to reopen all the closed tabs.

4)Bookmarking all tabs in one go

Sometimes, we want to bookmark websites that we think we would need to revisit. To save time from bookmarking each website one by one, you can use this hack to bookmark various websites at one go. Use Ctrl+ Shift + D to bookmark multiple sites.

5)Getting rid of ads and pop-ups

The most annoying thing about browsing is that you have to deal with annoying ads and pop-up on a regular basis. To get rid of these ads and pop-ups, go to more tools and select extensions. Then, search for ad-blocker and install it. This extension will help you block any ads and pop-ups.","If there is one thing that we cannot do without in the office, it is Google Chrome.

"Apple iPhone X: How Face ID works, how to set it up and more",https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/apple-iphone-x-how-face-id-works-how-to-set-it-up-and-more/story-uqdebkChoWcSH5MmCqGBEL.html,"Sun, 05 Nov 2017 06:26:41 GMT","The much-awaited iPhone X is finally here. The smartphone that marks 10th anniversary of the iPhone comes with unique design, edge-to-edge screen and customised version of iOS. The most critical change, however, is the inclusion of Face ID, which replaces the fingerprint scanner-based Touch ID.

So, you might be wondering how does one get used to Face ID? How does it work? Is it convenient and safe? Well, we have been using the iPhone X for last few days here’s how Apple’s futuristic Face ID works.

What’s Face ID?

Let’s begin with a very basic question. After all, what is Face ID? Well, it’s essentially a new technique of authenticating user profile to log into the smartphone. While Touch ID scanned your fingerprint, Face ID, as the name implies, scans your face in 360-degree for a 3D map.

Technology behind Face ID

Apple has a dedicated setup of sensors, called TrueDepth camera, which facilitate Face ID. These sensors including infrared camera, dot projector, front camera and flood illuminator, are placed on the front-notch on the iPhone X. The TrueDepth camera uses infrared wavelength (invisible to the naked eye) to accurately capture your facial details. This allows the camera to unlock your phone even in low light and dark conditions.

“The TrueDepth camera captures accurate face data by projecting and analyzing over 30,000 invisible dots to create a depth map of your face and also captures an infrared image of your face,” Apple explains on its website.

“A portion of the A11 Bionic chip’s neural engine — protected within the Secure Enclave — transforms the depth map and infrared image into a mathematical representation and compares that representation to the enrolled facial data.”

How to Set up Face ID?

Setting up Face ID on the iPhone X is a bit awkward. Before beginning the setup, ensure the front camera lens isn’t covered or there’s any obstruction between your face and the front camera. The distance between the phone and your face ideally should be about a feet, though Apple says Face ID works best when the device is about an arm’s length or closer.

Step 1: To get started, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode (Ensure you’ve already created a passcode for the phone or create one)

Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID and place the phone in front of your face. You will see a circular frame on the screen.

Step 3: Move/adjust your position to fit in that circular frame.

Step 4: Slowly move your head in clockwise direction.

Step 5: Repeat the process for the final verification. Once the set up is complete, tap Done.

What things can you do with Face ID?

Besides logging into your iPhone X, you can Face ID to authenticate downloads on iTunes and App Store, pretty much everything that Touch ID does. You can also use Face ID to autofill usernames and passwords for compatible websites in Safari. You can also sign in to app using this feature. Face ID is also compatible with Apple Pay, though this feature is not available in India.

Unlock your phone with just a glance. (Apple)

Face ID and user privacy

Apple gives a lot of importance to user privacy. For Face ID, the company says the data collected by facial identification method is encrypted and “never leaves your device and is never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else.” Apple adds that the apps cannot access Face ID data associated with the registered face.

“Within supported apps, you can enable Face ID for authentication. Apps are only notified as to whether the authentication is successful.

Users have control over how to use Face ID. One can disable Face ID by opening Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Use Face ID for and disable iPhone unlock. You can also disable Face ID for other functionalities.

Is it convenient?

Getting used to Face ID takes a bit of time, but not that long as you’d expect. Unlike the iris scanner on the Galaxy Note 8, Face ID doesn’t fire your front camera on the screen. Everything that Face ID does is invisible to the human eye.

Also, it doesn’t really compel you to hold your phone in front of your face all the times; rather it focuses on your attention (Attention-aware in Applespeak).The good thing is that it works from almost all angles and unlocks the phone with ease. It works even if you are wearing glasses or changed your look a bit. There’s a minute bit of struggle when using in low light, but works properly nonetheless.","Well, we have been using the iPhone X for last few days here’s how Apple’s futuristic Face ID works.

A lot of users are still complaining about a variety of issues, including battery drain and slow performance. While Apple is still working to fix the reported bugs, a new issue in iOS 11 has grabbed wide attention.

If you try to enter numbers in rapid succession for a calculation within the native Calculator app, it will show you an incorrect result. For example, a simple addition of 1+2+3 will show 24 instead of 6. Spotted by a user on Reddit, the calculation shows incorrect answers when entering numbers in rapid succession.

Open the iOS 11 calculator. Rapidly type 1 + 2 + 3. Odds are you won’t get 6…

😳😳😳 — Prof Chris Oliver (@CyclingSurgeon) October 23, 2017

According to MacRumors, the bug had been prevalent throughout iOS 11 beta testing, but gained a wide attention just last week. “Any iOS developers will see what is wrong here: the bug is that the animation that lights up the button is blocking touch events until the animation completes. This is the default behavior for animations, but to make an app feel responsive it’s best to find a way around that (it can be a one line fix, but sometimes it is complicated),” said a user on Reddit.

The website says the animation lag within the redesigned Calculator app causes some symbols to be missed, thus yielding a wrong result.

Fortunately, Apple has fixed the issue in its latest iOS 11.2 beta version which was released to developers on Monday. If you’re also facing the same bug, you may want to download third-party calculator apps such as Calcbot.

It seems Apple will be rolling out major fixes in its next big software update, iOS 11.1. Anticipated to be rolled out very soon, the update is also expected to bring performance improvements and fixes for Wi-Fi and battery drain.

The last minor update released earlier this month aimed to fix non-responsive audio and haptic feedback on some iPhone 7.","Apple’s latest operating system iteration, iOS 11, hasn’t really seen a smooth rollout.

Going forward, the search engine giant will use location data of users to serve the results.

This essentially means whether you switch to google.co.uk or google.co.in, search results won’t change and will be based on your location.

“So if you live in Australia, you’ll automatically receive the country service for Australia, but when you travel to New Zealand, your results will switch automatically to the country service for New Zealand.

“It’s important to note that while this update will change the way Google Search and Maps services are labeled, it won’t affect the way these products work, nor will it change how we handle obligations under national law.”

Google further said that the update will help users receive the most relevant results that have been tailored based on their location. This will also help deliver a consistency among all Google services including Gmail, YouTube and Google Maps.

The latest change to Google search appears to be based on rising app-culture and mobile internet usage, which generally relies on users’ location.

Called the Karbonn A40, the smartphone is available for an “effective price” of Rs 1,399. The market price of the phone is Rs 3,499.

Fine prints

Just like the JioPhone, a customer needs to make a down payment of Rs 2,899 for the 4G smartphone. The customer needs to make monthly recharges of Rs 169 for continuous 36 months.

The customer will get a cash refund of Rs 500 after 18 months and another Rs 1000 after 36 months, taking the total cash benefit to Rs 1500.

“In case the customer does not wish to opt for the Rs 169 bundled plan, she/he has the flexibility of doing recharges of any denomination and validity as per individual requirements. However, to claim the cash refund benefit, recharges worth Rs 3000 must be done within the first 18 months (to claim the first refund installment of Rs 500) and another Rs 3000 over the next 18 months (to claim the second refund installment of Rs 1000)”, said the company in a release.

Note that the customer doesn’t need to return the device to Airtel or Karbonn at any point to claim the cash benefit.

After sales support for the devices will be provided by the handset manufacturers through their service network, said the company.

Karbonn A40: Specifications, features

The smartphone comes with a 4-inch display. It runs on Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box and is powered by a 1.3Ghz processor coupled with 1GB of RAM.

The Karbonn A40 sports a 2-megapixel rear camera and 0.3-megapixel front-facing camera. Other key features of the smartphone include 4G, VoLTE, Bluetooth and GPS.

How’s it different from the Reliance JioPhone

The Reliance JioPhone is essentially a smartphone in a feature phone form factor. The JioPhone is locked to Reliance’s ecosystem, which means you rely on Jio apps such as JioTV and JioVoice and so on. Also, you miss out on key apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook. Since the Karbonn A40 is an Android phone, you get access to all the popular apps including Google’s suite of apps such as Gmail, Google Maps, and so on.

More low-cost 4G VoLTE smartphones coming soon

Airtel says that it will be partnering with multiple mobile handset manufacturers to launch more affordable 4G phones at low prices, and match the price of a feature phone.

“The partnership between Airtel and Karbonn is part of Airtel’s ‘Mera Pehla 4G Smartphone’ initiative, which is aimed at enabling every Indian to buy a 4G smartphone and get on to the digital superhighway,” the company added.

State-run telecom operator BSNL earlier this week revealed plans to partner with handset companies to launch affordable phones bundled with data benefits from the telco.","In a bid to compete with Reliance Jio’s, rival Bharti Airtel on Wednesday announced the launch of a new smartphone in partnership with Karbonn Mobiles.

Researchers found that living abroad increases “self-concept clarity,” the extent to which individuals’ beliefs about themselves are clearly and confidently defined and consistent and stable over time.

They conducted six studies involving 1,874 participants from online panels and international MBA programmes, who then completed surveys on living abroad. Researchers from Columbia University and Rice University in the US found living abroad triggers self-discerning reflections in which people grapple with different cultural values and norms of their home and host cultures.

These reflections are helpful in discovering which values and norms define who people are and which simply reflect their cultural upbringing, according to the study.

The study found that depth (the length of time lived abroad) rather than breadth (the number of countries lived in) enhances a clear sense of self. The longer people live abroad, the more self-discerning reflections they accumulate.

“Our studies demonstrate that living abroad affects the fundamental structure of the self-concept by enhancing its clarity,” researchers wrote in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes.

While most research on foreign experiences has focused on whether people have lived abroad or not, the study takes a more nuanced approach to distinguish between the depth and the breadth of international experiences.

It found that depth (the length of time lived abroad) rather than breadth (the number of foreign countries lived in) enhances a clear sense of self. The longer people live abroad, the more self-discerning reflections they accumulate, the researchers said.

As a result, the more likely they are to develop a better understanding of themselves and have increased clarity about career decision-making, they said. Understanding the impact of living abroad has practical implications for organisations as they operate across national borders and recruit foreign talent, the study found.

"Words of encouragement, praise can help motivate autistic adults to exercise more",https://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/words-of-encouragement-praise-can-help-motivate-autistic-adults-to-exercise-more/story-TABDAMVLLaQdclc371IlXI.html,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 08:48:52 GMT","Praise may motivate young adults with autism to exercise more, according to a study. The research from the UNC Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute (FPG) also found that praising people with autism by pre-recorded messages through iPhones and iPods shows promise for producing more exercise.

“As people with autism age, they tend to exercise less and less than their peers without autism,” said FPG’s Melissa N. Savage, who headed the study. “Previous studies have shown that individuals with autism are at special risk for health challenges like obesity, as well as for secondary conditions like depression and diabetes.”

Savage said that in addition to health benefits that regular physical activity carries for everyone, it also can be especially powerful for people with autism. “Prior research has demonstrated that regular moderate-to-vigorous exercise for people with autism can increase their academic engagement in the classroom,” she explained. “They tend to spend more time on task and display fewer challenging behaviours.”

Due to the benefits of regular physical activity for people with autism, Savage wanted to explore how to increase their engagement in a regular exercise routine through positive reinforcement, a well-established practice for use with people with autism.

“With technology use in physical activity becoming more commonplace, it was important to determine its advantages or disadvantages to provide needed support,” Savage said. “We wanted to know under which condition participants would engage in more aerobic activity and which condition they preferred.”

For this small single-subject design study, she implemented an exercise program for three young adults with autism, ages 20-22, and followed their daily progress through multiple sessions under different conditions.

While participants were running laps around cones, they heard the same voice either in-person or through headphones on a fixed schedule, delivering various praise statements, such as “Good job running around the cones!” or “You are doing a great job running Mason!” These praise statements incorporated the target behavior (running), which the autism team’s AFIRM online instruction highlights as an important feature of effective reinforcement.

“We found that introducing praise statements corresponded with more physical activity for all participants,” Savage said. “The number of laps increased for all of them, regardless of whether they received praise in person or through technology.”

According to Savage, though, the impact of praise on exercise may not have been the most important finding. “When it comes to motivating young adults with autism to exercise, part of the solution may lie in making use of technology,” she said. “Participants who excelled when hearing praise statements through technology also maintained their performances even when we thinned out the praise statements and generalized the exercise to a new setting.”

Savage also said that using technology has several additional advantages. Especially among young adults, cell phones and iPods are popular and carry no stigma. Using them for support may also help people with autism feel more independent.

Relying on technology to deliver praise statements or provide other support also saves time. “In-person praise required much more attention to the participant during intervention, and it was harder to be consistent with the time-based schedule,” she said. “Using the mobile devices required about 5 minutes to record and upload the praise statements, but there wasn’t any additional work needed once that was done.”

You should include more beetroot in your diet. It helps treat Alzheimer’s,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/you-should-include-more-beetroot-in-your-diet-it-helps-treat-alzheimer-s/story-D0hsSUcVFIgwgQNfaZnlwI.html,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 08:23:03 GMT","A compound in beet plant that gives the vegetable its distinctive red colour may help slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, a study claims. Researchers at the University of South Florida in the US found that the compound could slow the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain, a process associated with Alzheimer’s.

The discovery could lead to the development of drugs that may alleviate some of the long-term effects of the disease, the world’s leading cause of dementia, researchers said. “Our data suggest that betanin, a compound in beet extract, shows some promise as an inhibitor of certain chemical reactions in the brain that are involved in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease,” said Li-June Ming from University of South Florida.

“This is just a first step, but we hope that our findings will encourage other scientists to look for structures similar to betanin that could be used to synthesise drugs that could make life a bit easier for those who suffer from this disease,” said Ming, who presented the research at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS).

Previous research conducted by other scientists suggests that beetroot juice can improve oxygen flow to the ageing brain and possibly improve cognitive performance. (Shutterstock)

Scientists are still trying to figure out what causes this progressive and irreversible brain disorder. However, one prime suspect is beta-amyloid, a sticky protein fragment, or peptide, that accumulates in the brain, disrupting communication between brain cells called neurons. Much of this damage occurs, Ming said, when beta-amyloid attaches itself to metals such as iron or copper. These metals can cause beta-amyloid peptides to misfold and bind together in clumps that can promote inflammation and oxidation - a process similar to rusting - in nearby neurons, eventually killing them.

Previous research conducted by other scientists suggests that beetroot juice can improve oxygen flow to the ageing brain and possibly improve cognitive performance. Ming and colleagues wanted to find out if betanin, a beet compound used in commercial dyes that readily binds to metals, could block the effects of copper on beta-amyloid and, in turn, prevent the misfolding of these peptides and the oxidation of neurons. They conducted a series of experiments involving 3,5 di-tert-butylcatechol, or DTBC. The scientists measured the oxidative reaction of DTBC when exposed to beta-amyloid only, beta-amyloid bound to copper, and copper-bound beta-amyloid in a mixture containing betanin. On its own, beta-amyloid caused little or no oxidation of DTBC, researchers said.

However, as expected, beta-amyloid bound to copper induced substantial DTBC oxidation. When betanin was added to the copper-bound beta-amyloid mixture, the researchers found oxidation dropped by as much as 90 per cent, suggesting that misfolding of the peptides was potentially suppressed.

Being obese may rob your tongue of taste buds. Here’s what happens,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/being-obese-may-rob-your-tongue-of-taste-buds-here-s-what-happens/story-apDTrtJgUfYp8gmLh8IALN.html,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 07:47:15 GMT","Packing on pounds seems to dull people’s sense of taste, and puzzled researchers turned to mice to figure out why: Obesity, they found, can rob the tongue of taste buds.

If Tuesday’s findings pan out, “this could be a whole new kind of target in treating obesity,” said Cornell University food scientist Robin Dando, whose lab led the research. “People don’t really look at the taste bud, but it’s so fundamental.”

Diet, exercise and genetics are among many factors that play a role in obesity. But taste preferences influence dietary choices, and some earlier studies have suggested that obese people often taste flavours with less intensity than lean people. The theory, still unproven, is that people might make up for weakened taste by turning to higher-calorie foods or generally eating more.

Diet, exercise and genetics are among many factors that play a role in obesity. But taste preferences influence dietary choices, and some earlier studies have suggested that obese people often taste flavours with less intensity than lean people.

Dando’s team took a closer look at taste buds, those clusters of cells on the tongue that help perceive the five tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami.

They turned to lab mice, feeding them a high-fat diet that caused rapid weight gain — and then counting the taste buds in a spot on the tongue that’s normally packed with them.

The obese mice wound up with 25% fewer taste buds than lean mice that were fed a normal diet, the researchers reported in the journal PLOS Biology.

Taste buds constantly regenerate as the 50 to 100 cells inside them mature, die off and are replaced by new ones. Taste bud cells have an average lifespan of about 10 days, and turnover of the entire taste bud takes about four weeks, explained Dando, who directs the Cornell Sensory Evaluation Facility. Both sides of that cycle were affected in the obese mice, as regular cell death sped up and resupply dropped.

Could fatty food be responsible? No, the researchers found mice genetically resistant to obesity chowed down yet didn’t lose taste buds.

The remaining suspect: the chronic inflammation that obesity triggers throughout the body. Dando’s team examined a common inflammatory molecule called TNF-alpha. Mice bred to be genetically incapable of making that molecule got fat but also didn’t lose taste buds. But injecting that molecule directly into the tongues of lean mice resulted in faster die-off of taste bud cells, the researchers reported.

The study “does underscore the relationship between taste sensitivity and weight,” said Dr. John Morton, a Stanford University bariatric surgeon who wasn’t involved in the new work. “It’s another reason why it’s hard to lose weight.”

Several years ago, Morton gave his own patients taste tests before and after stomach-shrinking surgery, and found taste perception improved as the pounds dropped.

Whatever the role of taste buds, Morton advises patients to eat mindfully – appreciating the sight and smell, and slowing down to chew 30 times before they swallow. “You get satisfaction from food in ways other than volume,” he said.

World Down Syndrome Day: 10 things to know about the disease,https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/world-down-syndrome-day-10-things-to-know-about-the-disease/story-IKSsPm1GT81cvhQJyYr1rK.html,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 03:48:45 GMT","In 2012, the United Nations first observed World Down Syndrome Day, to raise awareness about the disease. Down Syndrome (DS), is also called as Trisomy 21, and is a common genetic birth disorder where extra genetic material causes delays in the child’s mental and physical development. While each cell in the human body contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, individuals with Down syndrome, have an extra 21st chromosome.

Dr Kushagradhi Ghosh, Bhagirathi Neotia Women and Child Care Center, Kolkata, shares some inputs about the condition:

* In India, the incidence of chromosomal disorders is 1:166 live births (Source: The Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology of India).

* With India being one of the highest birthing nations, there is greater incidence of Down Syndrome and it occurs in approximately 1 out of 830 live births, as per Down Syndrome Federation of India.

* Down Syndrome is associated with mild to moderate learning disabilities, growth milestone delays, certain facial features and low muscle tone in early infancy.

* There is no exact reason known for the occurrence of Down Syndrome but it can be, at times, attributed to the age of the mother and if there is a family history of the disease.

* While there are no symptoms that a mother experiences during pregnancy, a series of screenings and tests can help detect Down Syndrome before birth.

* Women above 35 years of age can be at a higher risk of giving birth to a baby with Down Syndrome.

* The most common features associated with babies born with Down Syndrome include facial features that are flat, a small head and ears, abnormally shaped ears and slanting upward eyes, short fingers, and enlarged tongue.

* People with Down Syndrome are more prone to various infections due to low resistance. Many individuals with Down Syndrome go on to develop heart defects, leukemia, early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, gastro-intestinal problems, and other health issues (Down Syndrome Federation of India).

* There are no set treatments for Down Syndrome, but it can be addressed through a wide variety of educational and support programs that can help the child and the families concerned. Counselling sessions help families to help children with their social skills, motor movements, language and cognitive skills. There are also schools that help children with Down Syndrome to socialise and develop important life skills.

* Reports suggest that the life expectancy of kids with Down Syndrome has reached an average of 50-60 years.

"Smile, travel, be helpful: The secret to happiness is not outside, but within you",https://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/smile-travel-be-helpful-the-secret-to-happiness-is-not-outside-but-within-you/story-tb20XWTp8iZ1xmkgGRGr6O.html,"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:30:59 GMT","To truly mark occasion of International Day of Happiness, it is important to realise and introspect that achieving happiness is the essence of everyday lives. Happiness is not the enigma as it has been led to assume. Whether it’s the joy in little things or the prosperity at achieving certain aspects in your life, it is difficult to put a quantum to the happiness.

Here are some secrets to achieve that complacent happiness which we all aim for but are not sure how to achieve:

- Identify ‘whatever floats your boat’

The biggest task is to figure out how is the concept of happiness perceived in your mind. Happiness doesn’t mean being cheerful and chirpy all the time. “Don’t focus on ‘happiness’. Most of us won’t ever feel constantly ‘happy’ in the way that we are traditionally sold the idea - rather, chase ‘wholeness’,” said Laura Jane Williams, author of ‘Ice Cream for Breakfast’, as quoted by The Independent.

“Wholeness is to know that life is a million shades of grey - contentedness, sadness, ecstasy, melancholy - and that they all count. All of our emotions matter, not just the ‘good’ ones.”

- Connecting is the key

While being able to enjoy your own company is great, cherishing human connection is vital to happiness too.

- Break your way

Moving at a rapid pace to cope up with life has taken over everyone’s mind, which in turn has blocked the path to happiness. Break your way should be the mantra in such situations - Taking a pause once in a while and having an introspective look at your self is something which is required for a healthy contentment in life.

- Love your body

Even though it comes as no brainer but exercising and loving your body can do wonders for your mood and building up your self-worth.

Instead of just focusing on your physical appearance, nutritionist Farah Fonseca, titled England’s Strongest Woman twice, said, “Exercise can be fabulous for your mental health and happiness as well. Exercise builds more than muscle - it also boosts self-confidence, mental agility and a ‘can-do’ attitude.”

- Focusing on yourself

We all have a tendency to compare ourselves to others, which inevitably fosters feelings of ineptitude and low self-esteem. However, once you stop caring about what other people thing about you will transform your life for good.

- Being helpful

Lending a helping hand to someone in need or simply acting in a more thoughtful manner will create a positive atmosphere that all can benefit from, whether you’re the giver or the receiver. You never know how much of an impact a small act of kindness can do.

- Find your silver lining

No matter what situation you find yourself in, no matter how dire it may seem, a silver lining can always be found. Every experience is a lesson in disguise, and realising that is extremely liberating.

- Change of scenery

Beautiful landscapes and serene surroundings impact your mood to an extent unbelievable. While some people treat is as an opportunity to reconnect with your mind and soul, it actually induces a serenity that makes your happier in the long run.

- A smile says a million words

A smiling face induces happiness in others - while the tip is not new but the truth behind these words is often not perceived to its fullest. Not only can smiling lower your stress levels and have a positive effect overall health, but it’s also a powerful tool that you can use to connect with others.","To truly mark occasion of International Day of Happiness, it is important to realise and introspect that achieving happiness is the essence of everyday lives.

The drip of beauty: Should you opt for vitamins through IV?,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/the-drip-of-beauty-should-you-opt-for-vitamins-through-iv/story-5Hp62nwQLJaWbKOhYtnrWK.html,"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:24:09 GMT","Since the last few years, several celebrities have opted for hydration therapy also known as the IV drip vitamin therapy. Some of its hardcore patrons include singers Rihanna, Adele, model Chrissy Teigen and reality star Khloé Kardashian. This is a therapy in which multiple vitamins and antioxidants are administered intravenously and it is touted as a quick fix for multiple lifestyle issues such as dull skin, exhaustion, hangover, jet lag, etc.

However, reportedly, Kendall Jenner ran into complications after an IV drip session — held just before the Oscar night — went awry. This has made everyone sit up and question not only the safety of these procedures but also their validity.

How it all began

The trend began after a “collateral effect” experienced by patients who were being treated for liver failure. Dr Rinky Kapoor, dermatologist and skin laser specialist, SL Raheja Fortis Hospital, Mahim, explains, “Those patients who were injected with high doses of the master antioxidants, in particular, glutathione and vitamin C, exhibited changes in the skin. Their hyperpigmentation cleared and there was a general improvement in the skin texture and appearance.”

Several injectable combinations of antioxidants and vitamins are now doing the rounds in the market, in any and every dose. All experts agree that none of them were approved by FDA to this date for aesthetic purposes.

Ideal cause for an IV drip

Drips are recommended if the benefits outweigh the risks in case of limited options in treating a skin problem, or in cases of genuine deficiency. When and if medically required, it is an efficient way to hydrate patients and administer essential nutrients.

According to Dr Saurabh Shah, dermatologist, Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, mostly IV drip is given to patients who have “acute and chronic illness”, those low on minerals and nutrients, and have chronic fatigue syndrome.

Dr Sujit Shanshanwal, dermatologist, Apollo Clinic, echoes the same thoughts. He says, “Vitamin drips should ideally be used when there is a need for it and it would be best assessed by testing the blood levels of the suspected deficiencies and then supplementing them as needed. Blindly pumping your body with things that are not needed is never a good idea.”

The fad of ‘gluta’ shots

A popular trend these days is the glutathione drip aka gluta shots. Glutathione is supposed to be the mother of all antioxidants and gives the skin a glow. Therefore, almost all the celebrities opt for this drip.

“This is FDA approved for patients with liver diseases and hence a controversial topic (for beauty treatments),” says Dr Shah, adding, “There are cases of thrombophlebitis at the site of injection especially in men and women who are smokers and alcoholic.”

Famous fake promises

Most people in metro cities are fatigued and ill-nourished due to their erratic lifestyle and eating habits. The fact that an intravenous replacement can cure this instantly is catchy for those running against the clock. Therefore, they opt for this quick-fix instead of investing long-term in diet and exercise.

“Words like detoxifying, skin glow, instant rejuvenation, immune boost, etc. are immensely attractive. Anything that promises these is taken up by the masses without giving it a second thought about the genuineness of the product, and the science backing the results. Sellers ar making the most of this human instinct,” says Dr Kapoor.

She further adds, “One must especially beware of medical spas and quacks offering intravenous therapies in ‘hangover clinics’, where promised immediate relief from the symptoms of a hangover (tiredness, headache, nausea) and hooked up to a drip of fluids and medication, with the idea of immediate recovery. A cocktail of vitamins like this can risk reaching toxic levels.”

As per Dr Kiran Naik, plastic and cosmetic surgeon, Global Hospitals, Parel, following are the probable side effects of IV drips for aesthetic purposes:

Bruising, infection and painful swelling at the IV site

Excessive vitamin B can cause liver damage

Glutathione can cause patchy skin

With multiple drugs in the same IV, there can be drug interactions

Rarely, may cause a life-threatening allergic condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

The takeaway

The human body has a systematic way of functioning. When it receives a high amount of vitamins or minerals in a single dose, it filters out the majority of them via kidneys or liver. That is because they can’t be stored in the body for use at a later time. So unless one has a medical deficiency, it logically does not justify the fact that these IV drips are beneficial.

“The benefits being observed by those propagating it or receiving it may be peer-driven or psychological. There are studies going on across the world on some of these molecules, and until a documented, placebo-controlled, proven study establishes the results and side effects scientifically, they are being taken at the patient’s own risk,” says Dr Kapoor.

The compound, semaglutide, has a chemical structure that is very similar to the hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which regulates both insulin secretion and appetite. In December, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the semaglutide injection Ozempic as a once-weekly adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.

“This randomised study of weight loss induced with semaglutide in people with obesity but without diabetes has shown the highest weight reductions yet seen for any pharmaceutical intervention,” said lead author Patrick M O’Neil of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, SC.

The new study included 957 participants, 35% of whom were male. All participants had a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30, but did not have diabetes. They were randomly assigned to seven different groups. Five groups received different doses of semaglutide (between 0.05 mg and 0.4 mg) via injection once daily; a sixth group received a placebo, and a seventh group received 3 mg of the diabetes drug liraglutide. All participants received monthly diet and exercise counselling.

After one year, all participants receiving semaglutide had lost significantly more weight than those receiving placebo. The higher the dose participants received, the greater their average weight loss. Participants who received 0.05 mg of semaglutide daily lost an average of 6.0% of their body weight; the 0.1 mg group lost an average of 8.6%; the 0.3 mg group lost an average of 11.2%; and those receiving a daily dose of 0.4 mg lost an average of 13.8%. Those receiving liraglutide lost an average of 7.8% of their body weight, while those in the placebo group lost only 2.3% on average.

Sixty five percent of participants who received 0.4 mg of semaglutide per day lost at least 10% of their body weight, compared with 10% of those in the placebo group and 34% of the liraglutide group. The most common adverse events in those taking semaglutide were mild/moderate nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

O’Neil noted that further studies of semaglutide for obesity are underway. The research was presented at ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society’s 100th annual meeting in Chicago, Ill.

Sleep-deprived men are at greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Here’s why,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/sleep-deprived-men-are-at-greater-risk-of-developing-type-2-diabetes-here-s-why/story-EoOuvPd820cXdIRAlpogrO.html,"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 06:09:03 GMT","There’s a link between insufficient sleep and the development of insulin resistance, one of the factors that cause Type 2 diabetes. A team of US researchers has discovered a biological reason for this relationship, at least in men: an imbalance between their testosterone and cortisol hormones.

“Our highly controlled sleep study showed that even one night of restricted sleep can cause insulin resistance and that we can dampen this effect by controlling levels of these two important hormones,” said senior investigator Peter Y. Liu of Los Angeles Biomedical (LA BioMed) Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, California.

Insulin resistance occurs when the body does not properly use the hormone insulin. Testosterone is the main anabolic, or muscle-building, hormone, whereas cortisol – often called the “stress hormone”– helps catabolism, or breaking down energy and fat stores for use, Liu explained. Past research shows that sleep loss reduces a man’s testosterone levels and increases cortisol levels.

Liu and his fellow researchers conducted five nights of sleep studies in 34 healthy men with an average age of 33. They controlled what the subjects ate and how much they slept, giving them 10 hours of sleep the first night and restricting them to four hours of sleep the remaining nights.

In this “crossover” study, the men served as their own controls. In one series of sleep studies, they received three medications: ketoconazole, which switches off the body’s production of testosterone and cortisol; testosterone gel; and oral hydrocortisone, a synthetic form of cortisol. The doses of testosterone and hydrocortisone were in the midrange of levels that the body normally produces, according to Liu. This arm of the study was called a dual “clamp” because it stopped the body’s production of these two hormones and then gave them a fixed amount of the hormones, thus clamping levels in a normal hormonal balance, he said.

In another set of experiments, the men received inactive placebos that matched the medications. The order of when they received the clamp and the placebo was random, with a two-week interval between the study conditions. The morning after the first and last nights of each part of the study, all men took the oral glucose tolerance test, in which they gave blood samples while fasting and again after drinking a sugary drink. This test result allowed the researchers to calculate each man’s insulin resistance using standard measures, including the Matsuda Index.

After sleep restriction, this index reportedly showed greater insulin resistance with both the clamp and the placebo. However, Liu said this increase was significantly dampened, or less severe, with the dual-clamp, demonstrating that testosterone and cortisol reduced the negative effects of sustained sleep restriction on insulin resistance.

“Maintaining hormonal balance could prevent metabolic ill health occurring in individuals who do not get enough sleep,” he said. “Understanding these hormonal mechanisms could lead to new treatments or strategies to prevent insulin resistance due to insufficient sleep.”

The study was presented at ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society’s 100th annual meeting in Chicago, Ill.

Breastfeeding can ward off childhood obesity",https://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/new-moms-take-note-breastfeeding-can-ward-off-childhood-obesity/story-GTLMuEOnleoqM1vL8GRQiM.html,"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 05:14:27 GMT","Turns out, warding off childhood obesity is as easy as feeding babies breast milk.

According to a recent study from the Ewha Womans University College of Medicine in Seoul, breastfeeding may protect high birth weight infants from being overweight or obese as children.

“High birth weight is associated with overweight or obesity during early childhood. Among high birth weight infants, exclusive breastfeeding is a significant protective factor against overweight and obesity,” said lead author Hae Soon Kim.

High birth weight infants were very likely to meet the criteria for obesity or overweight through six years of age compared with normal birth weight infants. But the risk of becoming overweight or obese dropped significantly among high birthweight infants who were breastfed for first six months of life,” Kim added.

The study showed that the risk of being overweight or obese decreased significantly if high birth weight infants were exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life.

In a retrospective cohort study, Kim and co-authors investigated the weight-growth trajectory and the protective effect of breastfeeding for obesity in children. They analysed data between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2016, from the National Health Information Database (NHID) of Korea.

The researchers followed 38,039 participants who were completely eligible for all health checkups from birth through six years of age. At each check-up period, the authors examined the association between birth weight status and growth development.

Infants were assigned to one of three groups by birth weight: the low birth weight group (less than or equal to 2,500 grams), the normal birth weight group (over 2,500 grams and under 4,000 grams), and the high birth weight group (4,000 grams or more).

During the follow-up period, about 10% of the low birth weight infants and 15% of the normal birth weight developed obesity or overweight. By contrast, more than 25% of the high birth weight infants met the criteria for obesity or overweight.

The high birth weight infants were highly likely to be overweight or have obesity compared with normal birth weight infants through six years of age, and the low birth weight infants were highly likely to be underweight through six years of age.

But the risk of being overweight or obese decreased significantly if high birth weight infants were exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life.

“The increase in the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity, which began in the 1970s, has grown into a global epidemic. Obesity persists from childhood to adolescence and into adulthood and is a leading cause of health problems,” the authors cautioned in their abstract.

The results were presented at ENDO 2018, the 100th annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in Chicago, Ill.

Want to lose weight?

“This study shows that, in obese insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients, a diet with three meals per day, consisting of a big breakfast, average lunch and small dinner, had many rapid and positive effects compared to the traditional diet with six small meals evenly distributed throughout the day: better weight loss, less hunger and better diabetes control while using less insulin,” said lead author Daniela Jakubowicz of the Tel Aviv University.

“The hour of the day — when you eat and how frequently you eat — is more important than what you eat and how many calories you eat,” she noted. “Our body metabolism changes throughout the day. A slice of bread consumed at breakfast leads to a lower glucose response and is less fattening than an identical slice of bread consumed in the evening.”

Jakubowicz and her colleagues studied 11 women and 18 men who had obesity and type 2 diabetes, being treated with insulin and averaged 69 years of age. The patients were randomly assigned to consume one of two different weight-loss diets, which contained an equal number of daily calories, for three months. One group (Bdiet) ate three meals: a large breakfast, a medium-sized lunch and a small dinner. The second group (6Mdiet) ate the traditional diet for diabetes and weight loss: six small meals evenly spaced throughout the day, including three snacks.

Overall glucose levels and glucose spikes were measured for 14 days at baseline, during the first two weeks on diet, and at the end of the study by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Glucose levels were tested every two weeks and insulin dosage was adjusted as needed. At three months, while the Bdiet group lost 5 kilograms (11 pounds) the 6Mdiet group gained 1.4 kg (3 lb).

Fasting glucose levels decreased 54 mg/dl (from 161 to 107) in the Bdiet group but only 23 mg/dl (from 164 to 141) in the 6Mdiet group. Overall mean glucose levels dropped in the first 14 days by 29 mg/dl (from 167 to 138 mg/dl) and 38 mg/dl (from 167 to 129 mg/dl) after three months in the Bdiet group. Overall mean glucose levels dropped only 9 mg/dl (from 171 to 162 mg/dl) in the first 14 days and only 17 mg/dl (from 171 to 154 mg/dl) in the 6Mdiet group.

Mean glucose levels during sleep dropped only in the Bdiet group, by 24 mg/dl (from 131 to 107), but not in the 6Mdiet group. The Bdiet group needed significantly less insulin (-20.5 units/day, from 54.7 to 34.8) while the 6Mdiet group needed more insulin (+2.2 units/day, from 67.8 to 70).

Carbohydrate craving and hunger decreased significantly in Bdiet group but increased in the 6Mdiet group. Importantly, the researchers found a significant reduction of overall glycemia after as little as 14 days on Bdiet, when the participant had almost the same weight as at baseline. This finding suggests that even before weight loss, the change in the meal timing itself has a quick beneficial effect on glucose balance that is further improved by the important weight loss found in the 3M diet.

“A diet with adequate meal timing and frequency has a pivotal role in glucose control and weight loss,” Jakubowicz observed. The study was presented at ENDO 2018, the 100th annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in Chicago, Ill.

Mothers who overeat during the period when they are breastfeeding may have children who are at increased risk of becoming obese and going through early puberty, a study on mice suggested. Early puberty may lead to increased risk of diabetes or reproductive problems later in life.

“Formula feeding is well known to increase the risk of obesity in children. Our findings suggest, however, that when breastfeeding mothers do not eat a moderate and healthy diet, there can also be increased risks of various health problems in the offspring, including obesity, diabetes, advanced puberty and reduced fertility,” said lead researcher Mengjie Wang of the University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences in Toledo, Ohio. “This idea must be tested in humans to know whether it applies to our species.” Previous studies have also shown that even bovine milk is not good for children as it has a high protein content called Casein, which is a heavy molecule for the baby to digest and causes an extra pressure on kidneys.

Wang noted that all over the world, puberty is starting earlier than it did in the past. “Childhood obesity, a common health issue, is one of the risk factors for early puberty,” she said. “Previous evidence from animals has revealed that post-weaning overeating advances the timing of puberty, but we lack knowledge of how nutrition before weaning influences metabolism and reproduction.”

To determine how excess body weight alters the timing of puberty, Wang gave mice a high-fat-diet from the date they gave birth and started breastfeeding until they weaned their pups. A second group of new mother mice was given a regular diet for the same amount of time. Wang found that overfeeding the mothers during breastfeeding can cause obesity in the pups and significantly advance the start of their puberty. “These results show that the breastfeeding phase is a critical window that influences when puberty happens,” Wang said.

Fertility tests of the mice in adulthood showed that those whose mothers had been fed a high-fat diet while breastfeeding had decreased litter size, longer duration from mating to date of birth and impaired pregnancy rate in both female and male mice. The researchers also found these mice suffered from glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity — signs of an increased risk of developing diabetes during adulthood.

“Our results reinforce the findings of previous studies that childhood obesity causes advanced puberty and metabolic disorders in adulthood,” Wang said. “Correct treatment and follow-up are both important for patients with early puberty. Patients with early puberty should be aware that other health problems may arise after they become adults.” The research was presented at ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society’s 100th annual meeting in Chicago.

“Our findings underscore the relationship between estrogen and disordered eating behavior, and the potential of estrogen replacement as a treatment target, not just in athletes, but potentially also in other conditions characterized by abnormal eating behavior and frequent menstrual dysfunction, such as anorexia nervosa,” she said.

Her study found that female athletes with exercise-induced irregular menstrual periods report more disordered eating behaviour than athletes and non-athletes getting regular periods. Misra compared 109 female athletes with exercise-induced menstrual irregularities with 50 female athletes with normal menstrual cycles and 39 female non-athletes. All of the study subjects were 14-25 years old and were in a normal weight range. The young women’s eating behavior and mental health was evaluated with self-report assessments and questionnaires.

Athletes with irregular periods reported a higher drive for thinness and more mental control over their food intake compared with athletes with regular periods and non-athletes. They also had higher mean body dissatisfaction scores than athletes with regular periods.

Athletes who had irregular menstrual periods were randomly assigned to receive either estrogen replacement through a patch, at a dose that resulted in estrogen levels seen with normal menstrual cycles; a commonly used combined oral contraceptive pill containing estrogen; or no estrogen for 12 months. Athletes randomized to estrogen replacement as a patch also received cyclic progesterone.

Over one year, the groups that received estrogen showed reductions in drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction and uncontrolled eating, compared with those who didn’t receive estrogen. The patch was the most effective, leading to significant decreases in body dissatisfaction and uncontrolled eating.","Young female athletes with normal weight and no or irregular menstrual periods reported fewer disordered eating behaviours after receiving estrogen therapy for a year, a recent study has found.

"Beware, these are the types of cancer where patients are at higher risk of committing suicide",https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/these-are-the-types-of-cancer-where-patients-are-at-higher-risk-of-committing-suicide/story-yCPwbndrewTGVf5QsixP5J.html,"Sun, 18 Mar 2018 06:53:48 GMT","Patients with prostate, bladder or kidney cancers are five times more likely to commit suicide, a survey led by an Indian-origin scientist has found. The analysis also showed that cancer patients are about three times more likely to commit suicide than the general population.

The proportion of attempted suicides which result in a completed or successful suicide was higher in cancer patients, with a higher proportion still in patients with urological cancers. Severe psychological stress is one of the main side-effects of both a diagnosis of cancer and the treatment, with depression affecting between 5 and 25% of cancer patients. Many are also affected by Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

Previous research has shown that the vast majority of cancer patients who have symptoms of depression often go untreated. The study shows a substantial increase in suicide attempts and successful suicides in cancer patients. It is the largest UK study looking at suicide in cancer patients. The research team led by Prashant Patel at the University of Birmingham in the UK examined the records from the England and Wales Hospital Episode Statistics database, from the period 2001 to 2011.

They linked this with cause of death statistics. This is also the first time that a major study has examined suicidal intent in cancer patients — which they defined as the ratio of successful suicides to the rate of attempted suicides. They found that this rate was far higher (1 to 7) in patients with prostate cancer than in the general population (1 to 25), which may show a greater determination to commit suicide in cancer patients.

“This is important as we know that people who attempt suicide are at higher risk of subsequently being successful in completing a suicide,” said Mehran Afshar from St George’s Hospital in London, UK. “We have shown this ‘intent’ to commit to be far higher in our cancer population, thus confirming a real need to address psychological issues early on in the management of these patients,” said Afshar.

Previous research has shown that a vast majority of cancer patients who have symptoms of depression go untreated. The study also showed significant differences between the time to a successful suicide, which means that some cancer patients are more vulnerable in certain periods. The researchers identified a total of 9,80,761 (4,93,234 males and 4,87,094 female) cancer patients which meant that 13.4 million-person years were included in the final data analysis. The team identified 162 suicides and 1,222 suicide attempts.

In the general population, the suicide rate is 10 per 1,00,000 people. The team found that the all-cancer suicide rate was 30 per 100,000 people. In the urological cancers, the figures are 36 per 100,000 people in kidney cancer, 48 suicides per 100,000 in bladder cancer, and 52 per 100,000 people in prostate cancer.

In the general population, there is an average of 25 suicide attempts for each successful suicide. In kidney cancer this ratio is 1 suicide for every 10 attempts. In bladder and prostate cancer, this ratio drops to one suicide for every 7 attempts.

The time taken to commit suicide also varies substantially. Median time to suicide is 175 days from diagnosis for kidney cancer, 846 days for prostate cancer, and 1,037 days for bladder cancer.

"No, hormones aren’t to be blamed for teen social behaviour",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/20/no-hormones-arent-to-be-blamed-for-teen-social-behaviour-1789826.html,"Tuesday, March 20, 2018 10:35 AM +0530","WASHINGTON: Turns out, reproductive hormones that develop during puberty are not responsible for changes in social behaviour that occur during adolescence.

""Changes in social behavior during adolescence appear to be independent of pubertal hormones. They are not triggered by puberty, so we can't blame the hormones,"" said lead author Matthew Paul from the University at Buffalo.

Disentangling the adolescent changes that are triggered by puberty from those unrelated to puberty is difficult because puberty and adolescence occur simultaneously, but Paul and his collaborators have found a way to tease out the two using a seasonal-breeding animal model.

His new model, explained in the study with co-authors Clemens Probst, provided a basic understanding that did not previously exist for what drives adolescent social development.

Adolescence is a critical period of development for individuals, noted Paul.

Complex thinking develops; many mental health disorders arise; and it is associated with the beginning of high-risk behaviours, like drug use. For social behaviour, it is a time when the focus of children's social relationships shifts from the family to peers. In other words, they stop wanting to hang out with mom and dad. It has been widely assumed that these changes can be attributed to increases in gonadal hormones at puberty.

""What we've done here is find a new way to ask the question of how puberty plays a role in adolescent development - a new way to determine which developmental changes pubertal hormones trigger and which changes they do not.""

In conversation, we might hear puberty and adolescence used interchangeably, yet biologically, they are two distinct processes.

Puberty is the process by which individuals develop the ability to reproduce. It is triggered by the activation of the reproductive axis, which is responsible for the development of reproductive capability, the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics, and the increase in gonadal hormones.

Adolescence is broader. It encompasses puberty, but also includes cognitive, social, and emotional changes that occur during the teenage years.

Paul noted, ""These findings are also important for adolescent mental health - understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible for adolescent development will provide insight into why so many mental health disorders arise during this time in life.""

"Social media negatively affects teen girls more than boys, finds research",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/20/social-media-negatively-affects-teen-girls-more-than-boys-finds-research-1789818.html,"Tuesday, March 20, 2018 10:10 AM +0530","WASHINGTON: Social media use may have different effects on wellbeing in adolescent boys and girls, according to a recent research.

Researchers at the University of Essex and UCL found an association between increased time spent on social media in early adolescence (age 10) and reduced wellbeing in later adolescence (age 10-15) - but only among girls.

Corresponding author Cara Booker said, ""Our findings suggest that it is important to monitor early interactions with social media, particularly in girls, as this could have an impact on wellbeing later in adolescence and perhaps throughout adulthood.""

The authors found that adolescent girls used social media more than boys and social media interaction increased with age for both boys and girls. At age 13, about a half of girls were interacting on social media for more than 1 hour per day, compared to just one third of boys. By age 15, both genders increased their social media use but girls continued to use social media more than boys, with 59% of girls and 46% of boys interacting on social media for one or more hours per day.

Wellbeing appeared to decline throughout adolescence in both boys and girls, as reflected in scores for happiness and other aspects of wellbeing. Booker said: ""Since we did not observe an association between social media use and wellbeing among boys, other factors, such as the amount of time spent gaming, might be associated with the boys' observed decline in wellbeing.""

The study used data from the youth panel of the UK Household Panel Study - a large national survey which interviews all members of a household annually, from 2009 - 2015. A total of 9,859 UK adolescents aged 10 to 15 years completed questions on how many hours they spent interacting on social media sites on a typical school day.

The authors found that throughout adolescence happiness scores dropped nearly three points from 36.9 to 33.3 in girls and two points from 36.02 to 34.55 in boys. While SDQ scores dropped for boys and increased for girls, indicating that girls experienced more negative aspects of wellbeing, the researchers concluded that overall wellbeing decreased for both.

The authors caution that because the study used the self-report data and only social media interactions on school days were recorded, the associations between social media and wellbeing may have been underestimated.

New male birth control pill found safe and effective,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/19/new-male-birth-control-pill-found-safe-and-effective-1789463.html,"Monday, March 19, 2018 06:36 PM +0530","WASHINGTON: In a major step forward in the development of a once-daily ""male pill"", researchers have found an experimental oral contraceptive to be safe in men with hormone responses consistent with effective contraception.



The findings presented at the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in Chicago showed that the new pill -- called dimethandrolone undecanoate, or DMAU -- appears to be safe when used daily for a month.



Like the pill for women, DMAU combines activity of an androgen (male hormone) like testosterone, and a progestin, and is taken once a day, said the study's senior investigator, Stephanie Page, Professor of Medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle.



""Many men say they would prefer a daily pill as a reversible contraceptive, rather than long-acting injections or topical gels, which are also in development,"" Page pointed out.



Progress toward a male birth control pill has been stymied because, according to Page, available oral forms of testosterone may cause liver inflammation, and they clear the body too quickly for once-daily dosing, thus requiring two doses a day.



However, DMAU contains undecanoate, a long-chain fatty acid, which Page said slows this clearance.



The study included 100 healthy men between ages 18 and 50 years.



The investigators tested three different doses of DMAU -- 100, 200, and 400 milligrams, or mg.



A total of 83 men completed the study, including giving blood samples for hormone and cholesterol testing on the first and last day of the study.



At the highest dose of DMAU tested, 400 mg, participants showed ""marked suppression"" of levels of their testosterone and two hormones required for sperm production.



The low levels, Page said, were consistent with effective male contraception shown in longer-term studies.



""Despite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,"" Page said.



All groups taking DMAU did have weight gain and decreases in HDL (high-density lipoprotein, or ""good"") cholesterol, both of which Page said were mild.



All participants passed safety tests, including markers of liver and kidney function, the study said.



""These promising results are unprecedented in the development of a prototype male pill,"" Page said.

According to the researchers, a man's semen count is a marker of his general health and fertility evaluation gives them the unique opportunity for health assessment and disease prevention.

""Our study clearly shows that low sperm count by itself is associated with metabolic alterations, cardiovascular risk, and low bone mass,"" said lead author Alberto Ferlin, Associate Professor at the University of Brescia in Italy.

""Infertile men are likely to have important co-existing health problems or risk factors that can impair quality of life and shorten their lives,"" said Ferlin, who conducted the study when he was in the University of Padova.

For the study, presented at the ENDO 2018: The Endocrine Society's 100th Annual Meeting and Expo, researchers studied 5,177 male partners of infertile couples.

All the men in the study had a sperm analysis as part of a comprehensive health evaluation, which included measurement of their reproductive hormones and metabolic parameters.

The researchers found that about half the men had low sperm counts and were 1.2 times more likely than those with normal sperm counts to have greater body fat; higher blood pressure, ""bad"" (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides; and lower ""good"" (HDL) cholesterol.

They also had a higher frequency of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of these and other metabolic risk factors that increase the chance of developing diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, said the researchers.

A measure of insulin resistance, another problem that can lead to diabetes, also was higher in men with low sperm counts.

The researchers found a 12-fold increased risk of hypogonadism, or low testosterone levels, in men with low sperm counts.

Half the men with low testosterone had osteoporosis or low bone mass, a possible precursor to osteoporosis, as found on a bone density scan.

NEW YORK: A small, daily dose of the popular erectile dysfunction drug Viagra may significantly reduce colorectal cancer risk, shows a study in mice.

Viagra cut in half the formation of polyps, an abnormal and often asymptomatic clump of cells on the lining of the intestines that may become cancer, said the study published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research.

Next steps should include a clinical trial for the drug in patients considered at high risk of colorectal cancer, such as those with a strong family history, multiple previous polyps and chronic intestinal inflammation like colitis, said corresponding author of the study Darren Browning from the Medical College of Georgia at the Augusta University.

Viagra has been used safely for years in a wide range of doses and age groups, from premature infants with pulmonary hypertension to the elderly with erectile dysfunction, he noted.

When placed in the drinking water, the researchers found that Viagra reduced polyps in a mouse model with a genetic mutation that occurs in humans, causing them to produce hundreds of polyps starting as teenagers and essentially always resulting in colorectal cancer.

""Giving a baby dose of Viagra can reduce the amount of tumours in these animals by half,"" Browning said.

Viagra is best known for its ability to relax the smooth muscle cells around blood vessels so the vessels can more easily fill with blood, which is how it helps both erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.

But Browning's lab also showed that it also increases levels of the chemical cyclic GMP, which is known to affect the intestinal lining, called the epithelium.

The researchers found that the results of increased cyclic GMP include suppression of some of the excessive cell proliferation that occurs in the gut and an increase in normal cell differentiation as well as the natural elimination of abnormal cells, through a process called apoptosis.

""When we give Viagra, we shrink the whole proliferating compartment.

""The popularity of electronic cigarettes has been rapidly increasing in part because of advertisements that they are safer than conventional cigarettes. But because extra fat in the liver is likely to be detrimental to health, we conclude that e-cigarettes are not as safe as they have been promoted to consumers,"" said lead author Theodore C. Friedman of Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles, Calif. ""This has important public health and regulatory implications.""

E-cigarettes contain nicotine, which Dr Friedman and other researchers have reported is associated with non-alcohol fatty liver diseases. However, the long-term effects of e-cigarettes on liver disease, diabetes, heart disease or stroke are unknown.

In the 12-week study, Friedman and colleagues studied mice missing the gene for apolipoprotein E, which makes them more prone to developing heart disease and fat in the liver. All of the mice were fed a diet relatively high in fat and cholesterol. One group of mice was put in a chamber that exposed them to e-cigarette aerosol, so that their blood nicotine levels were similar to that of smokers and e-cigarette users. A second group of mice were exposed to saline aerosol.

The researchers collected liver samples, and looked at genes in the liver affected by e-cigarettes using a technique called RNA sequence analysis. They found changes in 433 genes that were associated with fatty liver development and progression in the mice exposed to e-cigarettes. The researchers also found that genes related to circadian rhythms (the body clock) were changed in mice exposed to e-cigarettes. Circadian rhythm dysfunction is known to accelerate the development of liver disease including fatty liver diseases.

""Our experimental results will provide support to policymakers and federal and state regulatory bodies to take preventive measures to stop the increasing use of e-cigarettes among both children and adults,"" Friedman said.

Why diabetes lurks among sleep-deprived men,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/19/why-diabetes-lurks-among-sleep-deprived-men-1789311.html,"Monday, March 19, 2018 11:10 AM +0530","WASHINGTON DC: There's a link between insufficient sleep and the development of insulin resistance, one of the factors that cause type 2 diabetes, and now, a team of researchers has discovered a biological reason for this relationship, at least in men: an imbalance between their testosterone and cortisol hormones.

""Our highly controlled sleep study showed that even one night of restricted sleep can cause insulin resistance and that we can dampen this effect by controlling levels of these two important hormones,"" said senior investigator Peter Y. Liu of Los Angeles Biomedical (LA BioMed) Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, Calif.

Insulin resistance occurs when the body does not properly use the hormone insulin. Testosterone is the main anabolic, or muscle-building, hormone, whereas cortisol--often called the ""stress hormone""--helps catabolism, or breaking down energy and fat stores for use, Liu explained. Past research shows that sleep loss reduces a man's testosterone levels and increases cortisol levels.

Liu and his fellow researchers conducted five nights of sleep studies in 34 healthy men with an average age of 33. They controlled what the subjects ate and how much they slept, giving them 10 hours of sleep the first night and restricting them to four hours of sleep the remaining nights.

In this ""crossover"" study, the men served as their own controls. In one series of sleep studies, they received three medications: ketoconazole, which switches off the body's production of testosterone and cortisol; testosterone gel; and oral hydrocortisone, a synthetic form of cortisol. The doses of testosterone and hydrocortisone were in the midrange of levels that the body normally produces, according to Liu. This arm of the study was called a dual ""clamp"" because it stopped the body's production of these two hormones and then gave them a fixed amount of the hormones, thus clamping levels in a normal hormonal balance, he said.

In another set of experiments, the men received inactive placebos that matched the medications. The order of when they received the clamp and the placebo was random, with a two-week interval between the study conditions. The morning after the first and last nights of each part of the study, all men took the oral glucose tolerance test, in which they gave blood samples while fasting and again after drinking a sugary drink. This test result allowed the researchers to calculate each man's insulin resistance using standard measures, including the Matsuda Index.

After sleep restriction, this index reportedly showed greater insulin resistance with both the clamp and the placebo. However, Liu said this increase was significantly dampened, or less severe, with the dual-clamp, demonstrating that testosterone and cortisol reduced the negative effects of sustained sleep restriction on insulin resistance.

""Maintaining hormonal balance could prevent metabolic ill health occurring in individuals who do not get enough sleep,"" he said. ""Understanding these hormonal mechanisms could lead to new treatments or strategies to prevent insulin resistance due to insufficient sleep.""

""This study shows that, in obese insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients, a diet with three meals per day, consisting of a big breakfast, average lunch and small dinner, had many rapid and positive effects compared to the traditional diet with six small meals evenly distributed throughout the day: better weight loss, less hunger and better diabetes control while using less insulin,"" said lead author Daniela Jakubowicz of the Tel Aviv University.

""The hour of the day--when you eat and how frequently you eat--is more important than what you eat and how many calories you eat,"" she noted. ""Our body metabolism changes throughout the day. A slice of bread consumed at breakfast leads to a lower glucose response and is less fattening than an identical slice of bread consumed in the evening.""

Jakubowicz and her colleagues studied 11 women and 18 men who had obesity and type 2 diabetes, being treated with insulin and averaged 69 years of age. The patients were randomly assigned to consume one of two different weight-loss diets, which contained an equal number of daily calories, for three months. One group (Bdiet) ate three meals: a large breakfast, a medium-sized lunch and a small dinner. The second group (6Mdiet) ate the traditional diet for diabetes and weight loss: six small meals evenly spaced throughout the day, including three snacks.

Overall glucose levels and glucose spikes were measured for 14 days at baseline, during the first two weeks on diet, and at the end of the study by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Glucose levels were tested every two weeks and insulin dosage was adjusted as needed.

At three months, while the Bdiet group lost 5 kilograms (11 pounds) the 6Mdiet group gained 1.4 kg (3 lb).

Fasting glucose levels decreased 54 mg/dl (from 161 to 107) in the Bdiet group but only 23 mg/dl (from 164 to 141) in the 6Mdiet group. Overall mean glucose levels dropped in the first 14 days by 29 mg/dl (from 167 to 138 mg/dl) and 38 mg/dl (from 167 to 129 mg/dl) after three months in the Bdiet group. Overall mean glucose levels dropped only 9 mg/dl (from 171 to 162 mg/dl) in the first 14 days and only 17 mg/dl (from 171 to 154 mg/dl) in the 6Mdiet group.

Mean glucose levels during sleep dropped only in the Bdiet group, by 24 mg/dl (from 131 to 107), but not in the 6Mdiet group.

The Bdiet group needed significantly less insulin (-20.5 units/day, from 54.7 to 34.8) while the 6Mdiet group needed more insulin (+2.2 units/day, from 67.8 to 70).

Carbohydrate craving and hunger decreased significantly in Bdiet group but increased in the 6Mdiet group.

Importantly, the researchers found a significant reduction of overall glycemia after as little as 14 days on Bdiet, when the participant had almost the same weight as at baseline. This finding suggests that even before weight loss, the change in the meal timing itself has a quick beneficial effect on glucose balance that is further improved by the important weight loss found in the 3M diet.

""A diet with adequate meal timing and frequency has a pivotal role in glucose control and weight loss,"" Jakubowicz observed.

Why breastfeeding moms should avoid overeating,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/19/why-breastfeeding-moms-should-avoid-overeating-1789290.html,"Monday, March 19, 2018 08:53 AM +0530","WASHINGTON DC: New mommies, you may want to avoid overeating as according to a recent study, you may be risking your kids' health.

Mothers who overeat during the period when they are breastfeeding may have children who are at increased risk of becoming obese and going through early puberty, the study of mice suggested. Early puberty may lead to increased risk of diabetes or reproductive problems later in life.

""Formula feeding is well known to increase the risk of obesity in children. Our findings suggest, however, that when breastfeeding mothers do not eat a moderate and healthy diet, there can also be increased risks of various health problems in the offspring, including obesity, diabetes, advanced puberty and reduced fertility,"" said lead researcher Mengjie Wang of the University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences in Toledo, Ohio. ""This idea must be tested in humans to know whether it applies to our species.""

Wang noted that all over the world, puberty is starting earlier than it did in the past. ""Childhood obesity, a common health issue, is one of the risk factors for early puberty,"" she said. ""Previous evidence from animals has revealed that post-weaning overeating advances the timing of puberty, but we lack knowledge of how nutrition before weaning influences metabolism and reproduction.""

To determine how excess body weight alters the timing of puberty, Wang gave mice a high-fat-diet from the date they gave birth and started breastfeeding until they weaned their pups. A second group of new mother mice was given a regular diet for the same amount of time.

Wang found that overfeeding the mothers during breastfeeding can cause obesity in the pups and significantly advance the start of their puberty. ""These results show that the breast-feeding phase is a critical window that influences when puberty happens,"" Wang said.

Fertility tests of the mice in adulthood showed that those whose mothers had been fed a high-fat diet while breastfeeding had decreased litter size, longer duration from mating to date of birth and impaired pregnancy rate in both female and male mice. The researchers also found these mice suffered from glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity--signs of an increased risk of developing diabetes during adulthood.

""Our results reinforce the findings of previous studies that childhood obesity causes advanced puberty and metabolic disorders in adulthood,"" Wang said. ""Correct treatment and follow-up are both important for patients with early puberty. Patients with early puberty should be aware that other health problems may arise after they become adults.""

The research was presented at ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society's 100th annual meeting in Chicago.","WASHINGTON DC: New mommies, you may want to avoid overeating as according to a recent study, you may be risking your kids' health.

Why diabetes lurks among sleep-deprived men,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/19/why-diabetes-lurks-among-sleep-deprived-men-1789287.html,"Monday, March 19, 2018 08:31 AM +0530","WASHINGTON DC: There's a link between insufficient sleep and the development of insulin resistance, one of the factors that cause type 2 diabetes, and now, a team of researchers has discovered a biological reason for this relationship, at least in men: an imbalance between their testosterone and cortisol hormones.

""Our highly controlled sleep study showed that even one night of restricted sleep can cause insulin resistance and that we can dampen this effect by controlling levels of these two important hormones,"" said senior investigator Peter Y. Liu of Los Angeles Biomedical (LA BioMed) Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, Calif.

Insulin resistance occurs when the body does not properly use the hormone insulin. Testosterone is the main anabolic, or muscle-building, hormone, whereas cortisol--often called the ""stress hormone""--helps catabolism, or breaking down energy and fat stores for use, Liu explained. Past research shows that sleep loss reduces a man's testosterone levels and increases cortisol levels.

Liu and his fellow researchers conducted five nights of sleep studies in 34 healthy men with an average age of 33. They controlled what the subjects ate and how much they slept, giving them 10 hours of sleep the first night and restricting them to four hours of sleep the remaining nights.

In this ""crossover"" study, the men served as their own controls. In one series of sleep studies, they received three medications: ketoconazole, which switches off the body's production of testosterone and cortisol; testosterone gel; and oral hydrocortisone, a synthetic form of cortisol. The doses of testosterone and hydrocortisone were in the midrange of levels that the body normally produces, according to Liu. This arm of the study was called a dual ""clamp"" because it stopped the body's production of these two hormones and then gave them a fixed amount of the hormones, thus clamping levels in a normal hormonal balance, he said.

In another set of experiments, the men received inactive placebos that matched the medications. The order of when they received the clamp and the placebo was random, with a two-week interval between the study conditions. The morning after the first and last nights of each part of the study, all men took the oral glucose tolerance test, in which they gave blood samples while fasting and again after drinking a sugary drink. This test result allowed the researchers to calculate each man's insulin resistance using standard measures, including the Matsuda Index.

After sleep restriction, this index reportedly showed greater insulin resistance with both the clamp and the placebo. However, Liu said this increase was significantly dampened, or less severe, with the dual-clamp, demonstrating that testosterone and cortisol reduced the negative effects of sustained sleep restriction on insulin resistance.

""Maintaining hormonal balance could prevent metabolic ill health occurring in individuals who do not get enough sleep,"" he said. ""Understanding these hormonal mechanisms could lead to new treatments or strategies to prevent insulin resistance due to insufficient sleep.""

Stay in shape to cut heart disease risk,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/18/stay-in-shape-to-cut-heart-disease-risk-1789036.html,"Sunday, March 18, 2018 04:40 PM +0530","LONDON: If you thought it might be possible to be overweight or obese but not at increased risk of heart disease, think again! A new study of nearly 300,000 people has found that unhealthy weight gain can raise risk of heart attacks, strokes and high blood pressure.



The risk of heart and blood vessel problems increases as body mass index (BMI) increases beyond 22-23 kg per square metre, said the study published in the European Heart Journal.



Furthermore, the findings showed that the risk also increases steadily the more fat a person carries around their waist.



""By maintaining a healthy BMI of around 22-23 kg per square metre, healthy people can minimise their risk of developing or dying from heart disease,"" said lead researcher Stamatina Iliodromiti from University of Glasgow in Britain.



Although it is already known that being overweight or obese increases a person's risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as other diseases such as cancer, there have also been studies that have suggested otherwise.



These studies have cliamed that, particularly in the elderly, being overweight or even obese might not have any effect on deaths from CVD or other causes, and may even be protective, especially if people maintain a reasonable level of fitness.



This is known as the ""obesity paradox"".



However, the new study refute these previous, conflicting findings.



""Any public misconception of a potential 'protective' effect of fat on heart and stroke risks should be challenged,"" Iliodromiti said.



The researchers found that as BMI increased above 22 kg per square metre, the risk of CVD increased by 13 per cent for every 5.2 kg per square metre increase in women and 4.3 kg per square metre in men.



""This is the largest study that provides evidence against the obesity paradox in healthy people,"" Iliodromiti said.



""It is possible that the story may be different for those with pre-existing disease because there is evidence that in cancer patients, for instance, being slightly overweight is associated with lower risk, especially as cancer and its treatments can lead to unhealthy weight loss,"" she added.","LONDON: If you thought it might be possible to be overweight or obese but not at increased risk of heart disease, think again!

Slim figure obsession eats up teenagers,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/12/slim-figure-obsession-eats-up-teenagers-1785740.html,"Sunday, March 18, 2018 11:50 AM +0530","CHENNAI: We live in an age of apps that ‘perfect’ your facial features, cut the fat, lighten skin tone and do what a fairy Godmother once did with the swipe of a wand in fairy tales. At a time when self-worth is measured in the number of likes one gets for pictures and the number of friends and followers one has online, a lot boils down to that ‘perfect’ picture. With this comes an almost unrealistic expectation or aspiration of how one should look, which is fuelling the prevalence of eating disorders which is dismissed by many. While the prevalence of eating disorders in India is lower than that of western countries it appears to be increasing, according to experts.

An eating disorder is defined as a persistent disturbance of eating behaviour or behaviour intended to control weight, which significantly impairs physical health or psychosocial functioning, often turning out to be a chronic psychiatric condition. They tend to be emotional disorders that focus on food, but are actually attempts to deal with perfectionism and a desire to gain control by strictly regulating food and weight, experts said. The common types of eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder.Treatment for these kinds of disorders has to be a multi-pronged approach, experts said.

“Dietary treatment alone will not help without counselling as it is a psychological problem,” said Raj. “When someone has anorexia nervosa, there are a number of other issues that they face like dental issues, acidity, chronic sore throat and so on. In order to treat such a patient, it is imperative to have a good general physician who can help with sorting out the medical issues, a trained psychologist or counsellor who can help in bringing in a positive outlook on body image and a dietician who can educate the patient on the importance of a balanced diet.”

Psychological counsellor Sneha Hindocha concurred with Raj’s view. She stressed the importance of a holistic approach to the treatment process and said acceptance of the issue is the first step towards treatment.“When it comes to body image issues, the only way a patient can get better is if they accept and believe that they are okay with the way their bodies are,” said Hindocha.

“Counselling is a powerful tool that can help such patients but when it comes to severe cases, medication is a must, especially in severe anorexia cases where the patient has lost a lot of weight as it can be life-threatening. The support of family and friends is essential in these cases as they play a bigger role than the counsellor. Sensitising them to the needs of the patients is crucial.”

Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterised by excessive restriction on food intake and irrational fear of gaining weight, often accompanied by a distorted body self-perception, explained a report published in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine in April, 2015. It is clinically diagnosed more frequently in females, with type and severity varying with each case. While the cases of anorexia nervosa are reported greatly in the grey literatures of the western countries, the number of clinical cases in India is on the rise, the report said. The age of onset for most cases ranges between 12 to 20 years and most cases are brought to clinical attention only when there are severe somatic complaints. In developing countries like India, severe anorexia is not commonly reported.

“The body gets its energy from carbohydrates, proteins and fats,” said dietician Dr Preethi Raj. “In the case of anorexia, the patient generally restricts carbohydrates which is very harmful as in the case of adolescents and young adults, carbohydrates should constitute 45-65% of the total calories. Not having a proper intake can lead to adverse issues like malnutrition and muscle loss. Further, it has protein sparing action. Most of them take fruits and vegetables only and it doesn’t give enough protein and fat. Protein is important for immunity fighting against infection while fat makes hormones.”

Experts have emphasised greatly the role that social media played in sparking a negative body image. They said that, in turn, lays the foundation for eating disorders to gain a stronghold in the minds of impressionable youngsters.“Social media is the forum where the perception of the self and worthiness of the self is measured today,” said Mumbai-based cyber psychologist Nirali Bhatia. “Being picture perfect and the need to be accepted, appreciated and acknowledged by others weighs down heavily on a number of people. There’s also a huge information overload that has come in with the internet, which provides young children with access to unverified information too early that has the potential to colour their perception.”

Raj said that parents and friends should look out for a few tell-tale signs. These include malnutrition, sunken eyes, bloated belly, constipation or diarrhoea, erratic menstrual cycle, insomnia or disturbed sleep, waking up in the wee hours of the morning and frequent changes in weight.

“Eating disorders tend to stem from low self-esteem and peer pressure,” said Bhatia. “I have noticed that a number of young children are facing issues of binge eating where it forms a cycle of overeating and starvation. Most of these children are either bullied in person or online and find some comfort in food. They tend to get a rush the moment they eat, which relieves their stress and right after that they feel a sense of guilt and starve themselves.”

Experts believe that awareness is the key to overcoming these disorders. They said that most people take these issues lightly as they themselves do not know how these disorders can wreck havoc on their bodies.

Eat Right to Score Right,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/17/eat-right-to-score-right-1787720.html,"Saturday, March 17, 2018 01:01 PM +0530","Like most students, Dev, who is in Class XII, is stressed out due to exams and the burden of good results. His neighbour, Arnav, had scored 93 per cent in his boards last year and now similar result was expected from Dev. Like him, many students find themselves stuck in the marsh of expectations. So, here are tips that can ensure good health, increased concentration, less stress and more productivity.

Foods to munch on

■ Protein-rich foods such as eggs, fish, cottage cheese, tofu, pulses, figs, prunes, almonds (five a day) and walnuts (two per day) soaked overnight are recommended.

■ You can munch on sunflower and flax seeds during the day to satisfy your hunger pangs.

■ Have porridge, oats, muesli, wholegrain cereal, multigrain bread or chapatti for breakfast.

■ Fruits are an excellent brain fuel. Have bananas,

oranges, strawberries, and cantaloupes etc.

■ Having citrus fruits will help boost the Vitamin C levels in the body, keeping your immunity high and guarding you from cold and cough.

■ Have fresh vegetables such as carrots, bell peppers, spinach, broccoli, beetroot etc, to fulfil your nutritional requirement.

■ Staying hydrated is important: Have at least three litres (1-12 glasses) of water daily.

■ One can also have protein bars/granola bars/fruits as snacks.



Foods to avoid

■ Limit your sugar intake as it will give instant gratification but are mere calories that lead to weight gain.

■ Control the intake of foods rich in carbohydrates like potatoes, rice etc, as they will lead to sleepiness.

■ Oily foods will only dim your energy levels, so stay away from fried foods.

■ Avoid drinking too much of coffee and tea as it adds to the nervousness.

■ Never have tea or coffee empty stomach as it can cause acidity and headache.



Diet for D-Day

■ Start your day with soaked walnuts and almonds.

■ Never leave the house empty stomach. Have oats, muesli, wholegrain bread for breakfast as they are rich in dietary fibres and will

keep you satiated during the long exam hours.

■ Always carry water with you and keep drinking water throughout the day to stay hydrated.

■ Alternatively, you can also carry lime water. A lot of students experience nervousness during exam. This can be due to low electrolyte levels or low blood pressure. Sipping fresh lime water will keep you in better shape.

■ You can carry a bottle of fresh orange juice or Glucon D, and keep sipping to control anxiety.

■ Protein shake or smoothie is another yummy option. Mix your favourite fruit pulp with curd to make smoothie or replace the curd with milk to get tasty shakes. Add nuts to the same.

■ You can have nut milk, boiled milk with cashew, almonds, raisins a night before the exams.

The Wholesome Winged Beans,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/17/the-wholesome-winged-beans-1787719.html,"Saturday, March 17, 2018 01:00 PM +0530","I love visiting Auroville, the Mother’s experiment in international living to promote peace, because I always come across something unusual—from the mundane to the exotic.I dropped in at the Pour Tous store where vegetables from the local farms are brought in, most of which are organic. I stumbled upon a vegetable that I rarely see in Chennai, the bearded bean (the winged bean or thadi avarai as it is known in Tamil). Its scientific name is Psophocarpus tetragonolobos.

It is a crunchy vegetable, which makes an excellent salad. Just chop it in ½ cm slices, add a liberal quantity of lime juice, salt and a few tiny pieces of green chilly. It tastes delicious and I usually have it with sambar sadam (rice). Many south Indians love it as an accompaniment to curd rice. The vegetable with a very benign taste can be modified as you like—you can add chat masala, mayonnaise or pep it up with feta cheese. And if you like the juice of mahali kizhangu (Decalepis hamiltonii plant), you can soak them in the juice, which has many therapeutic qualities. It is an excellent antioxidant.

I got a huge quantity of winged beans, distributed them among friends and relatives, got a jar of mahali kizhangu juice from my sister, soaked the pieces of thadi avarrai in it, and I am generally enjoying my acquaintance with thadi avarrai. It is great for weight watchers as it is low in calories and can be a substitute for salad. It is disease-resistant and pesticide-free. The winged bean is nutrient-rich with almost all parts of the plant—leaves, flowers, seeds and tubers—being edible. We have not really exploited the potential of this plant.

A lady with whom I was having a conversation said she cut the vegetable into small pieces and sautéed it like ladies’ fingers. Since the bean is rich in copper, it is extremely good for the heart. It is an excellent source of fibre, vitamin C, vitamin A and minerals. It is also a rich source of protein and B-complex vitamins. It is easy to grow from seed and can be grown in backyards and terraces. It is a prolific yielder and gladdens the heart of the gardener, as it is pest-resistant and manageable. Yet another concoction that I love is elandai vada (Indian Jujube) made from small jujube fruits (Ziziphus jujuba). The one we get in the market are the bigger ones and taste like pears or apples. The small fruits,

which have everything from anti-cancer properties to anti-obesity properties, once used to be the favourite

fruit of schoolchildren in Tamil Nadu. You will see vendors selling these jujube fruits along with mangos, groundnuts, and small gooseberries outside most government schools here.

The way I love to eat elandai vada is where the fruit is crushed by hand (along with the seeds) and added to roughly pounded red chillies, tamarind, salt and asafoetida. The mixture is made into small round cakes and sun-dried. Once sun-dried, it can be stored in bottles. It is a great appetiser with anti-oxidant properties. It is also said to prevent diabetic neuropathy and helps reduce anxiety.

Next time I visit Pour Tous in Auroville, I hope to see the small variety of jujube fruit, and may also come across some forgotten or rarely used vegetables or fruits.

Punjab Hits the Ground Running,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/17/punjab-hits-the-ground-running-1787718.html,"Saturday, March 17, 2018 12:56 PM +0530","Baba Fauja Singh is an inspiring sight. At the young age of 106, the world’s oldest marathoner is still making heads turn. And, of course, there is the 75-year-old Amar Chauhan, famously known as ‘Uncle ji’. Hailing from Mohali, this former Punjab Government employee has run a total of 39 half and full marathons. There are countless examples of men and women who have taken up running at various points in their lives propelled by a simple desire—to be fit. And Punjab is definitely showing the way.

Whether you’re a beginner or a hard core athlete, just strap on your shoes and join a running club in Punjab. In the last one year, around 25 running clubs have been established in various cities of the state. Boasting around 1.5 lakh members, these clubs in Chandigarh, Patiala, Ludhiana, Bathinda, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ferozepur, Mohali, Muktsar are not only promising a healthy lifestyle but also a sense of adventure to retirees.

Chauhan, who retired as Special Secretary from Punjab Government in 2001, says, “I saw youngsters in Abbotsford running, so I decided to run too. I participated in my first half marathon in May 2012, and there was no looking back. I have won 35 marathon events in the 70-plus age category.” He wants to climb Mount Everest on his 80th birthday and run for the Chandigarh Distance Runners.

A 1994-batch Indian Forest Service officer of Punjab cadre, Dharminder Sharma, who has formed six running clubs in the state (Chandigarh Runners, Patiala Runners, Ludhiana Runners, Bathinda Runners, Jalandhar Runners and Amritsar Runners), says, “I along with some like-minded friends established the Chandigarh Runners couple of years back and now the club has around 4,000 runners and the Patiala club has more than 12,000 members—the biggest in the state.”The members of these clubs run on weekends. All these clubs organise their own running events, including half, full and ultra marathons.

Taruna Sharma, who owns a travelling group, started the running club ‘We Run Ludhiana’ in 2016. He says, “People have become health conscious. They want to run but not in air-conditioned buildings, but rather out among nature.”Not very long ago, there was hardly any running culture in Bathinda, but now all that is changing, Tejinder Singh says. He started his Bathinda Runners Club and is all set to organise the first Bathinda Marathon on March 25, which is expected to see see participation of more than 500 people.

Dr Sumeet Kumar Jarangal, Deputy Commissioner and the brain behind the Muktsar Marathon to be held on March 18, says: “We have got 5,000 registered confirmations and expect 10,000 runners to take part. People are becoming more fitness-oriented.”

In his forties, farmer Simar Kamboj runs daily for five kilometres and is an active member of Patiala Runners. Patiala is a city of gardens, says Kamboj, and people love outdoor activities. This egged enthusiasts to channelise it in a professional way and organise runs. These runs see immense participation across all age groups.Paveela Bali, founder of the The Run Club in Chandigarh, says often people are scared to go to gyms as they might end up exercising alone. “While running together people form a bond. It’s a community of runners and people feel comfortable,” she smiles.

From greater self-confidence to a soaring career, healthy teeth can truly transform the positivity of your mind-set and also create that perfect impression.



Delhi based dentist Ekta Chadha speaks about tips on keeping the pearly whites strong and healthy.



* Target the right area: Toothbrushing is an important part of daily dental care routine. Keeping the area where your teeth meet your gums clean can prevent gum disease, while keeping your tooth surfaces clean can help keep cavities at bay. Also, changing your toothbrush every 3-4 months is highly recommended if the bristles are frayed.



* Choosing the right toothpaste: When it comes to choosing the right toothpaste for you, it's important to think about your unique oral health needs. For example, if you have sensitive teeth, using a specialized desensitizing toothpaste, instead of basic toothpaste will help provide greater relief and is safe to use as well.



* Flossing is as important as tooth brushing: Cleaning between your teeth may help prevent cavities and remove plaque. Flossing cleans the areas which are difficult for a toothbrush to reach. It removes the food debris and plaque accumulated between the teeth.



* Sugar is the culprit of tooth decay: At every age, a healthy diet is essential for keeping the teeth in a healthy state. However, sugary foods have been known as real culprits of tooth decay. When bacteria in the mouth break down simple sugars, they produce high acids that can erode tooth enamel, opening the door to decay. Hence, it is advisable to cut down on foods and drinks that are high in acid such as sodas.



Ajay Kakar, a dentist, too has some tips to share:



* You're brushing too hard: Aggressive toothbrushing is a well-intentioned mistake! You may feel that brushing harder will remove more leftover food and the bacteria, but gentle brushing is all that is needed. When you brush too hard, it can wear down the teeth enamel and damage the gums.



* Choosing a wrong toothbrush: An important feature of a toothbrush is the bristles that remove the bacteria and loosen plaque from your teeth and gums. Sometimes, you may think that the harder the bristles are, the more they'll clean. But that's not true. Compared to hard bristles, soft bristles can clean teeth more effectively.



* Not brushing long enough: The average time a person brushes his teeth is about 33 seconds. This is only one-sixth the amount of time necessary for teeth to achieve plaque-free status. When in doubt, follow the 2s: 2 minutes, 2 times a day rule.



* Forgetting to clean other parts of the mouth: Another common mistake, while your toothbrush is at work, you may brush your front teeth more than the rest and leave out certain parts of your mouth. She suggests that brushing should be an equal opportunity activity, targeting the inside, outside and chewing surfaces of your teeth, as well as your gums, and your tongue.



* Using an old toothbrush: Do you find yourself using the same old toothbrush while the seasons change around you? Are your brush bristles getting frayed? If yes, bust this bad habit and resolve to use a new brush every three to four months.



* Brushing after meals : Wait at least half an hour before brushing to let your saliva naturally neutralize the acids.

Looking for natural remedies for chapped and dry lips? Treat your lips to balms with superfoods- The New Indian Express,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/17/looking-for-natural-remedies-for-chapped-and-dry-lips-treat-your-it-to-balms-with-superfoods-1788567.html,"Saturday, March 17, 2018 10:32 AM +0530","NEW DELHI: Hydrated, healthy lips can elevate your appearance. Use lip balms with superfoods like blueberries, and exfoliate chapped lips with a product with right ingredients like coconut oil or jojoba oil and brown sugar, suggest experts.



Dolly Kumar, founder at Skinella and Bindiya Gupta, beauty expert at Organic Harvest, have given few inputs:



* Use balms infused with superfoods:



Blueberries: These contain anti-oxidants that protect from premature ageing.



Grapefruits and mandarins: These are rich in vitamin A and C, minerals and antioxidants and the potassium present in the grapefruit provides a protective shield against UV rays.



Cranberries: This fruit contains a high percentage of vitamin B3, vitamin B5 and antioxidants making it useful in shielding you from any harm caused due to environmental factors.



* Brush your lips. Apply a thin layer of a multipurpose organic balm, then use a soft toothbrush to gently scrub the dead skin off. Make sure you're using a new toothbrush for this purpose so you don't scrub toothpaste into your lip's delicate skin or dead skin cells onto your teeth.



* Using coconut oil and sugar is a really simple, inexpensive and easy do-it-yourself to exfoliate your lips. Mix together a little organic coconut oil with some granulated sugar then scrub your lips with it. Just rinse it off when you're done and apply a bit of lip balm.



* Rose water and glycerine are both said to have various benefits. While rosewater will leave a light pink tint on your lips, the glycerine will take away the dry and dead skin. Combine both these products and apply it to your lips and get rid of all the dead skin and dryness.



* Use jojoba oil as it will provide the much-wanted nourishment and moisturising effect. Mix it with brown sugar as it is good for exfoliation. Scrub your lips with this mix and witness the smooth lips that are free from all the dirt and dryness. Massage it in for not more than 3-4 minutes.



* Green tea oil is full of goodness and antioxidants that can help calm, reduce redness, reveal radiance that looks healthy and has a glow all year around. It makes for the perfect scrub for this time of the year to help prolong the summer glow.



When applied topically, it is an effective treatment for preventing bleeding lips.","Apply a thin layer of a multipurpose organic balm, then use a soft toothbrush to gently scrub the dead skin off.

Do you judge before you love?- The New Indian Express,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/16/do-you-judge-before-you-love-1788240.html,"Saturday, March 17, 2018 09:44 AM +0530","In many of the mythological stories one grows up with in India, as well as in the more western fairy tales of romance and love, there is often the tests that love has to go through before it is hailed as true and worthy. In Indian mythology, there were stories of the lover travelling across seven seas and seven mountains, battling untold miseries, demons and temptations, to get a token that the beloved asked for in a moment of whimsy. Or bows had to be strung, flowers plucked from treacherous mountain tops, jewellery made or houses built. There were royals who decried that the suitor must prove worthy of the royal heir’s love by solving a dozen puzzles, battling wild animals and what not.

Other cultures had similar stories as well. Japanese stories of star-crossed lovers who wait eternities to meet their loved one, Hawaiian stories of a lover chasing the moon where it meets the sea to bring pearls like never seen before. Hundreds and thousands of stories of lovers proving their love’s true worth before the happy ending.

In real life, or IRL as we know it nowadays, do we still test love before accepting it? We may not ask for the moon or jewels or what have you, but test we still do. All the time, some times. The tests are often quite small: “Give me your phone, I want to see your pictures.” “What’s your password for your google mail?” “My mother wants to meet you. What are you doing this weekend?” If the answer is not quite what is expected, the grades on the love test start to dip. There are so many other little tests, like when you are walking together and you are reaching out with your hand, and though both of you are looking ahead, you still look if your hand is being held. Or that time when you are in a mall, and you watch to see who your lover is watching.

Even after years of being together, the testing continues in subtle and not so subtle ways: could be about who brings the milk in, or walks the dog on a rainy day, or who gets to decide where one goes for the Sunday dinner.Then, can you really stop testing ever? How long before you know well and for sure that all the testing is done and it is a given, now and forever? Or are we doomed as a species to forever test and be tested, with only the intermittent lulls of peace and quiet, like summer and Christmas holidays between unit tests and term exams at school?

An old friend once had an insight to offer: the real test, according to them, was if you could scratch where it itched and let your body be as it will, making whatever sound it would, whenever it needed to, without feeling judged for it. “Have you found that love?” I asked, and that friend laughed, “No, I still judge!”","Or bows had to be strung, flowers plucked from treacherous mountain tops, jewellery made or houses built.

This is how early puberty may result in obesity for women,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/17/this-is-how-early-puberty-may-result-in-obesity-for-women-1788562.html,"Saturday, March 17, 2018 09:41 AM +0530","LONDON: Turns out, early puberty is linked to the increased risk of obesity for women.

According to a study led by the Imperial College London, girls who start puberty earlier are more likely to be overweight as adults.

The researchers say their findings strengthen existing evidence of a link between the onset of puberty and a woman's body mass in adulthood.

Previous studies have established a link between obesity and puberty, with increased bodyweight known to be a risk factor for girls starting puberty earlier.

But now this latest research shows that early puberty is itself a risk factor for being overweight, with girls who have their first period earlier more likely to have a higher Body Mass Index (BMI).

According to the authors of the study, their findings help to untangle these complex external factors and add insight into an underlying causal link, showing that early puberty has a significant impact on a woman's risk of obesity.

Dr Dipender Gill, the first author of the study, said: ""Previous studies have shown there is an association, but we didn't know whether early puberty caused obesity in adulthood, or was simply associated with it. In our latest study, we've generated evidence to support that it is a causal effect.""

In order to get around the effects of confounding factors, the research team used genetic variants as a tool to look at the effect of the onset of puberty (known as age at menarche), measured as the age of a girl's first period.

In the latest study, researchers employed a statistical technique called Mendelian Randomization which uses these genetic variants as a tool to show the causal relationship between earlier puberty and increased BMI.

Using data from 182,416 women they identified 122 genetic variants that were strongly associated with the onset of puberty - with the women's age at first period obtained via questionnaire.

Initial analysis revealed a link between these genetic variants and BMI, with those women who had variants associated with earlier puberty having an increased BMI. The researchers then tested for this same association in a third group 70,962 women, finding the same association.

Dr Gill, added, ""Some of these genetic variants are associated with earlier puberty and some with later onset, so by taking advantage of this we were able to investigate any association of age at menarche with BMI in adulthood”.

""We're not saying that it's a genetic effect, but rather that by using these genetic variants as a proxy for earlier puberty, we are able to show the effect of earlier puberty without the impact of external factors that might confound our analysis. We performed a range of statistical sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings and they remained strong through this, so within the limitations of the study design, we are confident of findings.""

According to the researchers, it remains unclear how maturing earlier has a direct impact on body weight, but they indicate that differences between physical and emotional maturity may play a role. It could be that young women who mature earlier than their peers are treated differently or have different societal pressures than girls of the same age who have not started puberty.

Another explanation could be the physical effects of hormonal changes during puberty, such as increased fat deposition in breast tissue, which when established earlier may move them to a higher risk profile for higher BMI or obesity in later life.

""It is difficult to say that changing someone's age of puberty will affect their adult risk of obesity and whether it is something that we can clinically apply - as it would unlikely be ethically appropriate to accelerate or delay the rate of puberty to affect BMI,"" added Dr Gill. ""But it is useful for us to be aware that it's a causal factor- girls who reach puberty earlier may be more likely to be overweight when they are older.""

The findings from this study are published in the International Journal of Obesity.","LONDON: Turns out, early puberty is linked to the increased risk of obesity for women.

Is ‘obesity paradox’ a paradox?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/17/is-obesity-paradox-a-paradox-1788561.html,"Saturday, March 17, 2018 09:38 AM +0530","LONDON: A study has challenged the idea that it might be possible to be overweight or obese but not at increased risk of heart disease, otherwise known as the ‘obesity paradox’.

According to the study led by the European Society of Cardiology, the risk of heart and blood vessel problems, such as heart attacks, strokes, and high blood pressure, increases as body mass index (BMI) increases beyond 22-23 kg/m2.

Furthermore, the risk also increases steadily the more fat a person carries around their waist.

The study was conducted in 296,535 adults of white European descent who are taking part in the UK Biobank study, and who were healthy at the time they enrolled in the study. UK Biobank recruited from 2006 to 2010, and follow-up data on participants were available up to 2015 for this latest analysis.

Researchers at the University of Glasgow led by Dr Stamatina Iliodromiti found that people with a BMI between 22-23 kg/m2 had the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Compared to women and men with waist circumferences of 74 and 83 cm respectively, the CVD risk increased by16 percent in women and 10 percent in men for every 12.6 cm and 11.4 cm increase in waist circumference for women and men respectively.

Similar increases in CVD risk were seen when the researchers looked at waist-to-hip and waist-to-height ratios and percentage body fat mass - all of which are considered reliable ways to accurately gauge the amount of fat a person carries, also known as adiposity.

Although it is already known that being overweight or obese increases a person's risk of CVD, as well as other diseases such as cancer, there have also been studies that have suggested that, particularly in the elderly, being overweight or even obese might not have any effect on deaths from CVD or other causes, and may even be protective, especially if people maintain a reasonable level of fitness. This is known as the ""obesity paradox"".

However, the authors of the study said their results refute these previous conflicting findings. ""Any public misconception of a potential 'protective' effect of fat on heart and stroke risks should be challenged,"" said Dr Iliodromiti.

She continued, ""This is the largest study that provides evidence against the obesity paradox in healthy people. It is possible that the story may be different for those with the pre-existing disease because there is evidence that in cancer patients, for instance, being slightly overweight is associated with lower risk, especially as cancer and its treatments can lead to unhealthy weight loss.

""By maintaining a healthy BMI of around 22-23 kg/m2, healthy people can minimise their risk of developing or dying from heart disease. In terms of other adiposity measures, the less fat, especially around their abdomen, they have, the lower the risk of future heart disease.""

However, the researchers recognise that it can be difficult for some people to maintain a BMI of 22-23 kg/m2, particularly as they get older.

Co-author, Naveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine at the University of Glasgow, said, ""We know many cannot get to such low BMIs so the message is, whatever your BMI, especially when in the overweight or obese range, losing a few kilograms or more if possible, will only improve your health. There are no downsides to losing weight intentionally and the health professions need to get better at helping people lose weight.""

The researchers say their findings may have implications for guidelines on preventing and managing cardiovascular disease.

The researchers suggest that the previous confusion over the ""obesity paradox"" may be due to many factors that can confound results of studies.

For instance, smoking changes the distribution of fat in the body, smokers may have lower weight as smoking depresses appetites and so BMI tends to be lower.

Another reason could be that some people have existing but undiagnosed disease, which can often lower their weight but also makes them more likely to die prematurely.

The findings from this study are published in the European Heart Journal.","LONDON: A study has challenged the idea that it might be possible to be overweight or obese but not at increased risk of heart disease, otherwise known as the ‘obesity paradox’.

According to the Canadian Cancer Society, NETs may not cause any signs or symptoms if they grow slowly and don’t make too much of a certain hormone.

Signs and symptoms may appear as the tumour grows or if hormones are released by the tumour - if it is a functional tumour. Other health conditions can cause the same symptoms as NETs.

The signs or symptoms of NETs vary depending on where the tumour develops in the body.

Symptoms of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours (GI NETs)

Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours (GI NETs) can develop in any part of the gastrointestinal tract, including the small or large intestine and stomach. Signs or symptoms of GI NETs may include:

- Discomfort or pain in the abdomen or rectum

- Nausea and vomiting

- Diarrhoea

- Bleeding from the rectum or blood in the stool

- Anaemia – may cause fatigue

- Heartburn or indigestion

- Stomach ulcers – can cause heartburn, indigestion, and pain in the chest or abdomen

- Weight loss

- Blockage in the intestine (bowel obstruction) – may cause pain in the abdomen or constipation

Carcinoid Syndrome

Carcinoid syndrome is a group of symptoms caused by NETs releasing large amounts of serotonin and other chemicals into the blood. Carcinoid syndrome may happen in people with any type of NET.

It most commonly occurs with NETs of the small intestine that have spread to the liver (liver metastases). The signs or symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include:

- Flushing of the skin, mainly the face and neck

- Diarrhoea

- Wheezing and difficulty breathing

- Fast or irregular heartbeat

- Low blood pressure

- Heart damage (carcinoid heart disease)

Carcinoid crisis is a severe case of flushing, low blood pressure, difficulty breathing and an irregular heartbeat. It may be triggered by anesthesia, surgery or other treatments. Carcinoid crisis is a serious and possibly life-threatening problem that needs to be treated right away. A drug called octreotide (Sandostatin) can be given to treat and reduce the risk of carcinoid crisis.

Symptoms of lung neuroendocrine tumours (lung NETs)

Lung neuroendocrine tumours (lung NETs) usually develop in the airways (bronchi). Signs or symptoms of lung NETs may include:

- A cough that doesn’t go away

- Coughing up blood

- Difficulty breathing

- Fatigue

- Pneumonia

- Carcinoid syndrome – includes flushing of the skin, diarrhea and wheezing

Cushing Syndrome

Cushing syndrome is a group of symptoms caused by too much cortisol in the body. Cushing syndrome may happen in people with NETs, including some lung NETs, when too much adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is released. This causes too much cortisol to be made by the adrenal glands.

The signs or symptoms of Cushing syndrome include:

- Weight gain

- A red, round and full face

- Muscle weakness

- Increased hair growth on the face and body

- A build-up of fat between the shoulders or above the collarbone

- Purple lines on the skin

- High blood pressure

- High blood sugar (glucose) levels

- Changes in mood and behaviour

Symptoms of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs)

Signs or symptoms of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) depend mainly on the type of hormone released by the tumour. The signs or symptoms of pNETs include:

- Low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) – may cause sweating, shakiness, dizziness, extreme hunger and problems concentrating

- High blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) – may cause extreme thirst and frequent urination, diarrhea, and fatty stools

- Stomach ulcers – may cause heartburn, indigestion, and pain in the chest or abdomen

- Weight loss

- Patches of red, itchy and painful skin

- Jaundice

- Blood clots

Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome

Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a condition caused by too much gastrin in the body. This increases the amount of stomach acid made, which can eventually lead to ulcers of the stomach or small intestine.

Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may happen in people with gastrin-producing NETs of the pancreas or small intestine (gastrinoma).

The signs or symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome include:

- Pain in the abdomen

- Severe diarrhoea

- Heartburn

- Nausea and vomiting, sometimes vomiting blood

- Weight loss","NEW DELHI: As the news of Bollywood actor Irrfan Khan being diagnosed with NeuroEndocrine Tumour (NETs) broke the internet, people have gotten curious about this rare disease.

NEW DELHI: More than 6.25 lakh children in India smoke cigarette every day, a sign of serious public health threat, a global study claimed.

According to the study -- Global Tobacco Atlas -- consumption of tobacco claims 17,887 lives in the country every week.

However, this is less than average number of deaths caused by smoking tobacco in medium Human Development Index (HDI) countries.

The report prepared by American Cancer Society (ACS) and US-based Vital Strategies claimed that the economic cost of smoking in India is Rs 18,18,691 million.

This includes direct cost related to healthcare and indirect cost involving lost productivity due to early mortality and morbidity.

Although fewer children smoke cigarette in India than on average in medium HDI nations, more than 4,29,500 boys and 1,95,500 girls in this country smoke cigarette each day, the report said and called for action from policymakers.

More than 9,03,42,900 men and 1,34,66,600 women smoke cigarettes every day, while 17,10,94,600 people use smokeless tobacco a sign of dire threat to public health, it said.

According to the report, which was released last week, 82.12 billion cigarettes were produced in India in 2016.

It said the combined revenue of the world's six largest tobacco companies in 2016 was more than USD 346 billion, which is equal to 15 per cent of the gross national income of India.

A growing body of medical evidence links inadequate sleep with anger, anxiety, and sadness.

A study on the impact of Heartfulness Meditation on insomnia brings cheer to chronic insomniacs as they stay awake to greet ‘World Sleep Day’ on March 16, 2018.

Kamlesh Patel, the fourth global guide of Heartfulness, said, “Sleep is very essential to help maintain mood, memory, and cognitive performance. Daytime alertness and memory are impaired by loss of sleep, especially when it is sustained over a few nights. For many, meditation has become a mainstream practice over the years and the study on its impact on alleviating sleep-related diseases is very encouraging.”

An ongoing research study at the WellSpan York Hospital, USA, to assess the impact of Heartfulness Meditation on insomnia, has shown promising results.

Twenty-eight participants diagnosed with chronic insomnia completed an eight-week study involving the practice of Heartfulness Meditation as an intervention to help with insomnia. The pre- and post-Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores were measured.

The mean ISI scores reduced from 20.6 to 10.8, almost by half and the result was statistically significant (p<0.001). Interestingly, some of the patients have been able to come off their pharmacological treatments as a result of the practice.

IN PICTURES: On World Sleep Day, here is all you need to know to have a good night sleep

Dr. Raja Amarnath, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, said, “In different studies, approximately 25% of adults mentioned that their sleep was not satisfactory. At least 10-15% have symptoms of sleep deprivation, negatively affecting their daytime work, while 6-10% meet the diagnostic criteria for insomnia. While the situation is quite alarming there is hope beyond medication. The results of the study on the effect of Heartfulness Meditation points towards the alleviating effect of meditation on sleep and sleep-related disorders.”

Positive effects of meditation on sleep

Medical literature supports the practice of meditation for enhancing well-being, and several studies have shown that meditation can fight insomnia and improve quality of sleep, in turn, improving health. According to the National Science Foundation in Virginia, our brain produces 50,000 thoughts per day. Ninety-five per cent of these thoughts are repetitive, restrictive, and a spiral of anxieties and worries about the past and future.

Dr. Raja Amarnath comments: “Even though the body is at rest, the mind cannot unwind. This is the fundamental cause of stress leading to sleep disturbances. Training our minds to meditate by ignoring thoughts brings us to the awareness of the present and creates a balanced state within, thereby removing stress.”

Relaxation response

During sleep, there is a reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and minute ventilation, and there is decreased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide elimination. Meditation induces similar physiological changes, except that the person remains alert although the physical body goes into a state of deep relaxation.

Enhancing melatonin

Meditation augments the synthesis of melatonin in the pineal gland, a hormone that regulates the natural sleep cycle. Stress inhibits the production of melatonin. Increased risk of breast cancer is linked to the reduction in melatonin levels due to sleep deprivation. By enhancing melatonin levels, meditation reduces this risk. Soon after beginning a meditation practice, many people have reported better quality of sleep as well as needing less sleep.

Alleviating anxiety and depression

Meditation regulates the mind, directly reducing anxiety and depression. This effect is noted in both beginners and advanced meditators. Brainwaves are stimulated in the same way during meditation, relaxation and various sleep states, including deep sleep, boosting the Alpha, Theta and Delta waves and reducing the stress-associated Beta waves.

Positive effects on ailments that affect sleep

Meditation has proven effective in the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, bronchial asthma, COPD, anxiety neurosis, depression, cancer, certain degenerative diseases and many chronic pain conditions. Sleep disturbances are common in these conditions, which are then also improved by meditation. Meditation also influences the cognitive behavioral and emotional aspects of these patients, thus improving their overall prognosis.

Meditative practices thus help to integrate the brain functions, regulate the various physiological mechanisms resulting in a state of mental, emotional and physical well-being.

The path of the heart: Heartfulness enhances sleep quality

Heartfulness Meditation is a simple heart-based meditation practice that helps with stress, burnout and emotional wellness. The simplified Raja Yoga meditation techniques of Heartfulness are designed to suit our modern-day hectic world, and are effective in improving sleep and quality of life when practiced regularly.

In Heartfulness Meditation, we rest the mind on the heart with one single thought, ignoring all other thoughts as uninvited guests. Regular practice of this very act trains the mind to pursue only necessary thoughts and ignore all unwanted ones. This results in true regulation of the mind, where the mind is guided by the heart and unwanted thoughts are reduced.

When we are stressed, it takes longer to fall asleep and often it is disturbed sleep. In deep meditation on the heart, we dive deep into the finer layers of consciousness, physical awareness is lost, and we are less affected by thoughts, emotions and stress. Sleep can be instantaneous, deep and undisturbed for a balanced mind that is trained through regular meditation.","A study on the impact of Heartfulness Meditation on insomnia brings cheer to chronic insomniacs as they stay awake to greet ‘World Sleep Day’ on March 16, 2018.
Twenty-eight participants diagnosed with chronic insomnia completed an eight-week study involving the practice of Heartfulness Meditation as an intervention to help with insomnia.
Soon after beginning a meditation practice, many people have reported better quality of sleep as well as needing less sleep.
Brainwaves are stimulated in the same way during meditation, relaxation and various sleep states, including deep sleep, boosting the Alpha, Theta and Delta waves and reducing the stress-associated Beta waves.

I really look up to Akshay Kumar: Saiyami Kher,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/16/i-really-look-up-to-akshay-kumar-saiyami-kher-1788028.html,"Friday, March 16, 2018 08:26 AM +0530","MUMBAI: ""Mirzya"" actress Saiyami Kher, a sports and fitness enthusiast, says she finds actor Akshay Kumar inspirational.



While fitness is a way of life for Saiyami, who has played badminton and cricket professionally, she says it's not necessarily a decisive factor for a career as an actor in the entertainment industry.



""Looks and glamour are one part of the entertainment industry, but if you have a six-pack, it doesn't mean that you're a good actor. If you are doing an action film, you will need to physically look like an action hero. That's when the physicality comes in; but to be an actor, body type is not important.



""What's important is how you act and if the character requires you to have a particular kind of a body, then one has to work on that,"" Saiyami told IANS.



She cited the examples of Bhumi Pednekar who first gained weight for ""Dum Laga Ke Haisha"" and then lost it for her subsequent projects, Randeep Hooda who went through drastic weight loss for ""Sarbjit"" and Aamir Khan who went through weight fluctuations for ""Dangal"".



""With regards to fitness, you definitely need to remain very fit because if you are fit, you will get to do more work. But in the entertainment industry, I don't think that's the only focus because obviously acting always remains the main focus.



""I really look up to Akshay Kumar. He is tremendously fit and an inspiration.""



Saiyami, along with Anusha Dandekar, was in Lavasa, near Pune for the launch of adidas Ultra Boost X, attended by around 50 women from different walks of life last week. After a yoga session on day one, they indulged in a challenging 5K uphill run.



Running is Saiyami's go-to way of staying fit, but she believes ""fitness is completely in your mind"".



She hopes people, especially women, stop giving excuses to not workout.



""I understand that it's very difficult to run a family, to have children, but at the same time, there's always a way to find solutions. I urge all women to take out time for themselves and stay fit and make fitness an integral part of their life.""



What's next on the work front?

The conundrum of being shatteringly tired before bed, yet not able to sleep off, is not unheard of.

Now it has been revealed that it is incredibly simple to doze off, as soon as your head hit the pillow – all you need to do is, write a very specific to-do list.

Yes, it seems unbelievable but a study has explained that writing down the tasks you need to do the next day will help calm your brain and make you relax.

The study stated that one of the main reasons people lie awake at night is because they worry about things they need to perform the next day.

“We live in a 24/7 culture in which our to-do lists seem to be constantly growing and causing us to worry about unfinished tasks at bedtime,” said lead study author Dr Michael K Scullin, as quoted by The Independent.

“Most people just cycle through their to-do lists in their heads, and so we wanted to explore whether the act of writing them down could counteract nighttime difficulties with falling asleep.”

According to a study, spending five minutes writing a to-do list could be all it takes to fall asleep faster.

However, the researchers also found that journaling - i.e. writing about the things you’ve already done - doesn’t have the same effect.

Some participants in the study were tasked with writing a to-do list, whereas others were asked to write a completed list. And the researchers found that the former group fell asleep “significantly faster” than the latter.

The results were measured in a sleep lab where participants’ electrical brain activity was monitored overnight.

It was found that the more specific the to-do list was, the quicker people fell asleep.

The findings are published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology.","LONDON: Experts have come up with a trick to do before bed to ultimately help you doze off faster.

Twenty-eight participants diagnosed with chronic insomnia completed an eight-week study involving the practice of ""Heartfulness Meditation"" as an intervention to help with insomnia. The pre- and post-Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores were measured.



""The mean ISI scores reduced almost by half. Interestingly, some patients were able to come off their pharmacological treatments as a result of the practice,"" the study claimed.



""Heartfulness Meditation"" is a simple heart-based meditation practice that helps with stress, burnout and emotional wellness.



The simplified Raja Yoga meditation techniques of ""Heartfulness"" are designed to suit modern-day hectic lifestyle and are effective in improving sleep and quality of life when practised regularly.



Over a million people in 130 countries are estimated to be practising ""Heartfulness Meditation"".



Daaji (Kamlesh Patel), the fourth global guide of ""Heartfulness"", believes sleep is essential to help maintain mood, memory and cognitive performance.



""Daytime alertness and memory are impaired by loss of sleep, especially when it is sustained over a few nights. For many, meditation has become a mainstream practice over the years and the study on its impact on alleviating sleep-related diseases is very encouraging,"" he said.



A growing body of medical evidence links inadequate sleep with anger, anxiety and sadness. A significant proportion of the adult population suffers from sleep problems and many of them potentially have chronic insomnia.



Treatment options include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures. Pharmacological treatments may be associated with significant adverse effects.



In different studies, approximately 25 per cent of adults mentioned that their sleep was not satisfactory. At least 10-15 per cent have symptoms of sleep deprivation, negatively affecting their daytime work, while 6-10 per cent meet the diagnostic criteria for insomnia.



""While the situation is quite alarming, there is hope beyond medication. The results of the study on the effect of 'Heartfulness Meditation' points towards the alleviating effect of meditation on sleep and sleep-related disorders,"" said Raja Amarnath, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals, Chennai.



Chronic shortening of sleep time results in circadian rhythm disorders.



Sleep problems are also prevalent among children and teenagers due to the availability of computer games, Internet and television. Studies show that this has resulted in obesity, cognitive impairment and emotional disturbances.



In adults, sleep disturbances lead to a wide range of health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, anxiety, depression, early aging, alcoholism and other substance abuse.



Chronic sleep restriction among many individuals may eventually impact society in terms of loss in productivity and increased health costs.



Several studies have shown that meditation can fight insomnia and improve quality of sleep, in turn, improving health.



According to the National Science Foundation in Virginia, our brain produces 50,000 thoughts per day. Ninety-five per cent of these thoughts are repetitive, restrictive, and a spiral of anxieties and worries about the past and future.



During sleep, there is a reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and minute ventilation, and there is decreased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide elimination. Meditation induces similar physiological changes, except that the person remains alert although the physical body goes into a state of deep relaxation.



Meditation augments the synthesis of melatonin in the pineal gland, a hormone that regulates the natural sleep cycle. Stress inhibits the production of melatonin.



Meditation regulates the mind, directly reducing anxiety and depression. This effect is noted in both beginners and advanced meditators.","Twenty-eight participants diagnosed with chronic insomnia completed an eight-week study involving the practice of ""Heartfulness Meditation"" as an intervention to help with insomnia.

Suffering from hair loss? Here's all you need to know to get back healthy and voluminous tresses,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/14/suffering-from-hair-loss-heres-all-you-need-to-know-to-get-back-healthy-and-voluminous-tresses-1786941.html,"Thursday, March 15, 2018 07:44 AM +0530","NEW DELHI: You feel great when your hair is healthy and voluminous. But, if it's not, you may end up feeling a bit low.

Hair loss or thinning is quite common amongst women as also. It’s not just women in their forties or fifties who face hair loss, it can also strike a younger lot.

“Most cases of increased hair shedding gradually resolve on their own without treatment. But, if your hair doesn’t return to its normal fullness after 6 to 9 months, then you may require hair treatments,” said Prerna Taneja, Medical Director Clinic Eximus.

Listed below are some of the most common causes of hair loss in women:

Emotional or physical stress: When you’re going through a stressful phase, you may experience hair loss as your body puts its resources towards getting you through that sad event. Also, overexerting yourself physically can also result in losing strands.

Pollution: Sudden hair loss is imminent if the contaminants of air, including particulate matter, dust, smoke, nickel, lead and arsenic, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons settle on your scalp and hair.

Poor diet: In order to be in their best shape, women these days indulge into dieting, which on the flip side can lead to lack of nutrition in their body, resulting in massive hair loss.

Lack of sleep: Not having enough sleep can also cause and thin down your tuft.

Lack of protein: Intake of nutrients, like protein, is essential as it helps make new hair cells. But, if your body doesn’t have enough of it, it won’t be able to replace your old hairs with the new ones.

Changes in birth control pill: Going off the pill or changing to a different type of hormonal contraception is also one of the causes of hair loss in women.

Pregnancy: Owing to the estrogen hormones, women during pregnancy notice their hair going into rapid growth mode. But, once estrogen levels go back to normal after delivery, hair starts shredding again.

The continuous styling of hair or wearing too tight hairstyles: Rigorous styling and hair treatments over the years can thin the bunch on your head. Constant application of chemicals on hair weaken their roots. Wearing too tight ponytails is also one of the causes of hair loss among women.

Anemia: Almost two in 10 women between 20 and 50 years of age suffer from iron deficiency, which is an easily fixable cause of hair loss.

Hormonal changes: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) symbolises imbalance in female sex hormones. An excess of androgens results in ovarian cysts, a higher risk of diabetes, changes in menstrual period, which ultimately affects the hair growth. Hypothyroidism is another big reason for hair loss.

Heredity: If your family trend has always been in a way where women suffer from hair loss at a certain age, then you might be more prone to the same.

Here are some treatments for hair loss:

Mesotherapy: It involves imparting a combination of various nutrients and medication that boosts hair growth naturally.

Platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP): In this treatment, the patient’s blood is drawn and is then processed. The platelet-rich blood is inserted via an injection into the problem areas of skin to organically support hair growth.

Hair transplant: This treatment restores hair by transplanting new follicles into balding or thinning areas. Healthy follicles are taken from other areas of the body; mostly the back or the sides of the head.","It’s not just women in their forties or fifties who face hair loss, it can also strike a younger lot.

Researchers from Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine analysed data from annual health checkups, which included audio testing performed by a technician and a health-related lifestyle questionnaire completed by each participant.

They examined the effects of smoking status (current, former, and never smokers), the number of cigarettes smoked per day, and the duration of smoking cessation on the extent of hearing loss.

Even after adjusting for factors including occupational noise exposure, researchers noted a 1.2 to 1.6 increased risk of hearing loss among current smokers compared with never smokers.

While the association between smoking and high-frequency hearing loss was stronger than that of low-frequency hearing loss, the risk of both high- and low-frequency hearing loss increased with cigarette consumption.

The increased risk of hearing loss decreased within five years after quitting smoking.

""With a large sample size, long follow-up period, and objective assessment of hearing loss, our study provides strong evidence that smoking is an independent risk factor of hearing loss,"" said Huanhuan Hu of Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine.

""These results provide strong evidence to support that smoking is a causal factor for hearing loss and emphasize the need for tobacco control to prevent or delay the development of hearing loss,"" said Hu lead author of the study published in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research.","TOKYO: Smoking may significantly increase the risk of hearing loss, a study of more than 50,000 participants over 8 years has found.

Are you expecting a baby soon? Here's how sleeping better helps,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/14/are-you-expecting-a-baby-soon-heres-how-sleeping-better-helps-1786999.html,"Wednesday, March 14, 2018 01:26 PM +0530","NEW DELHI: From glowing with the excitement of a life growing inside to the amount of pampering experienced by expectant mothers, the duration of pregnancy is often said to be one of the most exhilarating experiences a woman can have. However, apart from receiving the care showered by others, expectant mothers should be careful about getting perfect sleep too.



Sleep is a significant aspect that plays a crucial role in the health of the mother and baby.



Ankit Garg, Co-founder and CEO of Wakefit.co and Devrath Vijay, Founder of the functional training studio, The Outfit, outline a few ways through which expecting mothers can ensure they get a good night's sleep in the most comfortable manner to ensure that the baby growing inside gets its share of much-needed, peaceful slumber.



* Watch your diet: It is said that what we eat before going to sleep has an immense impact on how well we doze off. Pregnant mothers should ideally eat light during dinner, and avoid acidic, oil-rich or fatty foods. Additionally, they should ensure that there is at least an hour's gap between their finishing dinner and going to sleep. Furthermore, it is not ideal to directly go into a resting position after eating and pregnant women should ideally take a short walk before going to sleep.



* Identify a comfortable position: With a protruding belly, it can become difficult to find a comfortable sleeping position. As per some reports, it is suggested that pregnant women start sleeping on their left side, as it increases the amount of blood and nutrients that reach the baby. From the third trimester onwards, women should practice sleeping on the left side and not on their backs as the weight of the baby can compress the mother's major blood vessels.



* Choose the perfect mattress: It is essential for pregnant women to sleep in a bed that is comfortable and has a clean, comfortable and sturdy mattress. Recently, various modern-day mattress innovators such as Wakefit have brought about a revolution of sorts in the mattress industry by introducing a unique offering called memory foam mattresses. These mattresses can adjust themselves according to the body contours of the sleeper, thereby giving a feeling of being cocooned in a cozy space for that ultimate sleep.



* Cut down on fluid intake during night: It is an oft-repeated advice to ensure the undisturbed sleep of pregnant mothers is not broken by repeated visits to the bathroom. Also, keeping perfumed potpourri or soap, scented candles etc, near the bed helps to tide over those pressing bouts of nausea.



* Consume light, happy content: Reading gory books before bed-time or watching extremely tense, edge-of-the-seat thrillers before sleep can often have a negative impact on the body. It is advised that pregnant mothers should start slowing down 1.5-2 hours prior to sleeping and listen to mellow songs, take a relaxing bath or read/watch light and uplifting content in books or TV shows.

As per a study led by a Rutgers University-New Brunswick professor, the promotion of a select group of gut bacteria by a diet high in diverse fibers could led to better blood glucose control, greater weight loss and better lipid levels in people with type 2 diabetes, reported Science Daily.

After a rigorous study of six years, it was found out at eating the right dietary fibers could rebalance the gut microbiota or the ecosystem of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract that would eventually help digest food and are important for human health.

Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose to enter the cells, which provides energy.

Many bacteria break down carbohydrates, in the gut and produce short-chain fatty acid, which provides nourishment to the gut lining, reduce inflammation and help to control the appetite.

The shortage of short-chain fatty acids leads to the type 2 diabetes and other diseases.

As per several studies increase in dietary fiber intake could lessen type 2 diabetes.

However, the thirst remains unquenched. Doctors say such drinks do not replenish electrolyte levels in body, which is needed for muscle and nerve coordination.

When people feel thirsty after going out in hot sun and feel thirsty, doctors suggested people to take plain water, natural fruit juices, butter milk or coconut water. On March 10, highest temeprature of 38 degrees was recorded in Bhadrachalam and it was 36 degrees in Hyderabad. The temperatures are expected to tough 46 degrees in the State. When people go out in sun, along with water, electrolytes too are lost.

“Aerated drinks or alcoholic drinks do not have electrolytes, loss of which causes muscle cramps and exhaustion,” said Dr N Goverdhan, consultant physician, CARE Hospitals. Electrolytes, which helps in nerve and muscle conduction, includes sodium and potassium. Low or excess levels of sodium is not good for body. The consultant physician said that zero levels of Sodium causes drowsiness and low levels of Potassium causes rhythm disturbances in Heart.

Head of Nephrology department at Osmania General Hospital, Dr Manisha Sahay said that aerated drinks contain high levels of sodium which depletes water from cells which leads to cell damage.

“They also contain caffeine which is a diuretic-auses urination and thus more water is lost. Also, aerated drinks contain phosphoric acid which depletes calcium from bones and leads to Osteoporosis,” Dr Manisha Sahay said.

Besides loss of water and chemicals from the body, the aerated drinks and beer increases body weight.

At the recently conducted educative programme on World Kidney Day, at the MMM Hospital, Mogappair, Rajalaskhmi Ravi, Head of Awareness and Prevention, Tamilnad Kidney Research (TANKER) Foundation, said they focussed on kidney disease for women this year. Since 1993, they have been working to provide healthcare, research, training, and advocacy on kidney disease.

Initiating the programme, Dr Georgi Abraham, founder trustee, TANKER Foundation, said, “The foundation conducts programmes and screenings across corporate offices, colleges and in their clinic every day to create awareness.”

Nephrologists, Dr N Gopalakrishnan and Dr S Suresh, also presided over the event, sharing statistics and answering queries about kidney disease. “The biggest reason for kidney disease is diabetes and high blood pressure. Another major kidney disease affecting women is lupus, an autoimmune disease. For every 13 women diagnosed with lupus, only one man gets it,” said Dr Gopalakrishnan. He also shared that the absence of decent restrooms for women makes most avoid drinking water, causing dehydration. “This leads to kidney stress, and sometimes urinary tract infections which, when left unchecked, can cause kidney failure,” he warned.

For early diagnosis of kidney disease, one must go for frequent screening, control diabetes and blood pressure, avoid unauthorised medications, and control alcohol and tobacco abuse. “Earlier, screening was mandatory when you hit 30. Now we have kept 20 as the limit, because of all the lifestyle modifications,” said Rajalaskhmi.

Jayashree Lakshminarayanan, art director, was the chief guest. Patients and families, technicians, attendees and the general public benefitted from the event.

Toxic water of Hyderabad damaging health!,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/12/toxic-water-of-hyderabad-damaging-health-1785764.html,"Monday, March 12, 2018 09:33 AM +0530","HYDERABAD: What are the health problems that arise out of drinking water contaminated with pollutants? Well, there aren’t many epidemiological studies to understand the impacts. A study that was published recently, conducted at Nacharam in Hyderabad, highlights the need for epidemiological studies to understand the burden of waterborne diseases in the State.

The study, conducted by researchers from St. Pious X Degree and PG College for Women, surveyed 363 people residing in areas like Indira Nagar, Errakunta, Ambedkar Nagar and Erkala Basthi in Nacharam. Many of them reported various health problems. For instance, 39 per cent of them reported hair loss, 10 per cent had skin rashes, 8 per cent had tooth decay, 6 per cent diarrhoea and 4 per cent had joint pains.

The findings on health problems was correlated with findings on contamination levels of piped water supplied by government and pollution levels of ground and surface water in those areas. Researchers found that piped water supplied by government in Nacharam had several contaminants —a wide range of fungus species like Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Fusarium and Drechslera.

Another study conducted in 2016 by Institute of Preventive Medicine reported presence of fecal coliforms in the water. While not all forms of fungi cause health problems in humans, Aspergillus causes serious infections on the skin and even in organs inside the human body, especially among people who already have weak immunity suffering due to some disease.

Testing of surface and groundwater by researchers revealed the presence of high amounts of heavy metals like Hexavalent Chromium, Cadmium, Lead and Nickel. A study published last year, conducted by researchers from JNTU reported the presence of Arsenic, Rubidium, Barium, Molybdenum, Chromium, Zirconium, Aluminium and even Lead in high amounts in the soil and groundwater of Nacharam.

Ingestion of these heavy metals is known to cause a variety of health issues, including those mentioned by respondents who were interviewed by the researchers. More dangerous health complications, however, are cancer and neurological development of children. When contacted, Dr Mala Das Sharma, head of chemistry department at St Pious X college who authored the research paper with Padmalatha P of biotechnology department, said, “Water in Hyderabad is highly polluted, as it was observed in studies conducted by us and in earlier studies as well. It will prove helpful if a city-wide such epidemiological is undertaken by government to understand its burden on public health in the city.”

Pregnant diabetic women to get tablets instead of insulin jabs in Karnataka,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/12/pregnant-diabetic-women-to-get-tablets-instead-of-insulin-jabs-in-karnataka-1785688.html,"Monday, March 12, 2018 09:01 AM +0530","BENGALURU: With approximately one lakh pregnant women in the state being diabetic, the state health authorities are planning to put them on metformin tablets to manage the condition.

Dr Rajkumar N, Maternal Health programme officer said, “With insulin injections, there is a risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar, the body’s main source of energy). There is also the problem of preservation and technique of administering it that the healthcare provider has to be trained in. So, administering metformin tablets is easier.”

Henceforth, when any pregnant woman in the state comes for her first ante-natal check-up, she will be given oral glucose tolerance test where she is given 75 gm of glucose and her blood sugar levels will be tested two hours after that. If it is greater than 140 mg/dL, she will be given medical nutrition therapy for 15 days and if the blood sugar levels are still not back to normal, she will be given metformin tablets.

Medical nutrition therapy involves a carbohydrate-controlled balanced meal plan which promotes adequate energy for appropriate gestational weight gain.

The Union health ministry, on February 28, came out with revised technical and operational guidelines on diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) under which pregnant women will be mandatorily screened for diabetes and given metformin tablet instead of insulin injections.

Guidelines advocate that if the first test is negative, second test should be done at 24-28 weeks of gestation. In the post-partum period, oral glucose tolerance test should be repeated at six weeks after delivery, if blood sugar is less than 140 mg/dL, then women are referred to non-communicable disease clinic for blood sugar testing annually.

“It is important to ensure second test as many pregnant women develop blood sugar tolerance during 24-28 weeks period. Only one-third of gestational diabetes mellitus-positive women are detected during first trimester,” Rajkumar said.

Maternal risks of GDM include polyhydramnios, pre-eclampsia, prolonged labour, obstructed labour, cesarean section, uterine atony, post-partum hemorrhage, infection and progression of retinopathy which are the leading global causes of maternal morbidity and mortality.

Fetal risks include spontaneous abortion, intra-uterine death, stillbirth, congenital malformation, shoulder dystocia, birth injuries and infant respiratory distress syndrome.","BENGALURU: With approximately one lakh pregnant women in the state being diabetic, the state health authorities are planning to put them on metformin tablets to manage the condition.

Thirdhand smoke is a kind of toxic residue that lingers on indoor surfaces and in the dust long after a cigarette has been extinguished, which was already regarded as a health hazard nearly 10 years ago.



The study conducted on mice showed an increased incidence of lung cancer, larger tumours and a greater number of tumours, compared with control mice.



Exposure to thirdhand smoke can occur via inhalation, ingestion or absorption through the skin, the Xinhua reported.



""Thirdhand smoke causes hidden risks of tobacco smoking. You cannot see it, but you can smell it,"" said Bo Hang, a staff scientist at US Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab).



For the study, appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine, the team housed a cohort of 24 mice with scraps of fabric impregnated with thirdhand smoke from the age of four to seven weeks.



They received a dose of an estimated 77 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day.



Brief exposure to thirdhand smoke was associated with low body weight and immune changes in juvenile mice, the results showed.



Field studies have confirmed that the presence of thirdhand smoke in indoor environments is widespread, and traditional cleaning methods are not effective for removing it.



Young children are most likely to suffer from thirdhand smoke, Hang was quoted as telling Xinhua.



""Young kids who crawl and put objects in their mouths are more likely to come in contact with contaminated surfaces, and are therefore the most vulnerable to thirdhand smoke's harmful effects,"" Hang explained.



The most significant progress made in the study of THS is that the long-term effects of THS are determined to be linked to human cancers, Mao, a geneticist senior staff scientist at Berkeley Lab, told Xinhua.

Heart failure is a life-threatening condition affecting an estimated 23 million people worldwide.



Vitamin D prevents excessive scarring and thickening of heart tissue following a heart attack, which may help reduce the risk of heart failure.



""This is a problem because scarring of heart tissue can reduce the heart's ability to pump blood effectively, which can lead to heart failure,"" said James Chong, Associate Professor at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research in Australia.



For the study, published in the journal Heart Lung and Circulation, researchers used mouse models to investigate the impact of 1,25D -- a form of Vitamin D that interacts with hormones -- on the cardiac colony-forming unit fibroblasts (cCFU-Fs)cells that form scar tissue after a heart attack.



Heart attacks occur when blood supply to the heart is blocked, leading to tissue damage. This triggers an inflammatory response where the cCFU-Fs replace the damaged tissue with collagen-based scar tissue.



""Our research shows that vitamin D actually blocks the cCFU-Fs from forming scar tissue. By blocking cCFU-Fs, vitamin D may play an important role in lowering the risk of heart failure after a heart attack,"" Chong said.

While cardiovascular diseases are generally considered a man's issue, globally, they claim more lives of women than men.

In regards to women, symptoms become more evident after the onset of menopause.

Highlighting the risk factors causing the increase in risk of cardiovascular health in women, Dr Manjiri Mehta Consultant Gynecologist, Obstetrician, Laparoscopic surgeon, Hiranandani Hospital Vashi- A Fortis Network Hospital said, ""Menopause does not cause cardiovascular disease per say; however certain risk factors at the time of menopause like a high-fat diet, early age smoking etc. certainly take a toll on one's cardiovascular health. The reason why menopause is the center of the discussion here is because during the time of menopause, the body goes through hormonal havoc.""

• Estrogen levels play a role

A decline in the natural hormone-estrogen is a factor when it comes to decline in cardiovascular health in post-menopausal women. Estrogen has always been believed to play a pivotal role in the positive effect on the inner layer of the arterial walls. These hormones considerably reduce the risk of stroke in women. However, several studies about the various other factors causing the decline in cardiovascular health are still under different stages of research.

• Cardiovascular health history

Being an ardent follower of a healthy lifestyle and continuing the same during menopause, considerably reduces the risk of a heart disease or a stroke. A person with a history of cardiovascular diseases running in the family is at a heightened risk. Given the increased risk, a person should be vary of their cardiovascular health and take adequate precautions.

• After menopause, there is a risk of increase in cardiac disease as the protection offered by estrogen declines. At the age of 50, more than 50% of the deaths occur in women due to problems related to cardiac health. Further complications are basically worsening of cardiac function and dip in the quality of life.

• Generally, women who frequently smoke are diabetic and hypertensive or have a family history of these along with bad cholesterol. Thus, they are at a higher risk of having cardiac disease post-menopause.

• The falling levels of estrogen impact the bones too, apart from the heart. The bones might become thin and prone to fractures.

• The risk factors of cardiac disease are stroke, thrombosis in veins and thinning of bones, amongst post-menopausal women.

• As per recommendations, women in their late 40s and early 50s should be following a dietary pattern that is rich in:

Carbohydrates and proteins.

- A meal comprising of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, nuts are necessary for a healthy heart.

- Physical activity for at least an hour is must to keep the risk of cardiovascular diseases at bay.

Exercise regularly to slow down aging,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/10/exercise-regularly-to-slow-down-aging-1784943.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 10:29 AM +0530","WASHINGTON: Here's a hack to slowdown your age clock!

According to a study, a lifetime of regular exercise can delay aging.

The researchers at the University of Birmingham and King's College London set out to assess the health of older adults who had exercised most of their adult lives to see if this could slow down aging.

The study recruited 125 amateur cyclists aged 55 to 79, 84 of which were male and 41 were female. The men had to be able to cycle 100 km in under 6.5 hours, while the women had to be able to cycle 60 km in 5.5 hours.

Smokers, heavy drinkers and those with high blood pressure or other health conditions were excluded from the study.

The participants underwent a series of tests in the laboratory and were compared to a group of adults who do not partake in regular physical activity. This group consisted of 75 healthy people aged 57 to 80 and 55 healthy young adults aged 20 to 36.

The study showed that loss of muscle mass and strength did not occur in those who exercise regularly. The cyclists also did not increase their body fat or cholesterol levels with age and the men's testosterone levels also remained high, suggesting that they may have avoided most of the male menopause.

More surprisingly, the study also revealed that the benefits of exercise extend beyond muscle as the cyclists also had an immune system that did not seem to have aged either.

An organ called the thymus, which makes immune cells called T cells, starts to shrink from the age of 20 and makes less T cells. In this study, however, the cyclists' thymuses were making as many T cells as those of a young person.

The findings come as figures show that less than half of over 65s do enough exercise to stay healthy and more than half of those aged over 65 suffer from at least two diseases.

Professor Janet Lord, Director of the Institute of Inflammation and Ageing at the University of Birmingham, said: ""Hippocrates in 400 BC said that exercise is man's best medicine, but his message has been lost over time and we are an increasingly sedentary society.

""However, importantly, our findings debunk the assumption that ageing automatically makes us more frail.

""Our research means we now have strong evidence that encouraging people to commit to regular exercise throughout their lives is a viable solution to the problem that we are living longer but not healthier.""

Dr Niharika Arora Duggal, also of the University of Birmingham, said: ""We hope these findings prevent the danger that, as a society, we accept that old age and disease are normal bedfellows and that the third age of man is something to be endured and not enjoyed.""

Professor Stephen Harridge, Director of the Centre of Human & Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King's College London, said: ""The findings emphasise the fact that the cyclists do not exercise because they are healthy, but that they are healthy because they have been exercising for such a large proportion of their lives.

""Their bodies have been allowed to age optimally, free from the problems usually caused by inactivity. Remove the activity and their health would likely deteriorate.""

Norman Lazarus, Emeritus Professor at King's College London and also a master cyclist and Dr Ross Pollock, who undertook the muscle study, both agreed that: ""Most of us who exercise have nowhere near the physiological capacities of elite athletes.

""We exercise mainly to enjoy ourselves. Nearly everybody can partake in an exercise that is in keeping with their own physiological capabilities.

""Find an exercise that you enjoy in whatever environment that suits you and make a habit of physical activity. You will reap the rewards in later life by enjoying an independent and productive old age.""

The findings have been published in the journal Aging Cell.","According to a study, a lifetime of regular exercise can delay aging.

Women regret one-night stands less when they take the initiative,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/09/women-regret-one-night-stands-less-when-they-take-the-initiative-1784484.html,"Friday, March 9, 2018 03:10 PM +0530","LONDON: Women regret short-term sexual encounters like one-night stands less when they take the initiative and also enjoy the act, a study says.



Men regret casual sex much less overall than women do, although it does happen, said the study published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.



""The factor that clearly distinguishes women from men is the extent to which they themselves take the initiative,"" said one of the researchers Mons Bendixen, Associate Professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).



In contrast to women, sexual regret for men was not found to be affected by whether they took the initiative.



""Women who initiate sex are likely to have at least two distinguishing qualities,"" said Professor David Buss from the University of Texas at Austin in the US.



""First, they are likely to have a healthy sexual psychology, being maximally comfortable with their own sexuality. Second, women who initiate have maximum choice of precisely who they want to have sex with. Consequently, they have less reason to feel regret, since they've made their own choice,"" Buss added.



While initiative is the clearest gender-differentiating factor for regret after casual sex, other conditions can also affect how much an individual regrets the encounter.



""Women feel less regret if the partner was skilled and they felt sexually satisfied,"" said Leif Edvard Ottesen Kennair, Professor at NTNU.



But these effects are not as strong in men, Bendixen said.



""Women have less regret if the sex was good. For men, this also plays a less important role. The underlying causes are biological,"" Bendixen said.



Women also feel disgust more often than men after a short-term sexual encounter. This is a key factor in whether or not they feel regret, the study said.



""The feeling of disgust or revulsion is the single factor that best explained why women and men regretted the last time they had casual sex when we controlled for all other factors,"" Bendixen said.



People may feel disgust because they feel moral regret, but also if the act is unhygienic or if the sex itself was perceived as gross.



For the study, the researchers analysed responses from 547 Norwegian and 216 American students.



The nationality and possible cultural aspects of the responses did not seem to play much of a role, the researchers said.","LONDON: Women regret short-term sexual encounters like one-night stands less when they take the initiative and also enjoy the act, a study says.

In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath that covers nerve fibres and causes communication problems between the brain and the rest of your body. Ultimately, the disease can cause the nerves themselves to deteriorate or become permanently damaged, according to the Mayo Clinic in the US.

The findings published in the journal Neurology suggest that adequate exposure to the Sun in childhood and young adulthood may especially be beneficial in terms of reduced MS risk.

While ultraviolet B (UV-B) rays from the Sun can cause sunburn and play a role in the development of skin cancer, they also help the body produce vitamin D.

Lower levels of vitamin D have been linked to an increased risk of MS.

""We found that where a person lives and the ages at which they are exposed to the Sun's UV-B rays may play important roles in reducing the risk of MS,"" said study author Helen Tremlett of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

The study involved 151 women with MS and 235 women of similar age without MS.

Participants lived across the US in a variety of climates and locations. Of those with MS, the average age at onset was 40. All of the women had completed questionnaires about summer, winter and lifetime Sun exposure.

The researchers found that women who lived in sunnier climates with the highest exposure to UV-B rays had 45 per cent reduced risk of developing M.

When looking at specific age groups, those who lived in areas with the highest levels of UV-B rays between ages 5 to 15 had a 51 per cent reduced risk of MS compared to the lowest group.

In addition, those who spent more time outdoors in the summer at ages 5 to 15 in locations where exposure to UV-B rays was the highest had a 55 per cent reduced risk of developing the disease compared to those in the lowest-exposure group.

""Our findings suggest that a higher exposure to the Sun's UV-B rays, higher summer outdoor exposure and lower risk of MS can occur not just in childhood, but into early adulthood as well,"" said Tremlett.

The figures indicated that 80 per cent of people displaced by climate change are women, reports the BBC.

Roles as primary caregivers and providers of food and fuel make them more vulnerable when flooding and drought occur.

The 2015 Paris Agreement has made specific provision for the empowerment of women, recognising that they are disproportionately impacted.

In central Africa, where up to 90 per cent of Lake Chad has disappeared, nomadic indigenous groups are particularly at risk. As the lake's shoreline recedes, women have to walk much further to collect water.

""In the dry season, men go to the towns leaving women to look after the community,"" Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, coordinator of the Association of Indigenous Women and People of Chad (AFPAT), told the BBC.

With dry seasons now becoming longer, women are working harder to feed and care for their families without support.

""They become more vulnerable... It's very hard work,"" Ibrahim added.

In the immediate aftermath of extreme events, emergency shelters can be inadequately equipped to support women, the UN revealed.

The Superdome, in which evacuees were temporarily housed after Hurricane Katrina, did not have enough sanitary products for the women accommodated there.

The UN has highlighted the need for gender sensitive responses to the impacts of climate change, yet the average representation of women in national and global climate negotiating bodies is below 30 per cent.

Another study spanning 20 years noted that catastrophic events lowered women's life expectancy more than men; more women were being killed, or they were being killed younger. In countries where women had greater socioeconomic power, the difference reduced.","UNITED NATIONS: Women are more likely than men to be affected by climate change, UN figures revealed on Thursday.

World Kidney Day | IMA says kidney-related diseases almost doubled in past decade,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/08/world-kidney-day--ima-says-kidney-related-diseases-almost-doubled-in-past-decade-1784088.html,"Thursday, March 8, 2018 08:58 PM +0530","NEW DELHI: On World Kidney Day today, the IMA said the prevalence of kidney-related diseases has almost doubled in the past decade and is expected to rise further.

IMA General Secretary R N Tandon said the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in urban adult population has risen to 20 per cent as per the Indian Council of Medical Research data.

""With rising prevalence of various lifestyle diseases in India, prevalence of kidney disease has also almost doubled in the last decade and is expected to rise further,"" Tandon said.

""Besides the large and ever growing burden of non-communicable diseases (diabetes and hypertension), various people are affected by kidney diseases due to over-the-counter drugs and traditional medicines containing heavy metals which harm the kidneys,"" the IMA general secretary said.

On this World Kidney Day, which coincides with the International Women's Day, the IMA said it wishes to bring the focus back on kidney health and emphasises the important role played by women in the health of their family and the society.

The risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) is at least as high in women as in men, and may even be higher.

However, the number of women on dialysis in India is lower than the number of men, Tandon said.

The IMA launched a Kidney Disease Prevention project today, as part of which screening and awareness drives will be organised to identify the population at risk.

Garima Aggarwal, the convener of the project, said: ""Every year pregnancy-related kidney diseases account for a major cause of maternal mortality in our country.

The burden of chronic kidney diseases in India is approximately 800 affected per million people (pmp) with 230 pmp with advanced kidney disease needing some form of renal replacement therapy in the form of dialysis or renal transplantation.

""It is clear that treatment of kidney disease and its advanced stage end stage renal disease is expensive and beyond the reach of average Indian.

Thus, it is crucial that prevention of chronic kidney disease has to be the goal of the medical fraternity, government of India and the general public,"" Aggarwal said.","NEW DELHI: On World Kidney Day today, the IMA said the prevalence of kidney-related diseases has almost doubled in the past decade and is expected to rise further.

Government puts up National Rare Disease Policy in place, allocates Rs 100 crore towards genetic disorders,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/08/government-puts-up-national-rare-disease-policy-in-place-allocates-rs-100-crore-towards-genetic-dis-1783938.html,"Thursday, March 8, 2018 12:08 PM +0530","NEW DELHI: Rare diseases, which are often referred to as orphan diseases, are estimated to have impacted 72-96 million people in India. The Indian government has now put a National Rare Disease Policy in place and Rs 100 crore funds have been allocated towards genetic disorders.

Under the policy, the Central government will contribute 60 percent towards spending on treatment, while state governments will have to bear the remaining 40 percent of the cost. The government’s effort to improve diagnosis and bring better treatment and care to patients is already in progress, building on existing capabilities.

Disorders such as Thalassemia, Hemophilia, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Fragile X, Inborn Errors of Metabolism, and Lysosomal Storage Disorders are just some frequently encountered genetic disorders, informed Dr. Ratna Dua Puri, Senior Consultant, Institute of Genetics and Genomics, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi.

Approximately 7,000 rare diseases have been identified so far, with about 80 percent of these are genetic in origin and predominantly affect children. Even though these diseases are rare, collectively they contribute to a significant burden and affect 06-08 percent of the population. Rare diseases impose a significant societal, medical and economic burden on patients, communities and healthcare systems.

Commenting on World Rare Disease Day, Dr. Puri said, “The exact burden of rare disorders in India is not known due to the lack of epidemiological data. Currently, we do not have a standard definition for rare disorders but can extrapolate one from the current existing definitions to estimate that disorders that affect less than one in 2500 individuals are rare disorders”.

The symptoms of the rare disease vary based on the disorder. For example, in Thalassemia there is chronic anemia with Hepatosplenomegaly. Rare disorders also affect the central nervous system and some have multi-systemic involvement.

“If we really want to bring change for rare disease patients and make the National Rare Disease Policy effective, the country should explore the possibility of setting up a technical body within the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in order to effectively monitor corpus fund spending at a central and regional level, as well as taking steps to ensure the states are implementing the policy so that patients start benefitting from this great government initiative”, commented Dr. Puri on the policy.

In addition, attention to generating awareness, early diagnosis and prevention are paramount for appropriate management of genetic disorders, she further noted.","NEW DELHI: Rare diseases, which are often referred to as orphan diseases, are estimated to have impacted 72-96 million people in India.

Although it looks as a huge piece, a closer look would reveal intricate designs that have been combined to make the bigger picture. “A popular art form, mandala is not easy to work on. But it can relieve your minds off complex thoughts,” says artist Prasun Balasubramaniam. This Coimbatore-based biotechnologist-cum-artist will soon be in the city to conduct a session on the art form that she says has only done her good.

“This is my first workshop in Chennai, and I am really excited. I have had good response from Bengaluru and Coimbatore, so I am looking forward to sharing my works there. Art has a lot of scope and I wish to spread it across in Chennai as well,” she says.

An art enthusiast since her childhood, it was during her Physics classes in grade 11 that Prasun started doodling on her books, without knowing the art form. “I read an article two years back about zentangle and mandala art and that is when I understood more about it and started following works of artists on social media to get inspiration,” she says. But she realised that she should dwell into her own thoughts and draw on paper, and started posting her works on Instagram. Today she has more than 7,000 followers.

The intricacies in the designs make Prasun feel at peace. She is also keenly promoting the art to create more awareness on mental health as well. “When I started doodling, I was suffering from depression. But once I began to draw regularly, I was able to overcome all the mental health issues completely,” she shares adding that though many suffer from depression, anxiety and other issues, they are still not comfortable to open up about it. She aims to reach out to them through these workshops.

Her challenges? “It is time consuming. Even the smallest designs take up to nine hours to complete, as it requires to be neat and perfect,” she says. Prasun uses only pens to draw and promotes the same in her workshops too. “Even if people make errors, I teach them how to cover it, using the colours and pens.”

Though she uses colours, Prasun prefers black and white because colours can be confusing. “Colours are important, but when you are drawing a professional piece of art, black and white is intense and conveys a lot more,” she explains.

Axle Wood reduces toxic effects of chemotherapy,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/06/axle-wood-reduces-toxic-effects-of-chemotherapy-1783054.html,"Thursday, March 8, 2018 09:44 AM +0530","CHENNAI:Milk fever or Postparturient Hypocalcemia, commonly known by its misnomer ‘fever’, is a very fatal disease in cows. Three stages of milk fever have been reported. The symptoms include hypersensitivity, ear twitching, head-hobbing, periphereal pulses and few more. Continued milk fever may lead to coma. Injecting intravenous calcium is prescribed in the modern system of medicine, but it is said to be lethal as it can cause heart blockade.

Our traditional medical systems not only care for humans, but also cattle and plants. Even for milk fever, our traditional systems of medicine have incredibly simple cures. Decoction of the bark of a tree is orally administered thrice a day for three days to alleviate this fever. This wonder tree is known as Dhava in Ayurveda, in Tamil it is called Vai Maram or Vetkaali; in Kannada it is known as Dindiga.

Botanically, this tree is known as Anogeissus latifolia. Popularly known as Axle Wood, it is a medium-sized, deciduous tree that grows up to 12 mtall. It has a straight trunk with drooping branches and grey-pubescent branchlets. The bark is pale yellow or pinkish brown, usually peeling off in thin papery flakes. The leaves are 5-10 x 4-8 cm long, oblong or obovate-suborbicular with stalks of 2cm length. The inflorescences are axillary heads, 1.5 cm across. Flowers are greenish-yellow, and about 5mm across. Fruits are drupes and in clusters.

It commonly grows in dry and moist deciduous forests, and is one of the most dominant tree species of dry deciduous forests in southern India. April to September is the flowering period, but fruits are persistent throughout the year.

This tree is good for increasing immunity, is used as an antidote for snake bites. The gum tapped out of the stem is known as gum-ghatti. It is known as Dabaadi Jad among the Lambani tribal community, and the gum is sold in and around Chitradurga district of Karnataka as an aphrodisiac, and is also said to be fight against early signs of aging. It is used as a substitute for Guggulu, as it decreases cholestrol levels in the blood. It has also wound healing properties. Most importantly, it is used to bring down the toxic effects of chemotherapy among cancer patients.","Three stages of milk fever have been reported.

New links between heart attacks and inflammatory bowel disease,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/07/new-links-between-heart-attacks-and-inflammatory-bowel-disease-1783451.html,"Wednesday, March 7, 2018 01:28 PM +0530","WASHINGTON: Strong connections have been found between heart attacks and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a new study has revealed.

As per the study conducted by University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, more than 22 million patients that suggests a strong connection between Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and the development of heart disease and heart attacks.

The research was conducted by Muhammad Panhwar and Mahazarin Ginwalla, researchers from the University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute.

Inflammation has long been recognised as playing a key role in the development of heart disease. IBD is an umbrella term for two chronic inflammatory conditions that affect the gastrointestinal tract - Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease.

While studies have shown a clear increased risk of heart disease in other chronic inflammatory conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, this link is unclear in patients with IBD.

Researchers used myocardial infarction (heart attack) as an indicator for heart disease for their research.

They used IBM's Explorys, which is a large database that aggregates electronic medical records from 26 healthcare systems nationwide.

The three-year study concluded that in the more than 22 million patients who were assessed, heart attacks were almost twice as common in patients with IBD (5.9 percent in patients with IBD compared to 3.5 percent in patients without IBD).

They also found that traditional risk factors for heart disease such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking were also more prevalent in patients with IBD.

After adjusting for age, race, sex, and traditional heart-disease risk factors, Dr. Panhwar and his colleagues found that the patients with IBD had about 23 percent higher odds of having a heart attack.

Researchers also observed that the highest risk was in younger patients (less than 40 years of age), while IBD is commonly diagnosed between the ages of 15-30. Earlier age at diagnosis and female gender is associated with increased levels of inflammation and more aggressive and disabling disease.

""The disproportionately increased levels of inflammation in younger patients who may not otherwise have the traditional heart disease risk factors may explain the increased risk seen in these patients,"" said Dr. Panhwar.

""Given that over 3 million people (~1.2 percent of the population) in the United States suffer from IBD, a large number of them may have heart disease that has gone under the radar. Our hope is that our study encourages more clinicians to screen these patients more aggressively for heart disease”, he continued.

""Our study adds considerably to a growing set of literature highlighting the chronic inflammation in IBD as having a role in the development of cardiovascular disease,"" said Dr. Ginwalla. ""Clinicians who care for patients with traditional cardiovascular risk factors who also have IBD should recognize IBD as a cardiovascular risk factor as well and treat it appropriately.""

The findings from the study were presented at this year’s year's American College of Cardiology meeting in Orlando, Florida, USA.","WASHINGTON: Strong connections have been found between heart attacks and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a new study has revealed.

The Oregon Health & Science University-study is orchestrated by five of the nation's leading hearing experts and focuses on hearing loss caused by drugs and solvents - how it occurs, how to treat it, and how to prevent it.

""We're trying to elevate ways for the human population to avoid losing this important sensation for experiencing and communicating with the world around us,"" said co-author Peter Steyger.

""Ototoxicity is a threat to hearing at any age and hearing loss remains a significant side effect of chemotherapy. This review highlights how far we've come in understanding that threat and provides us with a road-map for developing more effective ways to recognize and address the problem,"" added co-author Jian Zuo.

In people, hearing cells don't regenerate, so the loss is irreversible. That's why it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that affect hearing and how to prevent loss of hearing, Steyger said.

The introductory editorial, ""Moving toward a future free of ototoxicity,"" highlighted the latest scientific research exploring how certain pharmaceuticals damage the inner ear while others can protect it.

It also highlighted the need for better monitoring and detection of hearing loss over time, especially among patients being treated with antibiotics.

""Many people don't admit they're losing their hearing until it's really bad,"" Steyger said.

Steyger, who lost hearing as a child after being treated with antibiotics for meningitis when 14 months old, noted that hearing loss affects a surprisingly large proportion of the population - rising from an estimated 1 in 500 newborns to as many as half of all people age 75 or older.

Leprosy germ turning drug resistant in India: WHO study,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/06/leprosy-germ-turning-drug-resistant-in-india-who-study-1782967.html,"Tuesday, March 6, 2018 07:02 PM +0530","New Delhi: A World Health Organisation survey of drug-resistant leprosy has detected 8 percent of samples tested in India resistant to rifampicin, a drug used to treat the infection leading to concerns that the country could fail to its target of completely eradicating the disease by 2020.

The global survey was carried out on new and relapsed cases reported between 2008-15 and shows highest number of samples, apart from Brazil, were resistant to the drug used in the first line of treatment under the national leprosy eradication programme.

“Within the limited surveillance coverage, we highlight the potential risk of resistance to effective multi drug therapy, especially in the highest burden countries Brazil and India, where the rate of resistance is becoming noteworthy while acknowledging the limitation that in those two countries a high number of samples were tested,” the survey noted.

Leprosy, a bacterial infection, is known to silently advance in the human host with early symptoms showing numb skin patches and shiny skin that progress into nodules on the entire body.

Though since 2005, the disease is no longer a public health concern in India, the country still has highest number of leprosy patients in the world and also every year the highest--about 60 per cent of the total cases--number of new patients are detected in India.

Many experts, have reiterated their concerns that Rifampicin may not be a good option as a drug in preventing proliferation of leprosy following the WHO study.

“Some scientists at the National Institute of Immunology too had claimed to have developed a vaccine against Mycobacterium indicus pranii, which is also being used for leprosy. This medicine too doesn't seem to be working the way it was projected. Hence, there is need to relook at the national leprosy control programme,"" said an expert at the Indian Council of Medical Research.

Helmet reduces risk of spine injury during accidents,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/06/helmet-reduces-risk-of-spine-injury-during-accidents-1782876.html,"Tuesday, March 6, 2018 02:59 PM +0530","WASHINGTON: Turns out, helmet use is associated with reduced risk of cervical spine injury during motorcycle crashes.

According to a study conducted at the University of Wisconsin, during an accident, helmet use lowers the likelihood of cervical spine injury (CSI), particularly fractures of the cervical vertebrae, despite the claims that helmets do not protect the cervical spine during a motorcycle crash and may even increase the risk of injury.

According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates, wearing helmets saved the lives of 1859 motorcycle riders in 2016; an additional 802 lives could have been saved if every motorcyclist had worn them.

Wearing a helmet decreases the incidence and severity of traumatic brain injury during crashes. What then are the objections to universal laws requiring motorcycle helmet use?

Major reasons cited for not requiring helmets while riding a motorcycle include freedom of choice, avoiding any limitation on vision, and a perceived increased risk of receiving a cervical spine injury (CSI).

This last reason is based on the belief that the added weight of a helmet might increase torque on the cervical spine.

The risk to the cervical spine is addressed in this study. Over the years there have been a variety of studies on helmet use and CSI in motorcycle crashes, with a couple of reports indicating an increased risk of CSI among helmeted riders and most studies finding no protective effect or harmful biomechanical risk to the cervical spine.

Co-author Paul S. Page and colleagues hypothesised that helmet use is not associated with an increased risk of CSI during a motorcycle crash and instead may provide some protection to the wearer.

The researchers reviewed the charts of 1061 patients who had been injured in motorcycle crashes and treated at a single Level 1 trauma center in Wisconsin between January 1, 2010, and January 1, 2015.

Of those patients, 323 (30.4 percent) were wearing helmets at the time of the crash and 738 (69.6 percent) were not. Notably, Wisconsin law does not require all riders to wear a helmet.

At least one CSI was sustained by 7.4 percent of the riders wearing a helmet and 15.4 percent of those not wearing one; this difference in percentages is statistically significant (p = 0.001). Cervical spine fractures occurred more often in patients who were not wearing helmets (10.8 percent compared to 4.6 percent; p = 0.001), as did ligament injuries (1.9 percent compared with 0.3 percent; p = 0.04); again these differences are statistically significant.

There were no significant differences between groups (helmeted vs. un-helmeted riders) with respect to other types of cervical spine injuries that were sustained: nerve root injury, cervical strain, or cord contusion.

In summary, Page and colleagues showed that helmet use is associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of sustaining a CSI during a motorcycle crash, particularly fractures of the cervical vertebrae.

Although the study population is small, the authors believed the results provide additional evidence in support of wearing helmets to prevent severe injury in motorcycle crashes.

When asked about the findings, Dr. Nathaniel P. Brooks, co-author, stated, ""Our study suggests that wearing a motorcycle helmet is a reasonable way to limit the risk of injury to the cervical spine in a motorcycle crash.""

When asked about the findings, Dr. Nathaniel P. Brooks, co-author, stated, ""Our study suggests that wearing a motorcycle helmet is a reasonable way to limit the risk of injury to the cervical spine in a motorcycle crash.""

The findings from the study are published in the Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine.","WASHIGNTON: Turns out, helmet use is associated with reduced risk of cervical spine injury during motorcycle crashes.
What then are the objections to universal laws requiring motorcycle helmet use?
Major reasons cited for not requiring helmets while riding a motorcycle include freedom of choice, avoiding any limitation on vision, and a perceived increased risk of receiving a cervical spine injury (CSI).
This last reason is based on the belief that the added weight of a helmet might increase torque on the cervical spine.
There were no significant differences between groups (helmeted vs. un-helmeted riders) with respect to other types of cervical spine injuries that were sustained: nerve root injury, cervical strain, or cord contusion.","['wearing', 'motorcycle', 'csi', 'helmets', 'study', 'helmet', 'injury', 'accidents', 'risk', 'spine', 'reduces', 'cervical']",
Scientists decode physical impact of smiles,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/06/scientists-decode-physical-impact-of-smiles-1782791.html,"Tuesday, March 6, 2018 09:04 AM +0530","NEW YORK: Not all smiles express warmth and joy, but they can also be mean. Human bodies tend to react differently depending on the message a smile is meant to send, say US psychologists.

The study showed that smiles meant to convey dominance are associated with a physical reaction ""a spike in stress hormones"" in their targets.

On the other hand, smiles intended as a reward, to reinforce behaviour, appear to physically buffer recipients against stress.

Researchers established three major types of smiles as dominance -- meant to convey status --, affiliation -- which communicates a bond and shows you are not a threat --, and reward -- the sort of beaming, toothy smile you would give someone to let them know they are making you happy.

""Our results show that subtle differences in the way you make facial expressions while someone is talking to you can fundamentally change their experience, their body, and the way they feel like you are evaluating them,"" said the study led by Jared Martin, a psychology graduate student at the University of Wisconsin Madison in the US.

For the study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, the team stressed out male college students by giving them a series of short, impromptu speaking assignments judged over a webcam by a fellow student.

The speakers' heart rates and levels of cortisol -- a hormone associated with stress were measured.

""If they received dominance smiles, which they would interpret as negative and critical, they felt more stress, and their cortisol went up and stayed up longer after their speech,"" said co-author Paula Niedenthal, Professor at the varsity.

""If they received reward smiles, they reacted to that as approval, and it kept them from feeling as much stress and producing as much cortisol,"" Niedenthal added.

Participants with high heart-rate variability have shown stronger physiological reactions to the different smiles, while the variability is not innate and unalterable.

However, certain disorders like obesity, cardiovascular disease, anxiety and depression can drag down the heart-rate variability, which can make it difficult to recognise and react to social signals such as dominance and reward smiles, Martin said.

Listening to music may help you exercise longer,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/06/listening-to-music-may-help-you-exercise-longer-1782790.html,"Tuesday, March 6, 2018 09:02 AM +0530","NEW YORK: Listening to music while exercising can help you work out for a longer time than those who do not have music playing in their ears, a team of researchers, including one of Indian origin, suggested.

Music can have a powerful impact on our mood, signalling the brain to release feel-good and energy-boosting chemicals.

Being inactive or not exercising ranks alongside high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking and obesity as one of the five major risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

""At least on a small scale, this study provides some evidence that music may help serve as an extra tool to help motivate someone to exercise more, which is critical to heart health,"" said lead author Waseem Shami, cardiology fellow at Texas Tech University Health Sciences in the US.

For the study, to be presented at the American College of Cardiology's 67th Annual Scientific Session in Orlando, the team randomly selected 127 heart patients in two groups for a routine electrocardiogram (ECG) treadmill stress test and assigned to either listen to up-tempo music or have no music playing during their stress tests.

The results showed that the exercise time was significantly longer in the music group compared with the control group, 505.8 versus 455.2 seconds, respectively -- an absolute difference of about 50.6 seconds.

Adults need to get at least 30 minutes of moderate (aerobic) activity most days, including taking a brisk walk, swimming, playing tennis, riding a bicycle, dancing, water aerobics, gardening and even busy housework, experts suggested.

""Our findings reinforce the idea that upbeat music has a synergistic effect in terms of making you want to exercise longer and stick with a daily exercise routine,"" Shami said.

City’s young are new kind of neurotic,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/04/citys-young-are-new-kind-of-neurotic-1782021.html,"Monday, March 5, 2018 01:49 PM +0530","BENGALURU: There is a new fear that is gripping young, working professionals in the city. When they experience breathlessness or dizziness, they are heading to cardiologists to check if they are close to having a cardiac arrest.

The good news is that their heart is healthy, the bad news is that their stress-related anxiety is a medical condition called cardiac neurosis/apprehension.

Cardiologists say that they see three to four such youngsters, in the 25 to 40 age group, every day. Their fear comes from their stressful work environment and seeing colleagues being diagnosed with a heart condition.

Besides work-related stress, these professionals are also worried about their lifestyle choices that include heavy smoking and lack of sleep from night shifts.

Cardiologist Dr Pradeep Haranahalli, of Manipal Hospital in Whitefield, with over 12 years’ experience, explains cardiac neurosis: The fear and anxiety that an individual faces over his/her heart which “is generally caused when they see someone who has a heart problem with a similar lifestyle to theirs”. Those suffering from this fear do not necessarily have a heart disorder.

Men are commonly diagnosed with coronary artery disease, making them more vulnerable to this neurosis. The medication prescribed for this condition is similar to what is given for heart attack - for example, Valium, which helps in dealing with anxiety. However, dietary supplements can give relief too. “Vitamin C is the best cure to avoid anxiety neurosis symptom,” says cardiologist Dr Kiran from HSR layout, who has over 25 years of experience.



Fear in Silicon Valley

Cardiac neurosis has been on the rise over the past three years along with the city’s expanding IT sector. The lifestyles of young individuals have been changing during these years with little or no time to focus on one’s health. The cardiologist adds, “There is a need for lifestyle modification, especially in the IT sector.”

Lifestyle in this fast-paced environment can give rise to symptoms that are similar to a heart disorder, such as quick fatigue, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat or dizziness.

Cardiologists say that there is no need to press the panic button, unless a person experiences intense chest pain which is over 20-30 minutes long.

Fear for their heart is causing people to switch professions, despite their specialisations. Anju Dinesh, a former IT employee, is currently working in the human resource department of a renowned company in Whitefield. She says that she made the change after her growing anxiety over her cardiac health.

She explains that corporate work can get hectic and that it is usually the employee’s responsibility to ensure his or her own health. “I could not handle the pressure and was forced to move into another department. Although the pressure is less, working hours are still the same and there is still no time to work on health.”

Cardiologist Dr Kiran says, “it is not just the mental strain but the physical strain that corporate life puts them through.”

Move, eat right

Any aerobic activity is a must to maintain fitness. ”Brisk walking, cycling or swimming can make a huge difference to a person’s health,” says Dr Kiran. Food habits are also a cause for concern, among those dealing with cardiac neurosis, with a majority having no time for home-made food.

Corporates can be made more responsible

It brings the question of what corporate sectors can do to ensure that their employees are fit. “While the US federal statistics show a decline in heart problems due to more access to health facilities, in other countries, such as Japan, firms face penalties if their employees are not weight-checked due to health risks associated with obesity. The ‘Metabo law’, after metabolic syndrome, passed by the government, has seen a reduction in obesity statistics to a single digit.” says Dr. Haranahalli.","BENGALURU: There is a new fear that is gripping young, working professionals in the city.

"Self-defence: Kick, punch, save.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/05/self-defence-kick-punch-save-1782014.html,"Monday, March 5, 2018 01:34 PM +0530","CHENNAI: When Krithika Jeyaram* started working at an IT firm, which entailed late working hours, her anxiety levels had mildly shot up. Particularly on days when she walked back home on a dark deserted road. Her only companion was her father, who would be talking to her on a phone ensuring she is safe. Now she walks on the same deserted road with a lot of caution and confidence. What changed? “I have always been scared of such situations, due to some prior personal experiences. I thought I’ll never be able to get over it.

I attended a self-defense workshop on a whim with no real conviction that things would change,” says Krithika. After the 1.5-hour workshop, she found herself much confident than before. Like Krithika, many women have attended short self-defense workshops organised at their workplaces, or as part of events. But how useful are these short sessions in real-life situations? “The motto is to learn how to distract the attacker and flee, and in worst case scenarios, how to fight,” says Dhanupriya Sureshkumar, a food technologist, who attended a free self-defense workshop, conducted by D4V, five months ago. The two-weekend workshop gave the participants an opportunity to speak about past experiences and learn from those mistakes.

“We learned how to prevent such situations from happening in the first place,” she says. Most self-defense workshops for women focus on two aspects — increasing mental strength and reactive ability, and teaching physical moves to defend oneself. A good balance of both is necessary for easy escape. Conducting self-defense classes for the past eight years, Sreeram S, founder and chief instructor, Krav Maga Tamil Nadu Chapter, states that they have a two-hour comprehensive format that focuses on the preventive aspects and self-defense, taught gradually.

“Women who are not exposed to physical violence will be put off if we immediately start teaching them kicks and punches. So we start with how to be aware and ways to understand the psychology of a predator. We then explain how to use objects around you, and finally physical kicks and punches,” he shares. Kyoshi Bala, a trainer proficient in Tai Chi, Karate, and Taekwondo, says, “In my 20-year experience, I realised that it is important to give mental strength too, which is what I focus on in my workshops. This also helps relieve work-related stress for a better work-life balance.”

Physical self-defense techniques that are taught include a variety of mixed martial art forms, focussing more on the defensive side than attack side. And most workshops also have a pseudo-attacker to practice live. “These live demonstrations are the most interesting part of the workshop because we could practice the key defensive movements that were taught,” says Dhanupriya, saying she still practices these punches during her running fitness routines every morning.

Though many women opt for longer training courses after these short workshops, specialising in one form of martial arts, there are many who don’t have the time and ability to do so. So in that case, will a two-hour workshop be sufficient? “The objective of the workshop is not to make women Bruce Lees in one hour but to make them feel that any untrained person can, at the least, escape from a situation. Like how first aid works — you need not become a doctor, but you can manage to take care of yourself till help arrives,” he shares.

Here is how you can take care of your skin with approach of summer,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/04/here-is-how-you-can-take-care-of-your-skin-with-approach-of-summer-1781874.html,"Sunday, March 4, 2018 11:23 AM +0530","NEW DELHI: Sleep is important for your beauty, but so is a proper skincare regime. Use a highly restorative night cream, which will help moisturise and protect your skin while you take rest, say experts.

Swati Kapoor, Co-Founder of SoulTree, Blossom Kochhar, Chairperson, Blossom Kochhar Group of Companies, and Pallavi Mehra, Marketing Manager at VanityCask, have shared tips:

* Face cleansers: Regular skin cleansing at night is critical to maintaining a healthy skin. A clean and dirt-free face helps keep pores open and aids the skin to breathe better. Restore the skin's natural balance by using cleansers made with Ayurvedic ingredients such as aloe vera, turmeric, honey that leave the skin clean, hydrated and nourished.

* Moisturise: Moisturising should be an essential step in your night skincare regime. It helps in repairing your skin, keeping it soft and prevents it from sagging. Apply a cream that has natural and nourishing ingredients like kokum butter and honey, especially for hands and feet before going to sleep at night.

* Under eye gel: The area under the eyes is the first to show signs of ageing. Apply an under-eye gel every night before going to bed to reduce puffiness, wrinkles and dark circles under the eyes.

* Lip balms: An effective lip balm keeps moisture in and protects lips from dryness and cracking. Pick a lip balm that is made with natural ingredients such as ghee and almond oil, that will help heal, condition and keep your lips soft and supple.

* Dark circles make your skin tone look uneven. Avacado and almonds are not only good for your health but for your eyes too, apply their oils and wake up with puffy-less eyes and reduced dark circle; with regular application, say bye-bye to them.

* Sleep on silk pillow: A silk night suit is an excellent choice but a silk pillowcase will be even better. Silk is easier on your face and your hair, as it reduces split ends and gives you a crease-free face in the morning.

* Let your skin breathe in and breathe out: One mistake most people make is sleeping with their make-up on. Not only is it unhealthy for your skin but there is a big chance that it might lead to breakouts and skin dehydration. It is extremely essential to remove your make-up before sleeping for a rejuvenated skin.

* CTM process: After you are done with cleansing and toning, use a light moisturiser for nourishment, then use nourishing serum and a night cream post that. For night, you need products with more nourishing ingredient and no SPF involved.

* Pamper your hands and feet: Beauty is not only about your face. It is achieved when the entire body feels great. Give your hands and feet the care they deserve by moisturising them before hitting the bed. Nourishment is essential for a happy and healthy body.

Your gut feeling is smarter than you know,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/03/your-gut-feeling-is-smarter-than-you-know-1780748.html,"Saturday, March 3, 2018 07:35 PM +0530","Have you ever wondered about the ‘gut’, which may be more than a collection of cells? It is smarter than you know and plays a significant role in absorbing essential nutrients that provide energy to your body. The microbes in our gut are more than the number of people on this planet. About 70 per cent of the body’s immunity is found there.

Our immune system is central to all aspects of health. When it works well, we fight all infections and when it doesn’t, it ensures that we are at the risk of developing all kinds of diseases. Not only that, the gut is often called the second brain because it is loaded with neurotransmitters. In fact, more serotonin (happy hormone) is produced in the gut than anywhere else in the body. The gut can actually communicate with the brain and therefore gut bacteria are crucial in determining your mood and anxiety.

Nurturing our gut bacteria so that they are more beneficial than harmful is one of the most important choices that we can make for our health. Thus, consuming probiotics or beneficial bacteria that restore better digestive health and help the immune function in a more balanced manner is essential.

There is growing evidence that probiotic bacteria can help reduce our chance of catching certain infections, and also help us recover from them faster. People who consume probiotics are better able to fight off flu, cold and diarrhoeal illness.

Researchers in Washington DC who were studying children found that probiotic consumption resulted in lower rates of gastrointestinal infections and also fewer upper respiratory tract infections. Other trials have found fewer acute respiratory tract infections and less antibiotic consumption among probiotic consumers of all ages.

Dr Mary Ellen Sanders, who serves as the executive director of the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP), agrees that there is a compelling data to support the use of probiotics for a number of conditions like antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, diarrhoeal illness and even common cold.

But not all consumers understand probiotics. Some products labelled probiotic do not contain strains shown to be effective nor deliver adequate levels.

The catch is that all probiotics are not the same and therefore every probiotic should be scientifically validated for its health benefits. So, when you pick your next probiotic, remember that the ‘gut’ is more than just a ‘gut feeling’.

Ayurvedic metallic preparations are not toxic if used accurately,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/03/ayurvedic-metallic-preparations-are-not-toxic-if-used-accurately-1780752.html,"Saturday, March 3, 2018 07:34 PM +0530","Just a week ago, I was thinking about the chemotherapy drugs, a very good friend of mine had been prescribed. He has lung cancer and has been treated with Cisplatin, a widely used chemo-therapeutic agent. This preparation contains platinum.Now, all of you must have heard stories about Siddha and Ayurvedic medicines containing heavy metals and as to how they damage the kidney and liver. As far as I know there has not been a single instance where metallic preparations of reputed Ayurvedic drug manufacturers prescribed by qualified and experienced vaidyars have caused either nephrotoxicity or hepato-toxicity.

In Ayurveda, since digestion is considered a key to good health, things that compromise the functioning of organs involved in the processing of foods or elimination of wastes would never be prescribed. At all times, Ayurvedic management of disease lays emphasis on not compromising the agni or digestive fire. Therefore, medicines that affect the kidney or liver, the agni or digestive fire would not be prescribed. Cisplatin, which contains platinum, is an allopathy doctor’s drug of choice for treating many cancers. But it is nephrotoxic and affects the proper functioning of kidney. It injures the renal epithelial cells and produces inflammation, which affects proper voiding of urine.

Cisplatin has an adverse effect on the renal tubules and the glomerular filtration rate and may even cause permanent kidney damage in some cases. Cisplatin also causes hearing impairment and is oto-toxic. It is also neurotoxic, inducing sensory neuropathy of the upper and lower extremities. Other platinum anti-cancer drugs called Carboplatin and Oxaliplatin have similar side-effects. None of the Ayurvedic and Siddha metallic preparations are toxic when prepared and should be used judiciously by experienced vaidyars. They may be misused by the quacks, but the drugs themselves are not neurotoxic, hepato-toxic or nephrotoxic.

The reasons Ayurvedic metallic preparations are not toxic is because the metals are first subjected to purificatory measures. Vaidyars use natural acidic and alkaline substances to purify the metals and then subject them to varying degrees of heat to convert them into a bhasma or nanoparticles. They look like magic potions. But many Indian transformations are like that; we take urad dal and rice and make delicious dosas. Ayurveda makes use of the poisonous strychnos nux-vomica to make potent medicines for treating nerve disorders. No one has died of strychnine poisoning by consuming the drug, although strychnine by itself is highly toxic. This is because the Ayurvedic vaidyars of yore knew about proper purification techniques.

Now we have Dhootpapeshwar, a 125-year-old company, and Dabur, both manufacturing herbo-mineral and metallic preparations and selling them to thousands of people. If these drugs were so toxic, we should have had thousands of cases of nephrotoxicity and people dying like flies. But that is not happening, nor has anyone scientifically proven that these Ayurvedic preparations are toxic. All that the detractors can say is that so and so medicine contains heavy metals or arsenic. Of course, some of the Ayurvedic preparations contain metals. The point to remember is that these preparations are not toxic if prepared and used in the proper Ayurvedic way.

Fusion from spas in the kitchen,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/03/fusion-from-spas-in-the-kitchen-1780755.html,"Saturday, March 3, 2018 07:32 PM +0530","When you hear the phrase ‘spa cuisine’, you may think of gastronomic luxury in the middle of a massage. Wrong. Spa cuisine has caught on with health-conscious youth in Hyderabad to describe organic, healthy and rejuvenating food. Organic farms, exclusive restaurants and subscription meals have caught on to this wellness conscious market.

What is spa cuisine?

Spa cuisine boasts of a few parameters—natural and seasonal ingredients, uncomplicated cooking processes, and high nutrition. Although many restaurants and web meal delivery services do not label it so, the cuisine is seriously catching on. Abhiram Agarwal, owner of Sante Spa Cuisine restaurant, says, “People associate spas with massages, but it also corresponds with rejuvenation. Spa cuisine is food that detoxifies the body. It is clean, organic, nutritious and healthy.” Home-grown ingredients have become a lucrative business as more and more people realise the ill effects of chemicals in food. Sage Farm Café, which delivers healthy meals cooked with pesticide-free ingredients grown on the farm, has become synonymous with healthy eating. Hyderabadis subscribe to the cafe’s pre-ordered meals, which are, as actress Lakshmi Manchu says, “Yumminess!”

How does spa cuisine benefit you?

Meenakshi Pamnani, a social media influencer and a blogger, cannot stop gushing about the change in her food habits. “A few weeks ago, I realised that I was having a lot of junk food. I looked for a change and got a subscription for Fitmeals, which sends pre-decided organic meals to clients. I feel much more energetic now. I do not like going to the gym, but I love to run. After I began having spa cuisine, my usual four-kilometre run has gone up to seven-kilometres. In fact, when I tried normal meals, I felt sick.”

Is spa cuisine tasty?

Nutritionists have often held that healthy food is not bland. Agarwal says, “I can bet that anyone who tries spa cuisine will love it.” Meenakshi insists that she doesn’t compromise with taste. “For instance, the last meal I had was paneer with brown rice, channa pattice, a bowl of sauteed veggies finished with an oatmeal smoothie,” she says.

The right portions are a part of the experience. Abhiram says, “Our restaurant serves perfect-sized portions of every dish. It’s just the right quantity for you, which will make you feel full but not heavy.”

No, it is not just salads

Since Indian cooking has a lot to do with deep frying with generous amounts of oil and heavy masalas, the presupposition is that healthy food has limited options. But Agarwal says, “We do not compromise on taste and innovation. Which is why we experiment with novel dishes like quinoa upma and quinoa biryani. Spa cuisine also includes desserts—gluten-free baked yogurts, almond muesli ice-cream, coconut oil toffees and so on.”

Nutritionists also approve of spa cuisine. Dr B Janaki, a Hyderabad-based food and nutrition expert, says, “Pesticide-free and preservative-free cooking will keep your system free from extra effort to needed to digest heavy food. It is the reason one feels lighter after eating healthy.” Sante Spa Cuisine has also opened shop in Pune. As health becomes big business, new genres of cooking are expanding lifestyles and contracting waistlines.","When you hear the phrase ‘spa cuisine’, you may think of gastronomic luxury in the middle of a massage.

Hormones do not affect girl's gender identity: Study,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/03/hormones-do-not-affect-girls-gender-identity-study-1781453.html,"Saturday, March 3, 2018 10:58 AM +0530","NEW YORK: Prenatal exposure to male hormones influences which activities girls are interested in, but the effects of those hormones do not extend to gender identity, a new study suggests.

The researchers explored how prenatal exposure to androgens -- hormones that are typically higher in males than in females -- affected whether girls played more often with boys or girls.

They found that androgen exposure was not associated with girls spending more or less time in activities with other girls, but it was associated with an increased interest and more time spent in activities that have traditionally been thought of as masculine.

""People used to think -- and some still do -- that gender development and behaviour is based either on a person's biology or social environment. But I think people now realise that it's both, and the question is how these forces work together,"" said co-author Sheri Berenbaum, Professor at Pennsylvania State University in the US.

The researchers examined the effects of hormones on sex segregation by studying girls with classical and non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).

Girls with classical CAH are exposed to excess levels of androgens prenatally, while girls with non-classical CAH are not.

For the study, published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, researchers recruited a group of girls between the ages of 10 to 13 with classical CAH and non-classical CAH.

They interviewed the girls about their activity interests, gender identity and attitudes about gender roles, among other things.

The researchers found that there was no significant association between androgen exposure and girls' time spent with either boys or girls.

But, they did find that girls with classical CAH -- those with prenatal androgen exposure -- spent more time in male-typical activities and less time in female-typical activities.","NEW YORK: Prenatal exposure to male hormones influences which activities girls are interested in, but the effects of those hormones do not extend to gender identity, a new study suggests.

They interviewed the girls about their activity interests, gender identity and attitudes about gender roles, among other things.
The researchers found that there was no significant association between androgen exposure and girls' time spent with either boys or girls.","['researchers', 'classical', 'activities', 'cah', 'prenatal', 'girls', 'exposure', 'gender', 'study', 'hormones', 'spent', 'affect', 'identity']",
Scientists discover new target to treat depression,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/mar/02/scientists-discover-new-target-to-treat-depression-1781131.html,"Friday, March 2, 2018 06:53 PM +0530","NEW YORK: Researchers at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have discovered a new target for treating major depressive disorder.



The research shows that individuals with high levels of an enigmatic receptor called GPR158 may be more susceptible to depression following chronic stress.



""The next step in this process is to come up with a drug that can target this receptor,"" said senior author of the study Kirill Martemyanov, from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) in the US.



The researchers zeroed in on GPR158 as a player in depression after discovering that the protein is elevated in people with major depressive disorder.



To better understand GPR158's role, the scientists studied male and female mice with and without GPR158 receptors.



Behavioural tests revealed that both male and female mice with elevated GPR158 show signs of depression following chronic stress. On the flip side, suppression of GPR158 protects mice from developing depressive-like behaviours and make them resilient to stress.



For the study, published in the journal eLife, the researchers also examined why GPR158 has these effects on depression.



The team demonstrated that GPR158 affects key signaling pathways involved in mood regulation in the region of the brain called prefrontal cortex, though the researchers emphasised that the exact mechanisms remain to be established.



The researchers explained that GPR158 is a so-called ""orphan receptor"" -- which gets its name because its binding partner/partners are unknown -- with a poorly understood biology and mechanism of action.



GPR158 appears to work downstream from other important brain systems, such as the GABA, a major player in the brain's inhibitory control and adrenergic system involved in stress effects.

The study, presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 70th Annual Meeting in Los Angeles, looked at people with peripheral age-related hearing loss, which is caused by problems in how the inner ear and hearing nerves function and leads to people not being able to hear.

It also looked at central age-related hearing loss, which is caused by problems in the brain's ability to process sound and leads people to say, ""I can hear, but I can't understand.""

The researchers found that people with central hearing loss were twice as likely to have mild cognitive impairment as people who had no hearing loss.

""These preliminary results suggest that central hearing loss may share the same progressive loss of functioning in brain cells that occurs in cognitive decline, rather than the sensory deprivation that happens with peripheral hearing loss,"" said study author Rodolfo Sardone from the University of Bari in Italy.

""It's a problem with perception. Tests of hearing perception should be given to people who are older than 65 and also to people with cognitive impairment,"" Sardone added.

Hearing loss is one of the most common disabilities in elderly people, affecting about one-third of people over age 65.

The study involved 1,604 participants of the Great Age Study, a population-based study conducted in the south of Italy, with an average age of 75, whose hearing and thinking and memory skills were tested.

Of the participants, 26 per cent had peripheral hearing loss and 12 per cent had central hearing loss, 33 per cent were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment.

Of the 192 people with central hearing loss, 144 people, or 75 per cent, had mild cognitive impairment.

In contrast, people with peripheral hearing loss were no more likely to have mild cognitive impairment than people with no hearing problems.

The researchers also found that people who had lower scores on a test that measured how well they understood speech also had lower scores on a test of thinking and memory skills.

The findings showed that those who regularly consumed at least two, one-ounce servings of nuts each week showed a 42 per cent improvement in disease-free survival and a 57 per cent improvement in overall survival.

In patients with stage III colon cancer, recurrence was reduced by nearly half.

""These findings are in keeping with several other observational studies that indicate that a slew of healthy behaviours, including increased physical activity, keeping a healthy weight, and lower intake of sugar and sweetened beverages, improve colon cancer outcomes,"" said lead author Temidayo Fadelu, postdoctoral student at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.

""The results highlight the importance of emphasising dietary and life-style factors in colon cancer survivorship,"" Fadelu added.

The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, followed 826 participants in a clinical trial for a median of 6.5 years after they were treated with surgery and chemotherapy.

Patients may not be eating nuts due to concerns about the high fat content and that increasing nut consumption will lead to obesity, which leads to worse outcomes.

On the contrary, ""our studies, and across the scientific literature in general, have found regular consumers of nuts tend to be leaner"", explained Charles S. Fuchs, Director at Yale Cancer Centre in the US.

Many previous studies have reported that nuts also help to reduce insulin resistance.

NEW YORK: Besides restoring the pre-pregnancy shape of the abdomen, abdominoplasty or ""tummy tuck"" -- a surgical operation involving the removal of excess flesh from the abdomen -- can improve back pain and urinary incontinence after childbearing, a study says.

Many women seek tummy tuck surgery to restore the shape and appearance of the abdomen after childbearing, but the new study, published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, suggests that it also improves two of the most common physical complaints experienced by women after labour and delivery.

""Abdominoplasty has a proven functional benefit as well as a cosmetic benefit,"" said lead author D. Alastair Taylor of The CAPS Clinic in Deakin, Australia.

The study covered 214 women undergoing abdominoplasty with repair of the abdominal muscles at nine Australian plastic surgery centres.

The women's average age was about 42 years, with an average of 2.5 deliveries.

Before and after surgery, the women completed questionnaires rating their disability from back pain and urinary incontinence.

In the preoperative questionnaires, about 51 per cent of women had moderate to severe disability from back pain, while urinary incontinence was a ""significant concern"" for 42.5 per cent.

On follow-up questionnaires at six weeks and six months, scores for both problems showed major improvement, the study said.

At six months, only nine per cent of patients still had moderate disability from back pain. Urinary incontinence remained a significant problem for less than two per cent of women, the findings showed.

Social stigma stops families to procure outside help,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/28/social-stigma-stops-families-to-procure-outside-help-1780206.html,"Wednesday, February 28, 2018 07:11 PM +0530","WASHINGTON: Turns out, social stigma comes in the way of families to ask for outside help for food security – meaning possessing enough money to provide food for the family.

According to a Drexel University- study, screening for food insecurity at the paediatrician's office can be quite effective, but fear of Child Protective Services and a complicated referral process could be barriers to food insecure families getting the help they need.

A two-question food insecurity screening was added to the visits of more than 7,000 families at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) over a two-year period to find out how useful it was.

The evaluation of the effort - run by the Center for Hunger-Free Communities of Drexel University's Dornsife School of Public Health in collaboration with CHOP and Benefits Data Trust - sought to determine what barriers there might be to implementing such screening and how it could be made most successful.

""The screening itself worked very well: Providers could incorporate it into their workflow, and many parents and caregivers responded,"" said Molly Knowles, who served as the lead author of the study.

More than 1,000 families - roughly 15 percent - of the families involved reported food insecurity (meaning that they did not have enough money for consistent access to food). Of that group, more than half were referred to Benefits Data Trust for further services and resources.

But the challenge came after these initial interactions. It was then that connections were dropped.

""Because of patient privacy and confidentiality protections, there were several steps in between being able to identify a food insecure family and connecting them with resources,"" Knowles explained. ""That meant that parents - more than 60 percent - weren't able to connect with the referral agency.""

Red tape wasn't the only major barrier discovered by the study. Parents were also initially reluctant to say that they were struggling to feed their families, for fear that they'd be reported as unfit caregivers.

""Parents know that healthcare providers are mandatory reporters of child abuse and neglect, and although food insecurity is not a form of neglect, many parents described feelings of shame and fear of Child Protective Services involvement,"" Knowles explained.

The study showed that medical professionals were eager to implement the hunger screening and parents reported interest in being asked about food needs: everything just came down to better communication.

With that, any unfounded fears from parents might be alleviated, and other obstacles could be solved by health providers from the outset.

Something that the researchers didn't expect to find was that of those who reported being food insecure and referred for help, 79 percent already participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps).

""Parents recommended connecting families with immediate resources - not only food resources, but other resources that could free up household budgets for food - to supplement any public benefits they may already receive,"" Knowles said.

So that fewer families are lost between their screening and being referred to an assisting agency, Knowles recommended getting families' consent to share contact info right away at the first screening.

Although this study only took place at CHOP in Philadelphia, its results fall in line with others. The interest is certainly there for the screening.

Our busy and mostly sedentary lifestyles attached with a digital-heavy exist have resulted in a large number of young professionals being afflicted with back pain.

Injuries, poor postures, obesity, heavy schoolbags and puberty are some of the reasons for poor spinal health. Therefore, back pain is a matter of concern and should not be neglected.

Apart from diminishing your quality of life, back pain also affects your work and social engagements and in extreme cases, even prevents in accomplishing simple, everyday tasks.

Like all other structures of the body, the disc in the spine ages and degenerates with time and inactivity.

Early treatment can solve the pain and the root cause of the problem within a short span of time providing complete recovery. Early diagnosis and proper treatment is recommended to avoid the risk of surgeries and to live a better life without back pain and spine problems.

Dr. Aashish Chaudhry, Managing Director and Orthopedic Surgeon, Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital, said, ""Continuous cell phone, laptop and desktop use can prove detrimental for your neck and spine health. Perpetual use of these devices influences our stance in unhealthy ways that contribute to neck upper back, and shoulder pain. Bad posture while sitting, standing, walking, or in a static position can lead to stiffness. Bad posture can also affect other parts of the spine, such as the middle and low back. Use any device at the eye level as much as possible. They should also be positioned so the screen is at eye level and you don’t have to look down or bend your head forward. Ensure that your screen is set up so that you have to look forward. Adopting principles of good ergonomics early in life can help you go a long way in preventing neck and back problems.""

Over the years spinal health has emerged as one of the major concerns among millennial. Experts have been witnessing that a large number younger population has been facing spinal problems and initially they neglect their problem. They come for treatment when problems get complicated.

Dr. Puneet Girdhar, Director (Orthopaedics Spine Surgery), BLK Centre for Orthopaedics, Joint Reconstruction and Spine Surgery, said, “Obviously, age-related degeneration cannot be reversed, but few daily exercises can help rejuvenate and enhance disc nourishment.

""Exercise frequently there are few easy and doable exercises that should become a part of your daily routine. Practice yoga like the snake, the downward dog and the child poses to alleviate pain and strengthen your back.”

“If you are a smoker, quit smoking. Smoking speeds up the development of osteoporosis and brittle bones with loss of fluid in the discs and resulting in its degeneration.

""""Hydration enables in maintaining soft tissue elasticity and fluidity in joints. Apply Heat – Warm water baths, using a heated compressor lying briefly under a heat lamp relaxes your back muscles and stimulates blood flow.” Dr. Puneet added

According to experts, dietary habits can also improve your spine health and prevent spine ageing, eat wholesome and better to incorporate these food groups in your daily meal like kale and broccoli, green leafy veggies and cucumber have proven to be excellent vegetable sources of Calcium and Vitamin K.

Eat as much variety of nuts and seeds as possible. Eggs and fatty fish like anchovies and salmon are a great source of Vitamin D. Pay heed to any Warning signs – Although back pain these days are more common than you think but recurrent pains should never be ignored. Left untreated, problems with the spine can worsen and result in a life-long malaise.","NEW DELHI: Over the years spinal health has emerged as one of the major concerns among millennials.

* De-clutter: Yes, it's an overthrown advice but it is de-cluttering that's the core foundation of success at work.



* Having a small green space: Place gardenia at your workstation once a week.



* Positive group support: Positive group support is important to help each other through difficult times. Surrounding your positive people will help you stay positive in a negative situation.



Plenty of people will roam around you, avoid them. Their negative attitude will let you down and be counterproductive to what you are trying to achieve by practising positive thinking.



* Adjust focus in life: You should train your body and mind. This will happen with exercise. Through exercise, we release those natural endorphins in our brain that make us feel better.



Exercise has physical as well as mental and emotional benefits. It will boost your self-esteem for having the discipline to exercise. It is an excellent way to reduce negative thoughts from your mind.



* Focus on solutions and not problems: Where and how you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you zero in on the problems you are facing, you create negative emotions and stress. When you shift your focus towards actions that can improve your circumstances, you will create sense of self-efficacy that yields positive emotions and reduces stress.

The research shows people with longer periods of untreated depression, lasting more than a decade, had significantly more brain inflammation compared to those who had less than 10 years of untreated depression.

""Greater inflammation in the brain is a common response with degenerative brain diseases as they progress, such as with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease,"" said co-author of the study, Jeff Meyer from Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Ontario, Canada.

This study provides the first biological evidence for large brain changes in long-lasting depression, suggesting that it is a different stage of illness that needs different therapeutics, the same perspective taken for early and later stages of Alzheimer's disease, the researcher said.

For the study published in the journal, The Lancet Psychiatry, researchers involved a group of people with more than 10 years of depression, another group with less than 10 years of depression along with a group of people with no depression as a comparison group.

The brain inflammation, in the study, was measured using a type of brain imaging called positron emission tomography (PET).

The brain's immune cells, known as microglia, are involved in the brain's normal inflammatory response to trauma or injury, but too much inflammation is associated with other degenerative illnesses as well as depression.

When microglia are activated, they make more translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of inflammation that can be seen using PET imaging.

The researchers found that TSPO levels were about 30 per cent higher in different brain regions among those with long-lasting untreated depression, compared to those with shorter periods of untreated depression.

The group with long-term depression also had higher TSPO levels than those with no depression.","TORONTO: The brain alters after years of persistent depression, suggesting the need to change how we think about depression as it progresses, a new study has revealed.

Our brain may navigate using just smells,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/27/our-brain-may-navigate-using-just-smells-1779644.html,"Tuesday, February 27, 2018 01:54 PM +0530","WASHINGTON: The mammalian brain can form a map of its surroundings based solely on smells, a study has found.

Researchers at Northwestern University in the US have developed a new ""smell virtual landscape"" that enables the study of how smells engage the brain's navigation system.

The olfactory-based virtual reality system could lead to a fuller understanding of odour-guided navigation and explain why mammals have an aversion to unpleasant odours, an attraction to pheromones and an innate preference to one odour over another, researchers said.

The system could also help tech developers incorporate smell into current virtual reality systems to give users a more multi-sensory experience, they said.

""We have invented what we jokingly call a 'smellovision,'"" said Daniel A Dombeck from Northwestern University.

""It is the world's first method to control odourant concentrations rapidly in space for mammals as they move around,"" said Dombeck, who led the study published in the journal Nature Communications.

Researchers have long known that odours can guide animals' behaviours.

However, studying this phenomenon has been difficult because odours are nearly impossible to control as they naturally travel and diffuse in the air.

By using a virtual reality system made of smells instead of audio and visuals, Dombeck and graduate student Brad Radvansky created a landscape in which smells can be controlled and maintained.

""Imagine a room in which each position is defined by a unique smell profile,"" Radvansky said.

""And imagine that this profile is maintained no matter how much time elapses or how fast you move through the room,"" he said.

That is exactly what Dombeck's team developed, using mice in their study.

Aided by a predictive algorithm that determined precise timing and distributions, the airflow system pumped scents - such as bubblegum, pine and a sour smell - past the mouse's nose to create a virtual room.

Mice first explored the virtual environment through both visual and olfactory cues.

Researchers then shut off the visual virtual reality system, forcing the mice to navigate the room in total darkness based on olfactory cues alone.

The mice did not show a decrease in performance.

Instead, the study indicated that moving through a smell landscape engages the brain's spatial mapping mechanisms.

Not only can the platform help researchers learn more about how the brain processes and uses smells, it could also lay the groundwork for human applications.

""Development of virtual reality technology has mainly focused on vision and sound,"" Dombeck said.

""It is likely that our technology will eventually be incorporated into commercial virtual reality systems to create a more immersive multisensory experience for humans,"" he said.","WASHINGTON: The mammalian brain can form a map of its surroundings based solely on smells, a study has found.

WASHINGTON: There is no evidence to show that hormonal birth control pills can lead to depression in women, say scientists, putting to rest fears that these contraceptives may harm mental health.

Women face several options when it comes to birth control, so potential side effects often factor into their decision.

""Depression is a concern for a lot of women when they're starting hormonal contraception, particularly when they're using specific types that have progesterone,"" said Brett Worly, from The Ohio State University in the US.

""Based on our findings, this side effect shouldn't be a concern for most women, and they should feel comfortable knowing they're making a safe choice,"" said Worly.

Researchers reviewed thousands of studies on the mental health effects of contraceptives.

They included data tied to various contraception methods, including injections, implants and pills.

They also reviewed studies examining the effects of hormonal birth control on postpartum women, adolescents and women with a history of depression.

They concluded that there is insufficient evidence to prove a link between birth control and depression.

""Adolescents and pregnant moms will sometimes have a higher risk of depression, not necessarily because of the medicine they're taking, but because they have that risk to start with,"" said Worly.

Patient concerns are valid, and women should have open and honest discussions with their doctor about which options work for them, he said.

""We live in a media-savvy age where if one or a few people have severe side effects, all of a sudden, that gets amplified to every single person,"" he said.

New target for Parkinson's therapy identified,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/26/new-target-for-parkinsons-therapy-identified-1779266.html,"Monday, February 26, 2018 07:25 PM +0530","TORONTO: Researchers have discovered one of the factors behind nerve cell death in Parkinson's disease, unlocking the potential for new treatment to slow the progression of this fatal neurodegenerative disorder.



The researchers found that cardiolipin -- a molecule inside nerve cells -- helps ensure that a protein called alpha-synuclein folds properly. Misfolding of this protein leads to protein deposits that are the hallmark of Parkinson's disease.



""Identifying the crucial role cardiolipin plays in keeping these proteins functional means cardiolipin may represent a new target for development of therapies against Parkinson's disease,"" said Scott Ryan, Professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.



""Currently there are no treatments that stop nerve cells from dying,"" Ryan added.



These deposits are toxic to nerve cells that control voluntary movement. When too many of these deposits accumulate, nerve cells die, the researchers said.



For the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers used stem cells collected from people with the disease. The team studied how nerve cells try to cope with misfolded alpha-synuclein.



""We thought if we can better understand how cells normally fold alpha-synuclein, we may be able to exploit that process to dissolve these aggregates and slow the spread of the disease,"" Ryan said.



The study revealed that, inside cells, alpha-synuclein binds to mitochondria, where cardiolipin resides. Cells use mitochondria to generate energy and drive metabolism.



Normally, cardiolipin in mitochondria pulls synuclein out of toxic protein deposits and refolds it into a non-toxic shape, the researchers added.



The researchers found that, in people with Parkinson's disease, this process is overwhelmed over time and mitochondria are ultimately destroyed.



""As a result, the cells slowly die. Based on this finding, we now have a better understanding of why nerve cells die in Parkinson's disease and how we might be able to intervene,"" the researchers noted.

A little anxiety may aid your memory,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/26/a-little-anxiety-may-aid-your-memory-1779162.html,"Monday, February 26, 2018 03:01 PM +0530","TORONTO: Do you tend to be worried or anxious over petty issues? Relax, a little anxiety may help you in remembering things, researchers have claimed.



The study, published in the journal Journal Brain Sciences, showed that manageable levels of anxiety actually aided people in being able to recall the details of events.



Conversely, when anxiety levels got too high or descended into fear, it led to the colouring of memories where people begin to associate otherwise neutral elements of an experience to the negative context, the researchers noted.



""People with high anxiety have to be careful,"" said Myra Fernandes, Professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada.



""To some degree, there is an optimal level of anxiety that is going to benefit your memory, but we know from other researches that high levels of anxiety can cause people to reach a tipping point, which impacts their memories and performance,"" Fernandes added.



For the study, the researchers assessed 80 undergraduate students from the University of Waterloo, including 64 females.



Half of the participants were randomly assigned to a deep encoding instruction group while the other half were randomly assigned to a shallow encoding group.



The results showed that individuals with high anxiety levels showed a heightened sensitivity to the influences of emotional context on their memory, with neutral information becoming tainted, or coloured by the emotion with which it was associated during encoding.

'Party drug' ketamine may treat depression symptoms within hours,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/26/party-drug-ketamine-may-treat-depression-symptoms-within-hours-1779148.html,"Monday, February 26, 2018 02:31 PM +0530","WASHINGTON: Ketamine, an anaesthetic agent often misused as a recreational 'party drug', may help treat severe depression by producing a response within hours rather than weeks, scientists say.

Ketamine and related drugs may represent a ""paradigm shift"" in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression - especially in patients who do not respond to other treatments, according to a research review by Carlos A Zarate, and colleagues from the US National Institute of Mental Health.

Current treatments for MDD and bipolar depression have major limitations.

Many patients with severe depressive symptoms don't respond to available antidepressant drugs.

Even for those who do respond, it may take several weeks before symptoms improve.

Ketamine, an anaesthetic, is one of several glutamatergic drugs affecting neurotransmitters in the central nervous system.

Over the past decade, several studies have reported ""rapid, robust, and relatively sustained antidepressant response"" to ketamine, injected intravenously at low, subanaesthetic doses.

Scientists reviewed research on ketamine and other glutamatergic drugs for depression.

Ketamine, by far the best-studied of these medications, is notable for its very rapid antidepressant effects.

In patients with treatment-resistant MDD, ketamine has produced initial reductions in depressive symptoms within two hours, with peak effects at 24 hours.

Ketamine may also rapidly reduce suicidal thoughts.

Combined with other medications, ketamine has also produced rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression.

Prompted by these studies, some doctors are already using ketamine in patients with severe or treatment-resistant depression.

However, since it is approved only as an anaesthetic, use of ketamine in depressive disorders is ""off-label,"" unregulated, and not standardised.

Many questions remain about its short- and long-term side effects and potential for abuse.

""Efforts are underway to bring ketamine to market, standardise its use, and determine its real-world effectiveness,"" said Zarate.

Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital in the US reviewed neuroimaging studies evaluating ketamine's effects in the brain.

The studies show ketamine-induced changes in several brain areas involved in the development of depression.

Ketamine may exert its antidepressant effects by disabling the emotional resources required to perpetuate the symptoms of depression, as well as by increasing emotional blunting and increasing activity in reward processing researchers said.","WASHINGTON: Ketamine, an anaesthetic agent often misused as a recreational 'party drug', may help treat severe depression by producing a response within hours rather than weeks, scientists say.

""Children are not coming into school with the hand strength and dexterity they had 10 years ago,"" said Sally Payne, the head paediatric therapist at the Heart of England Foundation NHS Trust in the UK.

""Children coming into school are being given a pencil but are increasingly not be able to hold it because they do not have the fundamental movement skills,"" said Payne.

""To be able to grip a pencil and move it, you need strong control of the fine muscles in your fingers.

Children need lots of opportunities to develop those skills,"" she said.

""It's easier to give a child an iPad than encouraging them to do muscle-building play such as building blocks, cutting and sticking, or pulling toys and ropes,"" Payne was quoted as saying by the 'Guardian'.

Mellissa Prunty, who runs a research clinic at Brunel University London investigating key skills in childhood, including handwriting, said that increasing numbers of children may be developing handwriting late because of an overuse of technology.

""One problem is that handwriting is very individual in how it develops in each child,"" said Prunty.

""Without research, the risk is that we make too many assumptions about why a child isn't able to write at the expected age and don't intervene when there is a technology-related cause,"" she said.

Although the early years' curriculum has handwriting targets for every year, different primary schools focus on handwriting in different ways - with some using tablets alongside pencils, Prunty said.

New smart lens for diabetics can monitor blood sugar levels,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/26/new-smart-lens-for-diabetics-can-monitor-blood-sugar-levels-1779102.html,"Monday, February 26, 2018 11:35 AM +0530","SEOUL: Scientists have developed a smart contact lens that can monitor blood sugar levels from tears in the eye in patients with diabetes, spelling an end for painful needle pricks.

For diabetics, monitoring and controlling blood sugar levels are extremely important because having high blood glucose levels for extended periods of time can lead to a host of diabetes complications.

An enzyme-based finger-pricking method is the most commonly used technology in diabetic assessment.

However, such approach has been said to reduce compliance among diabetic patients.

The smart lens, developed by researchers from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), has built-in pliable, transparent electronics that can monitor glucose levels from tears in the eye.

Although the device has not yet been tested in humans, researchers expect it will offer diabetics a pain-free way to measure their glucose levels in the blink of an eye.

In the last several decades, many attempts have been made to monitor glucose levels in tears with smart contact lenses, but they are often not used due to poor wearability.

To solve contact lens discomfort issues, the team led by Jang-Ung Park of UNIST have unveiled a new smart contact lens that uses electrodes made up of highly stretchable and transparent materials.

The clear, flexible lens also contains a glucose sensor that sends electrical signals to an LED.

With this sensor, patients can transmit their health information in real-time using the embedded wireless antenna in the lens.

In the study, the research team has successfully tested their prototype lens on a live rabbit via non-invasive in-vivo testing.

The rabbit showed no signs of abnormal behaviour during repeated eye blinks and the LED pixel turned off when tear fluids with glucose concentration were over the threshold.

In addition, during the wireless operations, this smart contact lens could still maintain the eye temperature stably without abrupt heating.

""These smart contact lenses are made of transparent nanomaterials and therefore do not obstruct the wearer's view,"" said Jihun Park, first author of the study published in the journal Science Advances.

""Besides, because the system uses a wireless antenna to read sensor information, no separate power source, like a battery is required for the smart contact lens sensors,"" Park said.

""Our smart contact lens provides a platform for wireless, continuous, and noninvasive monitoring of physiological conditions, as well as the detection of biomarkers associated with ocular and other diseases,"" said Park.

""It also offers the potential for expanded applicability in other areas, such as smart devices for drug delivery and augmented reality,"" he said.","SEOUL: Scientists have developed a smart contact lens that can monitor blood sugar levels from tears in the eye in patients with diabetes, spelling an end for painful needle pricks.

How gut bacteria may increase obesity risk,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/25/how-gut-bacteria-may-increase-obesity-risk-1778741.html,"Sunday, February 25, 2018 03:01 PM +0530","LONDON: The presence of gut flora in the intestines may cause health benefits for some people, whereas it increases the risk of obesity in the others, researchers have claimed.

While sourcing a new link between gut bacteria and obesity, the animal based study found that certain amino acids in our blood can be connected to both obesity and the composition of the gut microbiome.

Obesity-related metabolites were linked to four different intestinal bacteria namely Blautia, Dorea and Ruminococcus in the Lachnospiraceae family, and SHA98, the researchers noted.

The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, mentioned that the gut microbiota affects our metabolism and lead to cardiovascular diseases and Type 2 diabetes.

Previous studies have shown that people with these diseases have varying occurrence of different metabolites, that is small molecules or metabolic residues, in the bloodstream.

The researchers analysed blood plasma and stool samples from 674 participants in the Malmö Offspring Study (MOS).

They found 19 different metabolites that could be linked to the person's body mass index (BMI); glutamate and so-called BCAA (branched-chain and aromatic amino acids) had the strongest connection to obesity.

""The differences in BMI were largely explained by the differences in the levels of glutamate and BCAA. This indicates that the metabolites and gut bacteria interact, rather than being independent of each other,"" said Marju Orho-Melander, Professor at Lund University in Sweden.

With Holi less than a week away know the dangerous side effects of colours- The New Indian Express,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/25/with-holi-less-than-a-week-away-know-the-dangerous-side-effects-of-colours-1778746.html,"Sunday, February 25, 2018 02:56 PM +0530","NEW DELHI: The annual holiday festival of colours, Holi, is less than a week away, and as usual, we can expect the traditional promises to be made of renewed friendship, forgiveness for sins committed in the recent past, and a fun-filled day of frolic marked by a splashing of coloured powder, water and balloons, and a chanting ""Holi Hai"".

Traditionally spring flowers, berries, spices and other plants were used for making coloured Gulal and wet colours from flowers like hibiscus etc.

There is no doubt that Holi is one of the popular festivals of India, but there are dangers too associated with the event such as the blatant use of expensive, artificial and bright colours made with the help of chemical solvents and toxic agents like the lead oxide,mercury sulphite and copper sulphate etc.

These can damage eyes, skin and lungs, says beauty expert Shahnaz Husain

But again, all of us love this carnival of colours, and according to Husain, can enjoy the festival with the use of organic and home-made colours.

These are available in markets but cost more.

It is essential to take appropriate safety steps to prevent your skin or hair from getting damaged.

The dry “Gulal” and the wet colours of today are not derived from natural sources. They contain chemicals, shiny particles of mica and even lead, which not only irritate the skin, but collect on the scalp.

Since Holi is played outdoors, exposure to the sun can have a detrimental effect on the skin. Apart from harmful UV radiation, sun-exposure makes the skin dry by causing depletion of moisture and also tans the skin. The skin can become dry and dull after playing Holi.

What, therefore, are the preventives?

Husain advises one and all to apply sunscreen 20 minutes before going out in the sun.



“Use a sunscreen of SPF 20 and above. If your skin is prone to pigmented patches, select a higher SPF. Most sunscreens have built-in moisturizers. If your skin is very dry, first apply the sunscreen, wait for a few minutes and then apply a moisturizer. Apply moisturising lotion or cream on the arms and exposed areas,” she says.

For the hair, apply leave-on conditioner or hair serum.

“This protects the hair from the effects of sun exposure and dryness caused by colours. Hair cream containing sunscreen is also available. Take very little, spread on both palms and massage light into the hair, or smooth palms over the hair. Or, apply pure coconut oil and massage it lightly into the hair. This also provides protection against colours,” Husain said.

Apply transparent nail varnish on the nails. This helps to protect nails from absorbing Holi colours.

When it comes to removal of colours, rinse the face with plenty of plain water and then use a cleansing cream or lotion. Then wipe off with moist cotton wool. Remember to cleanse the area around the eyes too, using a light touch. A cleansing gel helps to dissolve the colours and facilitates their removal.

“To make your own cleanser, take half a cup of cold milk and add one teaspoon of any vegetable oil, like “til,” olive or sunflower oil. Mix well. Dip cotton wool into this mixture and use it to cleanse the skin. Sesame seed (til) oil can be used to remove colours from the body, massaging it on the skin. This not only helps to remove the colours, but gives added protection to the skin. Sesame seed (til) oil actually helps to counteract sun-damage,” the beauty expert said.

While bathing, scrub the body gently with a loofah or wash cloth. Immediately after your bath, apply a moisturizer on the face and body, while the skin is still damp. This helps to seal in moisture.

If there is itching, add two tablespoons vinegar to a mug of water and use it as a last rinse. This helps to reduce itching. However, if the itching continues, and there is rash and redness, there may be an allergic reaction to the colour. Consult a doctor as soon as possible.

While washing the hair, first rinse with plenty of plain water to wash away the dry colours and tiny particles of mica. Then apply a mild herbal shampoo, working it into the hair with the fingers. Massage the scalp gently and rinse thoroughly with water again.

Beer can be used as a last rinse. In fact, it will soften and condition the hair. Add the juice of a lemon to the beer. Pour over the hair after shampoo. Leave on for a few minutes and rinse off with plain water.

The day after Holi, mix two tablespoons of honey with half-a-cup of curd. Add a pinch of turmeric. Apply this on the face, neck and arms. Leave it on for 20 minutes and wash off with water. This helps to remove the tan and soften the skin.

Over the next few days, give your hair nourishment by mixing one tablespoon of pure coconut oil with one teaspoon of castor oil.

“Heat and apply on the hair. Then dip a towel in hot water, squeeze out the water and wrap the hot towel around the head, like a turban. Keep it on for five minutes. Repeat the hot towel wrap three to four times. This helps the hair and scalp absorb the oil better. Wash your hair after an hour,” Husain concludes.

""As early as the mid-30s, women start to experience declines in fertility, increased rates of miscarriage and maternal age-related birth defects,"" said Coleen Murphy from the Princeton University in the US.

""All of these problems are thought to be caused by declining egg quality, rather than a lack of eggs,"" said Murphy.

The researchers used a microscopic worm, Caenorhabditis elegans (C elegans), to study longevity.

For the study, published in the journal Current Biology, they investigated downregulated group of proteins, cathepsin B proteases, that are rare in high-quality eggs and more common in eggs that have begun degrading with age.

The existence of drugs that block these exact proteins provided an opportunity to test their effects.

Another experiment that knocked out the cathepsin B genes entirely succeeded in extending worms fertility by about 10 percent.

""If applied to humans, it could be a three- to six-year extension of your reproductive period,"" said Nicole Templeman from Princeton University.

One of them manned by 19-year-old Swadha Dwivedi was selling reusable sanitary pads. Soon, a middle-aged man came up and said, “How did you come up with this idea?”

Swadha felt embarrassed and said, “This stall is only for women.”

The man said, “You are being discriminatory. You can tell men, too.” Later, when Swadha told Mata Amritanandamayi about this, the latter said, “There is no problem in talking about pads with a man. You shouldn’t feel shy. You must help end the stigma around menstruation.”



The reusable pads are available in select stores in South India and online at www.saukhyampads.org and www.amritastore.com

The pad in question is called Saukhyam—a Sanskrit word that means happiness and well-being. Keeping the factors like cost and environment in mind, Amrita Self-Reliant Village (SeRVe) came up with pads made of banana fibre. “It is a naturally occurring absorbent with medicinal properties. Nobody has used banana fibres to make reusable pads. Amma wanted us to do this,” says Anju Bist, co-director, Amrita SeRVe.

Apart from providing a means of personal hygiene to women, these pads have become a source of income for rural women, who manufacture them under the guidance of Mata Amritanandmayi.

First, the stalk is cut. Then it is put into an extractor machine, where it is converted into thin strips. “These have to be washed in baking soda to make them softer. Then, they are dried in the sun for five days before being given to the village women who convert them into pads,” says Anju.

The advantage of these pads is that they can be washed and reused. “Also, since they are highly absorbent, a working woman does not have to change a pad for at least eight hours. Moreover, there is an urgent need for such pads because disposable sanitary ones have been causing damage to the environment,” says Anju.

Here are the statistics: During her menstrual cycle over a lifetime, a woman will discard anywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 pads. “There are 360 million women, who are of menstruating age, in India,” says Swadha. “If, on an average, they use 12 to15 pads per menstrual cycle it will add up to 432 million soiled pads that weigh 900 tonne and are enough to fill 320 football fields.”

Another attractive quality of Saukhyam is that it is available in different colours. “We want people to buy their pads as if they are buying clothes,” says Deepa H, a staff member of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.

The prices range between Rs 200 and Rs 2000 depending on whether you are buying individual day/night pads or in packs. Usually, a woman ends up spending Rs 60,000 for pads during her lifetime, so the reusable pads are still a better option,” says Anju.

The good news is that customers are happy. “I have used these pads for a year now and feel comfortable. There is no usage of synthetic material which is harmful to the environment and our body,” says the Mexico-based Padma Gonzales.","You must help end the stigma around menstruation.”The reusable pads are available in select stores in South India and online at www.saukhyampads.org and www.amritastore.comThe pad in question is called Saukhyam—a Sanskrit word that means happiness and well-being.

Bloodletting puncture for emergency cases,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/24/bloodletting-puncture-for-emergency-cases-1777467.html,"Saturday, February 24, 2018 08:08 PM +0530","Bloodletting puncture is mainly used to shed a few drops of blood from the superficial vessels in a specific area along the channel involved in a disease. The puncture is done with a three-edged needle to promote the blood flow. Medical acupuncturists have employed this method to treat heat stroke, bacterial infection of the lower extremities, angioneurotic headache and amenorrhea.

Heatstroke: A 40-year-old male patient came for treatment in July 2007. He had fainted while working in the field. Diagnosis showed that his breath was weak, and he didn’t respond to the attempts to revive him. His BP was 3/5 Kpa; heart beat was 50 times/minute, and pulse was weak. It was diagnosed as a case of heat stroke. The regimen was to cause resuscitation and replenish the Spleen and Qi. Three-edged needle was used to prick specific points. The patient was soon resuscitated.

Following that, a three-cun-long filiform needle was used on specific points with reinforcing method to replenish the acquired substance. Note: The Du meridian channel originates from Changquan and travels along the spine upward to the top of the head, playing the role of monitoring Yang-Qi of the body.

While puncturing Du meridian point is aimed at yielding strong stimulation, invigorating the transmitting function of the nervous system, the bloodletting puncture at Shixuan is for removing pathogenic heat and causing mental resuscitation.

Bacterial Infection of Lower Extremities: An 18-year-old male patient came for treatment on July 19, 2003, with a complaint that three days back he was bitten by a poisonous insect on his left lower limb. Examination showed that 10 cm below popliteal fossa was a red-swelling mass, which pained sometimes. His tongue was coated with white fur and his pulse was rapid. The diagnosis established it as a case of poisoning. So, one bloodletting puncture was done in the centre of the wound, and four punctures around the wound. The patient felt relieved. This treatment was repeated after 18 hours.

Note: The spread of poison results in damage to muscles, which in turn blocks the flow of blood, causing local swelling. Bloodletting puncture may act to resolve the swelling and edema of the tissue. Angioneurotic Headache: A 27-year-old female patient came for treatment on July 7, 1994. She said she had a severe headache. The symptom was accompanied by insomnia, bitter mouth, and scanty dark urine. It was identified as a case of flaming up of the liver-fire, and a liver-qi.

Let kids have a ball,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/24/let-kids-have-a-ball-1777466.html,"Saturday, February 24, 2018 08:06 PM +0530","Our life begins with senses, so does our knowledge. Though a baby begins to develop senses— sight, smell, sound, taste and touch—in the womb itself, the coordination between the senses is what a child learns to manage during the growing-up years. Two Delhi-based entrepreneurs have set up NCR’s first centre for the multi-sport coaching programme, Enjoy-a-Ball, in Dwarka.

The unique programme introduces children between the ages of three and nine to the wonders of 10 ball sports, thus making them learn balancing, hand-eye coordination, basic ball skills along with important life skills.

Jaspreet Chandhok, an architect by education, who runs one of India’s leading lighting design firms, Ethereal Designs, and an astute IT professional, Harveen, are working relentlessly to bring ‘fun into sports’.

The unique multi-sports coaching programme from the UK was brought to India by Pooja Erande and Neha Garg in 2012 through master franchise route, and since then they have spread it with 25 centres in Mumbai, Chennai, and Pune.

During a class that stretches for an hour and runs once a week, children are engaged in ball games such as hockey, volleyball, tennis, cricket, football, handball, dodgeball, baseball, basketball and rugby in a warm, fun-filled and non-competitive environment.

Sector 18, Dwarka

The idea is to capitalise on the fact that children get into sports to have fun. Calling her programme child-development centric rather than sports, Jaspreet says, “We are always taught to respect our elders. We wish there were equal, if not more emphasis, on ‘respecting children’. In a class of 30 students, only three kids get the podium position in a race. Have you ever thought how remaining 27 little minds feel? Unfortunately, many kids stop playing sport because of a negative experience or a bad start in gaining early fundamental skills. Our objective is to make child’s first experiences with sports a memorable and encouraging experience.”

Creative methods and age-appropriate equipment such as balance beams, walking blocks, and flippers are used to help kids develop movement and sports skills. Harveen says, “Enjoy-a-Ball is a fun-based programme during which children tend to build passion for a particular sport. Apart from physical development, we focus on developing life skills such as positive attitude, self-esteem, concentration, social interaction, sportsmanship values and confidence.”

The programme is divided into three stages—Bee Bops for 3-4-year-olds, Play Ball Level 1 for 4-5 years old and Level 2 for 5-6 years old, and Champs for 7-8 years old kids. “We believe that the capability and potential of a three-year-old is different from that of a four-year-old. That is why we run our classes with kids of same age groups only, and we limit our class sizes to 12. This means more attention to your child,” says Jaspreet.

The award-winning multi-sports programme was developed by physiotherapists, occupational therapists and physical education specialists with the goal of giving children a solid foundation in movement, sports and social skills.

Moderately priced at `1,400 a month and `3,600 a quarter, the programme has attracted a lot of positive attention. Over 90 kids have enrolled for the course, within a week of its launch. “Sports are essential for proper growth and personality development. If physical, mental and emotional skills can be imbibed in fun way, then why not,” says Gaurav Kandpal, an IT professional, who has enrolled his three-year-old daughter Vani in the programme. Classes are being held at Delhi International School Edge, Sector 18, Dwarka, and the couple plans to expand it across NCR with more centres.

Kids living close to green spaces may have beneficial effects on brain development,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/24/kids-living-close-to-green-spaces-may-have-beneficial-effects-on-brain-development-1778331.html,"Saturday, February 24, 2018 03:23 PM +0530","LONDON: Children living in green neighbourhoods may have beneficial effects on brain development, a study has found.

Primary school children who have been raised in homes surrounded by more green space tend to present with larger volumes of white and grey matter in certain areas of the brain, said researchers.

""This is the first study that evaluates the association between long-term exposure to green space and brain structure,"" said Payam Dadvand from Barcelona Institute for Global Health in Spain.

""Our findings suggest that exposure to green space early in life could result in beneficial structural changes in the brain,"" Dadvand said.

For the study, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, the researchers examined 253 schoolchildren.

Lifelong exposure to residential green space was estimated using satellite-based information on the children's addresses from birth up through to the time of the study.

Brain anatomy was studied using high-resolution 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI).

Working memory and inattentiveness were evaluated with computerised tests.

The data analysis showed that long-term exposure to greenness was positively associated with white and grey matter volume in some parts of the brain that partly overlapped with those associated with higher scores on cognitive tests.

Peak volumes of white and grey matter in the regions associated with green space exposure predicted better working memory and reduced inattentiveness.

Furthermore, greener areas often have lower levels of air pollution and noise and may enrich microbial inputs from the environment, all of which could translate into indirect benefits for brain development.","LONDON: Children living in green neighbourhoods may have beneficial effects on brain development, a study has found.

NEW DELHI: We all know that exercise plays an important role in our general health.

If you're someone who enjoys training at home, full body workouts make for a good option.

Here are some full body exercises as suggested by Puneet Rehani, Physiotherapist at AktivHealth:

- Brisk Walking: Brisk walking is simple yet powerful. It can help to improve cholesterol levels, strengthen bones, keep blood pressure in check and lift your mood.

- Squatting: Squats are one of the best functional exercises that train primarily the muscles of the thighs, burn fat, prevent injuries, improve sports performance and along with that trigger the release of testosterone and human growth hormone in your body.

The proper way to begin is to keep your back straight, feet spread apart about shoulder length with both arms extended, knees over the ankles and then go downward with your butt just touching the chair; then return to your original standing position.

- Pull-Ups: Pull-ups are an excellent exercise for strengthening your neck, back, shoulders, chest and arms, improving posture and building grip strength. Stand underneath the pull up bar, place your hands on the bar with your palms facing you. Lift yourself upward and hold yourself slightly over the bar. Keep your elbows bend, and your chin over the bar. Slowly come down to the starting position.

- Push-Ups: Push-ups are a compound exercise that involves your arms, shoulders, chest, back, abdominals and even your legs. This exercise can be used for quick high-intensity routine for calorie-burning, if weight loss is your goal.

Lie down on your tummy. Keep your feet together. Your weight should be on your chest. Position hands palms-down on the floor, approximately shoulder width apart. Slowly raise your body, straighten your arms, hold this position for few seconds and slowly come back to original position.

- Planks: The plank is one of the best exercises because it tightens the deepest core muscles which in turn help to improve strength, balance, co-ordination and most importantly back pain.

Place the forearms on the ground with the elbows aligned below the shoulders, and arms parallel to the body at about shoulder-width distance.

“Before starting these exercises, make sure they are performed under professional guidance with targeted number of repetitions and sets as per your fitness goals and health conditions,” Rehani concluded.","Here are some full body exercises as suggested by Puneet Rehani, Physiotherapist at AktivHealth:- Brisk Walking: Brisk walking is simple yet powerful.

The study published in the journal Anaesthesia involved 312 participants who had surgery and 652 participants who had not (with an average age in the 50s).

Surgery between tests was associated with a decline in immediate memory by one point out of a possible maximum test score of 30 points, researchers said.

Memory became abnormal in 77 out of 670 participants with initially normal memory comprising 18 per cent of those who had had surgery compared with 10 per cent of those who had not, they said.

""The cognitive changes we report are highly statistically significant in view of the internal normative standards we employ, and the large sample size of the control, or non-surgery, population,"" said Kirk Hogan from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.

""However, the cognitive changes after surgery are small - most probably asymptomatic and beneath a person's awareness,"" said Hogan.

No differences in other measures of memory and executive function were observed between participants having and not having surgery.

Reduced immediate memory scores at the second visit were significantly associated with the number of operations in the preceding nine years.

Working memory decline was associated with longer cumulative operations, researchers said.

""The results await confirmation both in follow-up investigations in our own population sample after more surgeries in aging participants, and by other investigators with other population samples,"" said Hogan.

Traditionally, some health benefits of polyphenols have been attributed to the fact that these compounds are antioxidants, meaning they likely protect the body from harm caused by free radicals.

However, recent work indicates polyphenols might also promote health by actively interacting with bacteria in the gut.

Plants and fruits produce polyphenols to ward off infection by harmful bacteria and other pathogens.

Researchers including M Victoria Moreno-Arribas from Institute of Food Science Research (CIAL) in Spain wanted to know whether wine and grape polyphenols would also protect teeth and gums, and how this could work on a molecular level.

The study, published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, checked out the effect of two red wine polyphenols, as well as commercially available grape seed and red wine extracts, on bacteria that stick to teeth and gums and cause dental plaque, cavities and periodontal disease.

Working with cells that model gum tissue, they found that the two wine polyphenols in isolation - caffeic and p-coumaric acids - were generally better than the total wine extracts at cutting back on the bacteria's ability to stick to the cells.

When combined with the Streptococcus dentisani, which is believed to be an oral probiotic, the polyphenols were even better at fending off the pathogenic bacteria.

The researchers also showed that metabolites formed when digestion of the polyphenols begins in the mouth might be responsible for some of these effects.","LONDON: Sipping wine may be good for your oral health, say scientists who found that certain compounds in the drink can fend of harmful bacteria in the teeth and gums.

The findings showed that for each 10 years that a person spends being obese, the risk of having high levels of troponin -- a protein linked with heart damage -- increased 1.25 times, even when accounting for heart disease risk due to high blood pressure, diabetes and kidney disease.



Troponin is released when the heart muscle has been damaged. The more damage there is to the heart, the greater will be the amount of troponin in the blood.



Thus, maintaining a healthy weight across the lifespan is important for keeping the heart healthy and minimising damage as people age, the researchers said.



""We're finding that people's weight from age 25 onwards is linked to the risk of more or less heart damage, as measured by levels of the protein troponin, later in life, which underscores the likely importance of long-term weight control for reducing heart disease risk,"" said Chiadi Ndumele, Assistant Professor at the Johns Hopkins University.



""The study suggests that even in the absence of such heart disease risk factors as high blood pressure, diabetes or kidney disease, the number of years spent obese or overweight contributes to the higher likelihood of heart damage,"" Ndumele added.



For the study, appearing in the journal Clinical Chemistry, the team examined 9,062 participants, four times over a period of 10-11 years.



Those who increased their body mass index (BMI) to the overweight and obesity range at the fourth visit were 1.5 times more likely to have increased troponin levels of at least 14 nanograms per litre, indicating heart damage.



On average, each 100 extra BMI-years increased the likelihood, or risk, of increased troponin by 21 per cent, Ndumele said.

The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, involved an analysis of 94 hominin fossils.



It showed that brain size increased gradually and consistently, driven by evolution within populations, introduction of larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-brained ones.



""Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that makes us human. It's related to cultural complexity, language, tool making and all these other things that make us unique,"" said Andrew Du from the University of Chicago and first author of the study.



""The earliest hominins had brain sizes like chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since then. So, it's important to understand how we got here,"" Du added.



The researchers compared published research data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13 different species, beginning with the earliest unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3.2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size began to overlap with that of modern-day humans.



The researchers saw that when the species were counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a common ancestor, the average brain size increased gradually over three million years.



The increase was driven by three different factors, primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within individual species populations, but also by the addition of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-brained ones, the study said.



""The conventional wisdom was that our large brains had evolved because of a series of step-like increases each one making our ancestors smarter.

Excessive alcohol use linked to early dementia risk,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/21/excessive-alcohol-use-linked-to-early-dementia-risk-1776694.html,"Wednesday, February 21, 2018 12:11 PM +0530","WASHINGTON: Heavy drinking can increase your risk of early-onset dementia, according to the largest study of its kind ever conducted.

It looked over one million adults diagnosed with dementia in France.

The research looked specifically at the effect of alcohol use disorders, and included people who had been diagnosed with mental and behavioural disorders or chronic diseases that were attributable to chronic harmful use of alcohol.

Of the 57,000 cases of early-onset dementia (before the age of 65), the majority (57%) were related to chronic heavy drinking.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines chronic heavy drinking as consuming more than 60 grams pure alcohol on average per day for men and 40 grams per day for women.

As a result of the strong association found in this study, the authors suggest that screening, brief interventions for heavy drinking, and treatment for alcohol use disorders should be implemented to reduce the alcohol-attributable burden of dementia.

""The findings indicate that heavy drinking and alcohol use disorders are the most important risk factors for dementia, and especially important for those types of dementia which start before age 65, and which lead to premature deaths,"" says study co-author Dr. Jürgen Rehm.

""Alcohol-induced brain damage and dementia are preventable, and known-effective preventive and policy measures can make a dent into premature dementia deaths.""

Dr. Rehm points out that on average, alcohol use disorders shorten life expectancy by more than 20 years, and dementia is one of the leading causes of death for these people.

For early-onset dementia, there was a significant gender split. While the overall majority of dementia patients were women, almost two-thirds of all early-onset dementia patients (64.9%) were men.

Alcohol use disorders were also associated with all other independent risk factors for dementia onset, such as tobacco smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, lower education, depression, and hearing loss, among modifiable risk factors. It suggests that alcohol use disorders may contribute in many ways to the risk of dementia.

""As a geriatric psychiatrist, I frequently see the effects of alcohol use disorder on dementia, when unfortunately alcohol treatment interventions may be too late to improve cognition,"" says CAMH Vice-President of Research Dr. Bruce Pollock. ""Screening for and reduction of problem drinking, and treatment for alcohol use disorders need to start much earlier in primary care.""

The authors also noted that only the most severe cases of alcohol use disorder - ones involving hospitalization - were included in the study. This could mean that, because of ongoing stigma regarding the reporting of alcohol-use disorders, the association between chronic heavy drinking and dementia may be even stronger.

Stigma can cause depression in Multiple Sclerosis patients,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/21/stigma-can-cause-depression-in-multiple-sclerosis-patients-1776692.html,"Wednesday, February 21, 2018 12:08 PM +0530","WASHINGTON: According to a study, the stigma of Multiple Sclerosis can increase the risk of depression in the patients.

The researchers added that having a support system of friends and family and a sense of autonomy may help reduce the harmful effects of stigma.

As part of an ongoing research project, people living with MS who reported higher levels of stigma also reported more symptoms of depression and were more likely to meet the thresholds for clinical depression.

By using a longitudinal methodology, which gathers data from the same people over time, the researchers conclude that stigma is likely to be a cause of depression.

Researchers have known for some time that people with MS have high rates of depression, but had limited data on why depression rates were so high, said Margaret Cadden, a doctoral student in psychology at Penn State and lead author of the study.

""About 50 percent of people with MS will have depression during their lifetime compared to 17 percent of the general public, but the causes of these high rates of depression in MS are not well understood,"" said Cadden. ""Our study helps identify stigma as an important social contributor.""

Stigma is the experience of being set apart and seen as less than others because of a personal characteristic or group membership, according to the researchers.

""Research suggests that having a chronic illness can make people feel isolated, separated and judged,"" said Cadden. ""People living with MS know that they have a disease that's currently incurable, and that often brings a host of symptoms that may contribute to people becoming stigmatized.""

Symptoms of MS include motor impairment, visual problems, fatigue, pain, speech problems and cognitive difficulties, added Cadden.

Having stronger social bonds can create a psychological buffer that may help alleviate some of stigma's negative effects, said Jonathan Cook, assistant professor of psychology, Penn State, and the study's senior author.

""We found that people with greater psychosocial reserve -- that is, their sense of having a support network and a sense of belonging, and being able to advocate for their needs -- were less affected by stigma,"" said Cook. ""They were less likely to be depressed even if they experienced stigma.""

The researchers suggest that the study on the link between stigma and depression in MS patients may shine a light on the role stigma plays in depression for patients who are suffering from other illnesses and conditions.

Stigma is often connected with conditions where personal responsibility is thought to play a role, for example, HIV and drug abuse. However, the researchers said that the findings suggest that stigma may play a role in causing depression among people who suffer from other conditions that have little involvement with personal responsibility, like MS.

""Personal responsibility is thought to intensify stigma,"" said Cook. ""Research on stigma from chronic illness has often focused on conditions like HIV and lung cancer, where stigma can be based in part on people's sense that the illness might have been prevented. So, there is a perspective where you might wonder how much stigma would be a problem for people living with MS. And the reality we're finding is that it is an issue, and that it worsens depression.""

The researchers used data from 5,369 participants enrolled in the semi-annual survey conducted by the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis -- NARCOMS -- a registry of people living with MS who are surveyed twice per year. NARCOMS is sponsored by the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers.

STEEL (for spliced-transcript endothelial-enriched lncRNA), was one of the genes in a newly described group of genes called long non-coding RNAs, or lncRNAs that was found to sense inadequate blood flow in microscopic blood vessels.



The findings could help scientists better understand cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and strokes, which result from inadequate blood flow.

Can exposure to certain viruses lead to diabetes?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/20/can-exposure-to-certain-viruses-lead-to-diabetes-1776266.html,"Tuesday, February 20, 2018 07:23 PM +0530","NEW YORK: Scientists have identified four viruses that can produce insulin-like hormones that are active on human cells, thereby opening up possibilities of revealing biological mechanisms that may cause diabetes or cancer.



Every cell in the body responds to the hormone insulin, and if that process starts to fail, you get diabetes.



By analysing large public research databases that hold viral genomic sequences, the researchers found that various viruses can produce peptides that are similar in whole or in part to 16 human hormones and regulatory proteins.



""We show that these viral insulin-like peptides can act on human and rodent cells,"" said the study's lead author Emrah Altindis of the Joslin Diabetes Centre, a non-profit institution affiliated with Harvard Medical School.



""We hope that studying these processes will help us to better understand the role of microbes in human disease,"" Altindis said.



The viruses, detailed in the study published in the journal PNAS, were from a family of viruses known to infect fish.



To find out if they could be active in mammals, the researchers chemically synthesised these viral insulin-like peptides (VILPs).



Experimenting in mouse and human cells, the scientists studied whether the VILPs could act like hormones.



Their experiments proved that the VILPs could indeed bind to human insulin receptors and receptors for a closely-related hormone called IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1).



These are the critical proteins on the cells that tell them to take up glucose and to grow.



Additionally, the peptides could stimulate all of the signalling pathways inside the cells that were stimulated by human insulin and IGF-1.



And mice injected with the viral peptides exhibited lower levels of blood glucose, another sign of insulin action.



Moreover, analysis of databases of viruses found in the human intestine showed evidence that humans are exposed to these viruses, the study said.



""Indeed, the discovery of the viral insulin-like hormones raises the question of what their role might be in diabetes, as well as autoimmune disease, cancer and other metabolic conditions,"" said study senior author C. Ronald Kahn, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.



""What really caught our attention were four viruses that had insulin-like sequences,"" Kahn said.



The scientists now will broaden their search for other viruses that produce human-like hormones.



""We certainly expect to find many more viral hormones, including more viral insulins, in the future,"" Kahn said.","NEW YORK: Scientists have identified four viruses that can produce insulin-like hormones that are active on human cells, thereby opening up possibilities of revealing biological mechanisms that may cause diabetes or cancer.

The findings of the study suggest that youths with psychiatric disorders, currently receiving inpatient services, reported lower self-concept, particularly global self-worth, compared to those receiving outpatient services.



""This was the first study that examined youth with psychiatric disorder by comparing what type of service they were receiving and whether that was associated with self-concept,"" said Mark Ferro, Assistant Professor at the University of Waterloo.



""We know that global self-worth is lower in the inpatient group and we know from other research that lower self-concept is a precursor to other more serious mental health problems,"" Ferro said.



For the study, published in the Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, researchers examined a group of youth aged between 8-17 years who were receiving inpatient and outpatient psychiatric services.



The participants' self-concept was measured using the Self-Perception Profile for Children and Adolescents.



According to the researchers, self-concept might be an important aspect to consider when implementing treatment programmes to improve the mental health of youth who are hospitalised.



""Because youths who are in the inpatient service have a lower self-concept, therapies within their overall treatment program aiming to improve self-worth might be worthwhile,"" the researcher noted.

""(The) results suggest that all activities, however modest, are beneficial. The finding that (low intensity physical activity) is associated with lower risk of mortality is especially important among older men, as most of their daily physical activity is of light intensity,"" said the researchers led by Barbara Jefferis of University College London.



Clocking 150 minutes of weekly physical activity of any level, even if accumulated in short bouts, might be critical, suggest the findings published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.



Current exercise guidelines recommend accumulating at least 150 minutes a week of moderate to vigorous physical activity in bouts lasting 10 or more minutes. But such a pattern is not always easy for older adults to achieve, the researchers said.



To find out if other patterns of activity might still contribute to lowering the risk of death, the researchers drew on data from the British Regional Heart Study.



The final analysis of the study was based on more than 1,000 men, whose average age was 78.



They were asked to wear an accelerometer -- a portable gadget that continuously tracks the volume and intensity of physical activity -- during waking hours for seven days.



During the monitoring period, which averaged around five years, 194 of the men died.



The accelerometer findings indicated that total volume of physical activity, from light intensity upwards, was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause.



Each additional 30 minutes a day of light intensity activity was associated with a 17 per cent reduction in the risk of death, the study said.



While the equivalent reduction in the risk of death was around 33 per cent for each additional 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity a day, the benefits of light intensity activity were large enough to mean that this too might prolong life.



And there was no evidence to suggest that clocking up moderate to vigorous activity in bouts of 10 minutes or more was better than accumulating it in shorter bouts, the study said.

One more Christmas,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/feb/19/one-more-christmas-1775326.html,"Tuesday, February 20, 2018 12:11 PM +0530","KOCHI: Christmas is always the perfect time for family reunions. Sara Thomas eagerly awaited the arrival of the families of her doctor son , Jacob from the US and daughter, Meena from the UK. But somehow this year even the bright smiles of grandchildren could not reduce the pain in her joints and the breathlessness which was making it difficult even to walk short distances. For the last few months, her husband, Dr Thomas had consulted various colleagues who were trying their best, subtly putting the blame on her crossing the 70th year milestone also.Sara was somehow not convinced how she could become 15- 20 years weaker in a span of a few months. Jacob who was my classmate, also noticed this and called me on December 24 and we chalked out a plan after Christmas.

When our team first saw Sara after admission on December 26, there was no doubt that she had a serious, possibly life threatening illness. Haemoglobin was just 6 gm % , ESR more than 100 and the Oxygen levels in the blood maintained only with supplemental oxygen. It was a wonder how an experienced and senior doctor like her husband could miss the evolving danger, blaming most of the symptoms on rheumatism and ageing. We see this quite often in cancer cases because mind has the strange capacity to mask reality and rely on false hopes when the danger seems too big! CT scan confirmed that there were several masses in the lung and we immediately performed a biopsy from one. A brave woman, Sara also agreed for a bone marrow biopsy the very next day in view of low counts.

As her condition was deteriorating, we speed tracked the reports within three days. In the multidisciplinary meeting, the radiologist had no doubt about the shadows being of lung cancer.

Pathologist named the same as adenocarcinoma of lung. The surprise came when the haematologist put up the bone marrow slides showing Acute Leukemia. Breaking bad news is a routine for us clinicians in cancer care. We try to focus on the good points even in an incurable cancer. But Sara was a unique one with two serious issues diagnosed together. As I knew the family well, there was an open discussion about the expected outcomes. The main aim we kept was to reduce her symptoms and prolong life span. Usually oncologists avoid answering the How Long? Question. As a friend, I told Jacob “few months”, BUT...As Sara was a retired college professor, she also wanted clarity about the issues. With a smiling face she agreed to go through the treatment, leaving the rest to God. Being deeply religious surely helped her to face the illness with confidence.

Sara’s lung cancer was driven by a genetic mutation in EGFR domain which makes the cells to divide without control, leading to cancer. In such cases,a simple tablet, Geftinib or Afatinib can block this mutation, arresting cancer growth. The leukemia was also amenable to control through a new class of drugs, Azacytidine which again modified the DNA of cancer cells. Both of these could be called as “designer drugs “which are being increasingly used in Oncology.

They target the cancer cells specifically. Collateral damage to normal tissues which causes side effects of chemotherapy are minimal with these drugs. As these can be taken at home, Sara was discharged .Within a few weeks, there was symptomatic relief. It is indeed fulfilling when a patient who was critically ill walks in to OP and talks like any other person. There was some skin rash, joint pains and she still required blood transfusion, but overall tolerance was good. First place she visited was the church and in her words “I had to thank the Lord who gave you the medicines to make me better!”

Jacob and Meena went back and they knew very well that their mother was enjoying a temporary reprieve. Scans done at 3rd month and 6th month showed that lung cancer had dramatically shrunk. Blood counts also recovered and we could stop transfusions. Sara resumed the spoken English classes she was conducting at home. Then suddenly the fever started. The fatigue returned and pains increased. This time the lesions were there in liver and spleen, lungs mostly normal. In a routine case, we would have termed this as cancer progression and advised palliative care. But Sara was a fighter and she asked us a sharp question- Is it cancer or something else? The liver biopsy confirmed tuberculosis which was a relief as there was a treatable disease now. Being immuno compromised due to leukemia, Mrs Sara was prone for developing tuberculosis also. Jacob had come all the way and he jokingly scolded his mother for raising a false alarm! Maybe this positive spirit in the family was the real drug which seemed to work well for Sara. Repeat tests confirmed that TB in addition to lung and blood cancer was under control.

Clinical research has shown that EGFR inhibitors work for an average of 1 -1 ½ years and Azacytidine for close to 1 year. This scientific fact was always nagging me whenever Sara came for review. However there were outliers, living for many years and we always want our patients to be among them reaping the exceptional benefits of modern medicine. We have many such patients who are aware of the inevitable but continue taking treatment with a smiling face. Their families also play an important role in taking them through this phase. A year had passed. Jacob and Meena were planning for an elaborate celebration by inviting their extended family. Being a different person, Sara just asked them the budget for the planned function. The next instruction was very clear- “Give it to the old age home for terminally ill patients”. Sure she came to Oncology OP with a home baked cake and has promised me one for next Christmas also!

However, reports have suggested that even though the account is deleted, the social media giant and apps affiliated with it may still have access to personal data.

Reports recently revealed that Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm with ties to United States President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users.

Following this, there have been reports that an increasing number of users are looking to delete their accounts to safeguard their personal information from being misused. However, media reports have suggested that even if a user deleted his/her Facebook account, the company may still have access to private data.

As per a leading news network, a user who opened an app and selected the option to ""log in with Facebook"" instead of creating a new account may be under a risk of his/her personal data being accessed by the creators of this app.

According to Facebook, any app a user log into will gain access to the user’s gender, networks, username, user ID, full name, profile picture, complete friends list and any other public information on the profile.

However, users who want to know what apps have their data can tap the drop-down menu on the top-right side of Facebook’s desktop or mobile version and select ""Settings."" In the “Apps” option, on the left side of the page on desktop, and on the Settings tab of the mobile app, information is available regarding all the apps that have access to the aforementioned data. Therefore, the user can choose the app he/she wishes to delete by selecting it and tapping the ""X"" button in the right corner.

The report also mentioned that any data previously shared will still be obtained by the app, although no new data can be accessed.

Prior to deleting one’s Facebook account, it is important to download personal information from the platform, as archives contain all of the pertinent information related to a user’s account, including photos, active sessions, chat history, IP addresses, facial recognition data, and advertisement viewed by the user.

A report that appeared on The Verge suggested that individuals choosing to delete their Facebook accounts must also deactivate accounts on Instagram and WhatsApp, as these too are Facebook-owned companies.

Facebook puts into practice what marketing specialists have long summed up in the slogan: ""If you're not paying, you're the product.""

The ""product"", in this case, is all the personal data that users hand over to Facebook every time they react to a post by clicking ""like"", add an emoji, post something themselves, or launch a search on the site.

Data, that treasure trove

This mass of information is invaluable for online advertisers because they can use it to ""target"" people with messages that are more likely to get their attention because many of their tastes are already known.

This is a big selling point for Facebook, which gives advertisers detailed instructions on how to identify and target their preferred group.

""Find people based on traits such as age, gender, relationship status, education, workplace, job titles and more,"" is one approach suggested by the company. ""Find people based on what they're into, such as hobbies, favourite entertainment and more"", is another.

""Two billion people use Facebook every month. With our powerful audience selection tools, you can target the people who are right for your business,"" Facebook says.

It's all legal

Facebook's business model is perfectly legal: The network does not itself market any of the data, but instead sells access to the data to third parties, which often don't read or respect the terms and conditions of use.

This can lead to allegations of data breaches. The Cambridge Analytica firm is accused of misusing data of 50 million Facebook users for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, in violation of Facebook's policies.

Facebook also only uses what users freely divulge about themselves.

""Facebook does not look for anything beyond what you yourself have put on the web, and that's the user's responsibility,"" said Gaspard Koenig, head of GenerationLibre, a French think tank.

""But it's all done in a way that people can't change those terms of use,"" he said.

Facebook does allow users to restrict advertisers' access to their personal data in the Settings page of their account. This will not remove all ads, just the ones specifically targeted at them.","Such bits of information about Facebook users may seem insignificant in isolation but, once harvested on a grand scale, make the internet giant billions.
But if users don't pay, then how does Facebook generate its massive profits, nearly $16 billion last year, up 56 percent from 2016?

It sparked a conversation with a stranger and ultimately led to their marriage, independent.co.uk reported on Monday.

The recipient happened to be Lina Dahlbeck, 37, from Morden in south London, who sent a reply saying, ""Hi! Girls trip? Who's this please? I'm guessing this was intended for another Lina"".

The pair struck up a conversation as they attempted to figure out exactly what had happened.

Despite never meeting, the two chatted for most of the day before arranging to meet for a drink later that night.

""We started chatting back and forth. I think if I wasn't single I wouldn't have continued the chat,"" Dahlbeck was quoted as saying.

The couple married on December 7 and in March, they are jetting off to Dubai where Dahlbeck aims to launch a make-up school.

""Most of our friends thought we were a bit nuts,"" Dahlbeck said, adding that parents of both of them were delighted at the prospect of marriage.

The couple insist that their story is a lesson to others not to give up on love.

Apple grabs two-year lead in 3D sensing race,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/20/apple-grabs-two-year-lead-in-3d-sensing-race-1789829.html,"Tuesday, March 20, 2018 10:59 AM +0530","An iPhone X is seen on a large video screen in the new Apple Visitor Center in Cupertino, California, U.S., November 17, 2017. | Reuters

Most Android phones will have to wait until 2019 to duplicate the 3D sensing feature behind Apple’s Face ID security, three major parts producers have told Reuters, handicapping Samsung and others on a technology that is set to be worth billions in revenue over the next few years.

The development of new features for the estimated 1.5 billion smartphones shipped annually has been at the heart of the battle for global market share over the past decade, with Apple, bolstered by its huge R&D budget, often leading.

When the iPhone 5S launched with a fingerprint-sensing home button in September 2013, for example, it took its biggest rival Samsung until just April of the next year to deliver its own in the Galaxy S5, with others following soon after.

The 3D sensing technology is expected to enhance the next generation of phones, enabling accurate facial recognition as well as secure biometrics for payments, gesture sensing, and immersive shopping and gaming experiences.

Tech research house Gartner predicts that by 2021, 40 percent of smartphones will be equipped with 3D cameras, which can also be used for so-called augmented reality, or AR, in which digital objects cling tightly to images of the real world.

""This kind of functionality is going to be very important for AR,"" said Gartner analyst Jon Erensen. ""I think that is something where you don't want to get left behind.""

According to parts manufacturers Viavi Solutions Inc, Finisar Corp and Ams AG, bottlenecks on key parts will mean mass adoption of 3D sensing will not happen until next year, disappointing earlier expectations.

That means that China's Huawei, Xiaomi and others could be a total of almost two years behind Apple, which launched Face ID with its iPhone X anniversary phone last September.

In particular, Android producers are struggling to source vertical-cavity-surface-emitting lasers, or VCSELs, a core part of Apple's Face ID hardware.

""It is going to take them a lot of time, the Android-based customers, to secure capacity throughout the whole supply chain,"" said Bill Ong, senior director of investor relations from Viavi, seen as the only major supplier of optical filters needed for the 3D sensing modules.

""We may have a potential introduction of a second handset maker into 3D sensing at the end of this calendar year. (But) the volumes would be very low. In 2019 you clearly will see at least two or more Android-based phones,"" he added.

Ong declined to name the company that might launch an Android phone with 3D face recognition this year but said that Viavi was in talks with all the major smartphone makers to supply the filters.

Some Android phones with 3D sensing capabilities have hit the market in small numbers, such as the Asus ZenFone AR released last year, but those models didn’t use the sensors for facial recognition like the iPhone X does.

Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi all declined to comment, as did Samsung, whose current phones use a standard camera for facial recognition.

FIREPOWER

Apple's effort to get ahead with the technology is the latest evidence of an aggressive approach by the Cupertino-based company to making the most of the technological advances its financial firepower can deliver.

The iPhone maker's $390 million deal in December to secure supplies from VCSEL-maker Finisar was one such move. Another is Apple's discussions with major cobalt producers to nail down supplies for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries that power its mobile phones.

""Apple is always very focused on its supply chain,"" says Gartner's Erensen. ""When it comes to new technologies like this and implementing them to new phones, it's one of the ways that Apple can really can be aggressive, differentiate and take advantage of the position they have in the market.""

Several sector analysts say their channel checks show Apple was initially sourcing VCSELs chiefly from California-based Lumentum and that bottlenecks in production there last year also spurred the $390 million deal with Finisar.

Lumentum, which declined to comment, is ramping up additional manufacturing capacity for VCSELs and edge-emitting lasers for the first half of fiscal 2019, according to the company's earnings call.

It will also be helped by the purchase this week of another optical components producer Oclaro Inc. Finisar too expects to expand in 2019.

All of that, however, still leaves the major Android producers searching for their own supplies of VCSELs.

Craig Thompson, vice president of new markets at Finisar, says interest in the technology is universal across the sector.

""Each customer has their own adoption timeline and rollout plan, which we can’t discuss, but we expect the market opportunity for VCSEL technology to increase substantially in 2019,"" he says.

Another producer, Austria-based Ams, also expects to have VCSEL chips widely available next year and says it has won a large deal with one phone maker.

""As part of a combined external and internal VCSEL supply chain where an external volume production supply chain is available to us, we are currently building internal VCSEL production capacity in Singapore,"" Moritz Gmeiner, head of investor relations for AMS, told Reuters.

""I expect this capacity to be available for mass production next year.""","The 3D sensing technology is expected to enhance the next generation of phones, enabling accurate facial recognition as well as secure biometrics for payments, gesture sensing, and immersive shopping and gaming experiences.

NEW YORK: The popular photo and video sharing app, Instagram, is all set to transform how users interact with its 'Stories' feature.

Instagram’s next big 'Stories' feature, their official reshare button, could let users compliment or trash other people’s feed posts, or embed a ""see post"" button to promote their own feed.

""We’re always testing ways to make it easier to share any moment with friends on Instagram,"" TechCrunch quoted an Instagram spokesperson as saying.

Instagram hasn't had an authentic ""regram"" feature with the feed before.

Previously, there have only been slews of unofficial apps

Moreover, users often screenshot feed posts and share them in 'Stories'.

With this new feature, one can pick any public, permanent Instagram post and tap a button to embed it in their Story.

Further, they can tap to change the design to highlight or downplay the post’s author, move and resize it within their Story post, and add commentary or imagery using Instagram’s creative tools.

When people view the story, they can tap on the post embed to bring up a ""see post"" button which opens the original feed post.

Users who don’t want their posts to be ""quote-Storied"" can turn off the option in their settings, and only public posts can be reshared.","NEW YORK: The popular photo and video sharing app, Instagram, is all set to transform how users interact with its 'Stories' feature.

SAN FRANCISCO: Apple users have been complaining about their devices accidentally sending emergency SOS alerts to the police when worn or used in a wrong way, the media reported.

""Using his watch as a sleep tracker, he ended up holding down the crown button to trigger an emergency call to the police, who showed up in his bedroom at 1 a.m.,"" the report added.

The man reportedly said that the police were friendly and helpful and ""accustomed to WatchOS misdials"" like this.

The feature is called ""Emergency SOS"" which was rolled out as part of WatchOS 4 and iOS 11 OS.

It works when a user is in danger or otherwise in need of help.

It is a potentially life-saving feature but of course butt dials are going to be more common than actual emergencies.

Meanwhile, several Apple users have been reporting about similar incidents on Twitter.

A user named Colin Weir tweeted last week: ""Apple Watch really needs a 'I'm changing bands please don't trigger emergency SOS or password wipe' mode.""

And to help us find our significant other, Betterhalf is here to rescue us. It’s an online, match-making portal which has been designed for over 5 million working professionals, who are looking for a partner with the intent of marriage.

Pawan Gupta and Rahul Namdev, business graduates, originally based in Bengaluru, came up with the idea after facing difficulties in finding the right partner. A start-up, Betterhalf will now cater its services to Chennai and other parts of India, too. “Chennai is dear to us. We got our first inspirational couple story from this city. We also have many users from here. It’s a pleasure to organise proposals along the beach side,” says Rahul.

Betterhalf uses machine learning and artificial intelligence for the registered users to find their soulmates through scores based on six personality dimensions — moral values, relationship, emotional, intellectual, social and physical. The user will have to rate themselves on a scale of 1 to 5, on factors like kindness, planner, romantic, dominating, etc. The website then provides you with a percentile score for each dimension and automatically generates the profiles of your significant matches based on their scores. You can then start a private conversation with the person of your choice and proceed further.

Unlike most other traditional matrimonial sites, Betterhalf provides a combination of stress-free experience, targeted subset of matches and a quick turn-around time to find compatible partners. The users also have the provision to give private ratings and feedback in order to filter out creepy users off the platform. “I once encountered a user, who turned out a bit annoying. Thankfully, I had the provision to block him,” says Amrutha Rajan, who has signed up for a three-month subscription.

Have they come across any fraudulent cases? “So far, it has been a good journey. It is mandatory for all our users to have a registered account linked with their proof of identity cards like Aadhaar, passport or PAN card.”

Betterhalf is funded by companies like MIT, HBS, Berkley Alums and TiE Angel Network, and also caters to users abroad. “We have a tendency to provide verified matches with working professionals at top companies like Google, Amazon, Adobe, Accenture etc,”shares Pawan.

The site also conducts various offline events like surprise proposals, singles’ party and various get-togethers for the users. According to the founders, the future of the company lies in it’s mission to build the world’s largest partner prediction engine. They aim to build a database of millions of married couples with their reliable relationship data, which will in turn reduce anxiety in those looking for their significant ‘other’.

‘Initially refused to believe social media could save lives’,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/14/initially-refused-to-believe-social-media-could-save-lives-1786596.html,"Wednesday, March 14, 2018 02:10 PM +0530","BENGALURU: Often, we find ourselves unable to express our feelings clearly, even with those closest to us, making us feel lonely or isolated. But with the growth of social media, many have found solace in strangers across the globe. One such platform that has affected and connected the lives of many is The Artidote. This online community is a space where people can tell stories, empathise, bond and heal through art. Beautiful, moving artwork and captions that capture every sort of emotion - sadness, loneliness, anger, love, lust and more - have helped many feel like they’re not alone.

Creator and curator of this community, Jovanny Varela-Ferreyra, was in Bengaluru recently for the Under 25 Summit as keynote speaker. City Express got in touch with him on how he got started, and about how being an emotionally strong person has helped him deal with the touching stories he hears on a daily basis. Here’s an excerpt of the conversation we had with him:



How did you get started on The Artidote?

In practical terms, The Artidote was launched on Facebook on May 15, 2015. It was an evolutionary step from a pilot project I had been working on for over a year (Berlin Artparasites) that acquired quite the traction on social media. In non-practical terms, The Artidote began when I was a ten-year- old Mexican immigrant now living in the US. I was bullied in school for being different and not knowing the language or the new social structures. Not having the proper tools to communicate my feelings, expressing myself through art became my only means of connecting with others. It was my way to tell stories when I didn’t have a voice. Creating bonds through storytelling, visual and textual, is still one of the foundational pillars of The Artidote.

Why did you decide to move on from Berlin Art Parasites?

After a year of being a community manager for the Berlin-based online magazine, I realised that I had stumbled upon something much bigger than what my job description there entailed. I felt that, in order to make my dreams reach their full potential, I needed to have 100% creative control over the platform and community I had begun to build. The Artidote became a natural evolution into something bigger. It offered me the fertile ground where to expand my creative ideas revolving my passions for storytelling, social media, psychology and philanthropy.

Your tagline is ‘mental health over every damn thing’. To what extent do you think art can help people cope with mental illness?

From personal experience, I can say that practicing any art form is therapeutic in nature. Whether it is painting, writing, dance, playing music - any art practitioner will tell you how good it feels to be in that creative zone. I have the suspicion that it’s because art allows us to open up a space where to feel what we’re feeling, freely. It sounds simple, but having those spaces where to feel openly all your feelings can be very difficult to find. And only when we are allowed to feel what we’re feeling, can any sort of healing begin to happen.

You’ve saved lives through social media. Do you feel a sense of responsibility towards the millions of people connected to you through The Artidote?

Always. At first I refused to believe that social media (and what I did with it) had the power to save lives. But that refusal was mainly due to my fear of the responsibility it brought with it. I’m no longer afraid. I want to lead The Artidote with vulnerable honesty, with the hopes that it inspires as many people as possible along the way. There is an unspoken fact that I had to accept a long time ago, however. And that is the fact that I will not be able to save every single person that comes in contact with The Artidote on any of its channels. It’s an impossibility and responsibility that no person would ever be able to carry. I can only work towards creating a safe, supportive and powerful enough space where to sustain each other and remind ourselves that we are all in this together.

What was your experience like here in Bengaluru at the Under 25 Summit? Did you ever think you’d create something so powerful that has people coming together across continents?

To be honest—and I don’t think I’ve ever put this on the record—yes. Ever since I was a teenager, I dreamt of creating something of impact that had to do with art. I didn’t know what it was back then. But life has a way of making things happen when you align yourself in direction of your dreams.","But with the growth of social media, many have found solace in strangers across the globe.

Google's pie marks 30th Pi Day,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/14/googles-pie-marks-30th-pi-day-1786965.html,"Wednesday, March 14, 2018 11:31 AM +0530","NEW DELHI: Google on Wednesday celebrated the 30th anniversary of the mathematical constant Pi -- a fundamental element of several mathematical fields -- with a doodle of actual pies.



Google asked Cronut inventor Dominique Ansell to create the doodle for Pi Day which was first recognised by physicist Larry Shaw.



The award-winning pastry chef created the doodle using actual caramel apple pies.



The Google letters in the doodle are constructed from pastry, butter, apple and orange peel.



March 14 is celebrated as Pi Day when the date lines up in the numbers of the famous constant. The day looks like 3/14 for those that write dates in the month/day format, like in the US.



Pi (Greek letter ""I"") is the symbol used in mathematics to represent a constant -- the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter -- which is approximately 3.14159.



In geometry, 'Pi' plays an important constant in finding out the area of a circle.



According to piday.org, Pi has been calculated to over one trillion digits beyond its decimal point.



""As an irrational and transcendental number, it will continue infinitely without repetition or pattern. Pi's infinite nature makes it a fun challenge to memorise, and to computationally calculate more and more digits,"" it said.



Mathematician Archimedes used polygons with many sides to approximate circles and determined that Pi was approximately 22/7.



The symbol was first used in 1706 by William Jones.



The use of Pi became popular after it was adopted by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1737.","NEW DELHI: Google on Wednesday celebrated the 30th anniversary of the mathematical constant Pi -- a fundamental element of several mathematical fields -- with a doodle of actual pies.

Parents fear social media more than drugs,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/12/parents-fear-social-media-more-than-drugs-1785855.html,"Monday, March 12, 2018 11:27 AM +0530","WASHINGTON D.C: Turns out, parents fear social media and technology more than drugs, alcohol or smoking.

According to a survey carried out by ReachOut, an internet initiative to help young people with their mental health, Australian parents are more worried about their children using social media and technology than drugs, alcohol or smoking.

The youth mental health support service surveyed parents of 12 to 18-year-olds about their concerns and found that 45 per cent were worried about their children's use of social media.

Ironically, technology came a close second, at 42 percent.

However, the fear from some common malefactors such as drugs, alcohol, or smoking came was reported by only 25 percent parents.

The ABC quoted Jono Nicholas, Chief Executive, Reach Out, as saying that the parents were more worried about the everyday use of social media and technology

""Unlike some of those other products, where I guess from a parent's point of view, you can at least try and keep them away”, explained Nicholas.

The ReachOut had earlier surveyed 890 parents in December 2017.

Nicholas said that the anonymity related to social media is what concerned the parents the most.

""They're really concerned about the nature of bullying that may happen on social media sites and how easy it is given that this is a product that young people are likely to use every day"", Nicholas further noted.

Nicholas continued, ""That the harm and particularly the psychological harm can be really significant”.

The ReachOut is hoping the technology companies to become more responsible when it comes to the young people, said The ABC.

The survey found that the parent’s number one concern was education and study stress among their children.

Commenting on the same, Nicholas said, “What it shows you is that for many families it's the every day, what we would call kitchen-table mental health issues that are causing them the most stress”.

He further pointed out that in recent times, the education system has made certain changes to alleviate the pressure on students but a lot more needs to be done in the matter.","WASHINGTON D.C: Turns out, parents fear social media and technology more than drugs, alcohol or smoking.

The ""TensorFlow"" model decoded massive sets of data from NASA's Kepler Space Telescope to discover two exoplanets last year, including one that has the first known eight-planet system like ours.



One of the two newly-discovered planets is Kepler-90i -- a sizzling hot, rocky planet that orbits its star once every 14.4 days. This marked the discovery of an eighth planet circling Kepler-90, a Sun-like star 2,545 light-years from Earth - making it the first known eight-planet system outside of our own.



""We're excited to release our code for processing the Kepler data, training our neural network model and making predictions about new candidate signals,"" Chris Shallue, Senior Software Engineer, Google Brain Team, said in a blog post.



Google hopes the open-sourced code will prove a useful starting point for developing similar models for other NASA missions, like K2 (Kepler's second mission) and the upcoming ""Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite"" mission.



To search for planets in Kepler data, scientists used automated software to detect signals that might be caused by planets and then manually followed up to decide whether each signal is a planet or a false positive.



""We've only searched 670 stars out of 200,000 observed by Kepler a"" who knows what we might find when we turn our technique to the entire dataset. We hope this release will prove a useful starting point for developing similar models,"" Google said.



Kepler-90i is 30 per cent larger than Earth and has a surface temperature of approximately 800 degree F (426.6 degrees Celsius).



It also orbits its star every 14 days.



The discovery came after Shallue and Andrew Vanderburg at Google AI trained a computer to learn how to identify exoplanets in the light readings recorded by Kepler -- the minuscule change in brightness captured when a planet passed in front of, or transited, a star.



Inspired by the way neurons connect in the human brain, this artificial ""neural network"" sifted through Kepler data and found weak transit signals from a previously-missed eighth planet orbiting Kepler-90, in the constellation Draco.



While machine learning has previously been used in searches of the Kepler database, the new research demonstrated that neural networks are a promising tool in finding some of the weakest signals of distant worlds.

LG has taken the advantage of this.



Before now, users had to invoke an Action by saying ""talk to LG"" before issuing a command but now a user can directly say what he or she wants LG's connected appliance to do making the process much faster and interaction more natural.

SAN FRANCISCO: Microsoft has started selling a customised version of the newly-launched Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ on its store.

The ""Microsoft edition"" smartphones will give users access to a range of Microsoft's apps such as Excel, Skype, Cortana, OneNote, PowerPoint, Word and Microsoft Launcher after setting up the phone.

""The phones look the same as the standard version at first glance and the hardware is exactly the same. The Operating System (OS) will be the same too. It's the apps that are different,"" Digital Trends reported late on Friday.

However, the apps will not come pre-installed.

""A Microsoft customisation is applied to the Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ 'Microsoft Edition' when the devices are unboxed and connected to Wi-Fi,"" a Microsoft representative was quoted as saying by Trusted Reviews.

Prospective buyers can pre-order a unit but delivery will begin on March 16.

Android surpasses iOS in smartphone loyalty,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/10/android-surpasses-ios-in-smartphone-loyalty-1784956.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 11:19 AM +0530","NEW YORK: Imposing a temporary halt on the long-pending Android-iOS battle, a study recently revealed that users of the former have higher loyalty than those of the latter.

According to the report on published Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), Android brand loyalty remained consistently high since early 2016, and are now peaking new highs.

As per the study, Android achieved 91 percent loyalty rate, compared to 86 percent for iOS, as per the percentage of U.S. customers who stayed with their operating system when they upgraded their phone in 2017.

""With only two mobile operating systems at this point, it appears users now pick one, learn it, invest in apps and storage, and stick with it. Now, Apple and Google need to figure out how to sell products and services to these loyal customer bases,"" said a TechCrunch report, quoting Mike Levin, partner and co-founder of CIRP.

From January 2016 through December 2017, Android loyalty ranged from 89 to 91 percent (ending at 91 percent), while iOS loyalty was several percentage points lower, ranging from 85 to 88 percent.

In 2013, iPhone owners were found to be more loyal than Android users. But that shifted the following year, and Android has risen ever since. A prime reason for this shift in loyalty, according to the CIRP, is the extensive user base that Android enjoys. Therefore, the absolute number of users that switch to iOS from Android is as large or larger than the absolute number of users that switch to Android from iOS, the report said.","According to the report on published Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), Android brand loyalty remained consistently high since early 2016, and are now peaking new highs.

Less is more as companies explore shopping by voice,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/10/less-is-more-as-companies-explore-shopping-by-voice-1784924.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 09:27 AM +0530","FILE - In this Sept. 27, 2017, file photo, an Amazon Echo Dot is displayed during a program announcing several new Amazon products by the company in Seattle. | AP

NEW YORK: When the world shifted from personal computers to smartphones, websites had to slim down to work on smaller screens and slower wireless connections. A similar shift to voice-centric services is again forcing businesses to rethink how they present information to consumers — and spurring new efforts to help them do so.

The software company Adobe, for instance, announced on Tuesday a new suite of tools that could help airlines, retailers and other companies create simple voice interfaces for travel and shopping. It's not a simple task, since a voice-based digital assistant can't really list dozens of flight options or hundreds of products.

That means companies have to figure out how to winnow down those choices to the travel options or products people are most likely to want — an inherently fraught undertaking.

The technology is still in its infancy, and Adobe doesn't have any actual corporate partners to showcase yet. But its announcement, made in conjunction with a tech show in Barcelona, Spain, shows that voice assistants are becoming important channels for reaching consumers.

Amazon's voice-shopping feature already boils down shopping requests to one or two options and makes buying easy because it already has payment and shipping information for voice-eligible customers. But smaller businesses don't have the computing resources and expertise to match that, which is where companies like Adobe come in.

Analyst Carolina Milanesi with Creative Strategies says she's not aware of another service trying to help companies improve how they reach their customers through voice.

In practice, making voice capabilities useful means anticipating what customers want. Travel sites, for instance, let people limit a search to, say, nonstop flights, but that's more cumbersome when they're talking to a service. Adobe promises to help narrow those options automatically, so that someone who earns points in United and likes early morning flights might hear only those matches.

Adobe's new voice service will work with all major voice assistants, not just Amazon's. It will limit its analysis to data provided by the particular company people are shopping at, instead of trying to pulling together a more comprehensive personal profile from multiple sources.

That will limit the accuracy of its personalization compared to what Adobe says it could provide. But the company believes consumers aren't going to be comfortable with that broader profiling yet.","The software company Adobe, for instance, announced on Tuesday a new suite of tools that could help airlines, retailers and other companies create simple voice interfaces for travel and shopping.

Fake news travels faster than truth on Twitter,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/10/fake-news-travels-faster-than-truth-on-twitter-1784922.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 09:21 AM +0530","NEW YORK: False news on politics travels farther, faster, deeper and more broadly than the truth on Twitter because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it, finds a study led by three Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) scholars.

Social media has created a boom in the spread of information, although little is known about how it has facilitated the spread of false information.

The researchers also settled on the term ""false news"" as their object of study, as distinct from the now ubiquitous term ""fake news"", which involves multiple broad meanings.

""Twitter became our main source of news,"" said Soroush Vosoughi, a postdoctoral student at the varsity.

But in the aftermath of the tragic events, ""I realised that ... a good chunk of what I was reading on social media was rumours; it was false news"", Vosoughi added.

To understand the mechanism detailed in the journal Science, the team analysed roughly 126,000 stories tweeted by three million people more than 4.5 million times.

Falsehoods were 70 per cent more likely to be retweeted than the truth. It also takes true stories about six times as long to reach 1,500 people as it does for false stories to reach the same number of people.

When it comes to Twitter's ""cascades"", or unbroken retweet chains, falsehoods reach a cascade depth of 10 about 20 times faster than facts.

""We found that falsehood defuses significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth, in all categories of information, and in many cases by an order of magnitude,"" explained Sinan Aral, Professor at the MIT.

""False news is more novel, and people are more likely to share novel information,"" Aral added, explaining why people tend to share more false news.

It is because people can gain attention by being the first to share a previously unknown (but possibly false) information. Thus, ""people who share novel information are seen as being in the know"", Aral said.

Examining this ""novelty hypothesis"", the team found that ""people respond to false news more with surprise and disgust"", whereas true stories produced replies more generally characterised by sadness, anticipation, and trust.

The effects were more pronounced for false political news (45,000 tweets) than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends or financial information.

Moreover, when all of the bots in the dataset was removed, the results suggest that humans have a greater role to play in the dissemination of false news.","NEW YORK: False news on politics travels farther, faster, deeper and more broadly than the truth on Twitter because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it, finds a study led by three Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) scholars.

"Hyderabadi dads, coolest dads",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/09/hyderabadi-dads-coolest-dads-1784650.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 08:59 AM +0530","HYDERABAD: Even as we celebrate women and talk of their multiple roles including that of a mother, we also need to acknowledge how men are adapting to the changing role of the dad. Today’s fathers aren’t just defined as a breadwinner or by their professional credentials, they are now a part of every phase of their kid’s life.

From quitting to smoking/drinking to desiring to stay at home, fathers have come a long way in India. The new term collectively used for this new breed of dad is Penguin Dads, borrowing from the concept from Emperor penguins. To understand the rise of penguin dads, e-commerce firm Flipkart has carried out a pan-India survey asking dads how they have progressed post fatherhood.

An online survey finding by Flipkart in partnership with Markelytics Solutions India Pvt. Ltd shows that Hyderabad dads love spending time with their family. Hyderabad dads also like to engage their kids in common activities like walking and movies.

“Penguin Dads” - The typical Indian family is full of stereotypes. From the time a child wakes up in the morning, the mother is involved in almost all activities such as getting kids ready for school, feeding them, cooking, cleaning, sitting with kids for evening studies, and eventually putting the child to sleep. With India’s economy and people prospering in recent decades, however, the Indian family has reformed in novel ways. Flipkart conducted a survey to study this change in society and discovered the rise of “Penguin Dads” in India.

The “Penguin Dads” - They are the antithesis of the archetypal Indian Dad, challenging and breaking stereotypes about who does what in the family. They represent the progressive change in the fatherhood narrative in India.

What do “Penguin Dads” do?

An increasing number of dads today are engaged in raising their kids, as they are in sharing household chores. They change nappies, braid hair, take kids to school, and put them to bed – many doing it without any help from Moms.

Why “Penguin” Dads?

There aren’t many examples of a more dedicated father on earth than the male penguin. The flightless birds raise their new-borns single-handedly, just as female tigers nurture and protect their cubs. So, if “Tiger Mom” was the face of the Indian family, “Penguin Dad” is its new reality.

Why do “Penguin Dads” do what they do? - Penguin Dads are not super-dads. They’re just the regular Dad taking an active interest in his child’s life, driven by the motivation to be seen as a friend to their child.

His experiences during his stay in an alien city led him to create an app and a business out of it eventually.

“I stay in a paying guesthouse near my college. Once during a spell of bad weather, I came down with a flu. There was no one to take care of me and I was all on my own. Finding a doctor and going to a clinic without anyone’s guidance and help was a real pain. After some struggle I managed to find a doctor and visited him, the next problem was getting medicines,” says Rohit.

He also was not sure what food to avoid and eat during this time. “Even if I knew I did not have the strength to go and get the food or make it,” he adds.After this experience, Rohit tried to find a way to overcome all these problems. “I started searching for an app that might help people tackle these problems but I found no success in that.”

He came up with a plan to make an app to provide all these services. Rohit and his classmates —Ruchitha DJ, Shreyas S and Sreeram D Nair — at the computer science department at the at MVJE College of Engineering have developed a working prototype of the STABL (Step towards Better Life) app. “The app has been developed keeping in mind the numerous people in Bengaluru who come here for work or study and do not know anyone in the city,” says Rohit.

A person can mention the symptoms that he or she is suffering from on the app. A doctor checks these symptoms and prescribes the required medicine. In case of a serious case, the doctor will physically come and check the patient. “For cough, cold and flu there would be no problem in doctors prescribing medicine without a one on one interaction. For serious ailments, a physical check-up is necessary,” says Rohit. The prescription can be sent to the nearest pharmacy and the medicines would be delivered via the app.

While the app is not fully functional yet it will also include an option to hire nurses in case of sickness. “We are still working on the app and will come out with a fully functional version very soon.”Apart from this feature, the app also researches the best food to be consumed to ensure speedy recovery. The recipe for the suggested food will also be displayed. The option to order food is also available.

Guess what! Indians were less interested in knowing what their politicians are doing or what the biggest scams in the country are, no matter how loud TV anchors scream about them.

Names like Rahul Gandhi or Narendra Modi were nowhere in the list of trending search terms, revealing Internet users are not that keen on national politics.

Instead, they were more into entertainment, sports and things that have a direct bearing on their everyday lives, such as GST, CBSE results and so forth. Also, if there is money to make, that’s not such a bad idea -- the popularity of Bitcoins and mutual funds reveal.

Movies and sports are the bestsellers!

Leave demonetisation, GST, and Narendra Modi aside. In 2017, India’s Internet users were more curious about Bollywood and Cricket than anything else.

The year’s most popular search terms had to do with either Hindi cinema or Cricket. In fact, the top 10 list has nothing other than the names of Bollywood flicks and cricket tournaments.

While seven of the top 10 search term were names of Bollywood films, the remaining three had to do with Cricket. Bahubali 2 was the most searched term in India, closely followed by Indian Premier League. The highest grossing Indian movie of all time, Dangal, also made it to the list. If Jagga Jasoos failed in Box office, it did well on Google.

How to?

Modi government’s decision to require citizens to link Aadhaar with PAN seems to gotten many fretful. “How to link Aadhaar with PAN” was the most searched term in India in the “how to” category. “How to” is often used as a measure of what Internet users in a particular country are anxious about or keen on learning.

Interestingly, Bitcoins and cryptocurrency were among the most popular search terms in this category. A large number of users asked Google how to buy Bitcoins in India. A lot of them were also curious to know how to mine cryptocurrencies.

These probably have a lot to do with Bitcoins’ sudden popularity. Cryptocurrency is still vague and a lot of people don't have a clear idea of what they are or how to use them. But the dramatic surge in its price and the attendant buzz have caught the fascination of many who turned to Google for insights.

Funnily enough, the data show that while we like applying colours on each other’s face on Holi, a lot of us sought Google’s help in learning how to remove it. Same goes for taking a screenshot on a smartphone. Other topics like how to file GST returns and how to invest in mutual funds were also among the top 10.

Tell us who won -- not the election, but the game!

Sports news are often tucked away in the last pages of a newspaper. But if there was such prioritisation on Internet, sports should grab the top slot.

When it comes to news, Indians were far more interested in sports than any other category of news. Four of the 10 most popular search terms were related to sports - Indian Premier League, ICC Champions Trophy, Wimbledon and US Open. It is not surprising that GST and CBSE results, two of the things that directly affect people, also found places in the top 10.

Internet loves Sunny Leone

No surprises here! We all guessed it right. Sunny Leone was the most sought-after entertainer among Indian Internet users.

Interestingly, eight of the 10 most popularly searched entertainers were women with comedian Sunil Grover and actor Rana Daggubati being the two men on the list.

However, unlike other celebrities in the list, Internet users' interest in Sunny Leone was far more widespread and not restricted to any particular region.

They are watching us

Going by the Google Trends data, it appears Pakistan’s Internet users search the web with an eye on India -- or Bollywood, to be more specific.

Six of the 10 most popular search items were names of Bollywood movies. India’s Kapil Sharma Show and the Hindu festival of Shivratri were among the most popular news searches in Pakistan.

There are more surprises -- the National Award winning filmmaker Rishi Kapoor's name was a trending search term in Pakistan.

These show the allure and appeal of Indian cinema and entertainment there. Although Pakistan produces dozens of films each year, yet none found a place in the list of most popular search terms, Google’s data reveal.

Into the Breach: A Second chance with the aliens,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/10/into-the-breach-a-second-chance-with-the-aliens-1784633.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 02:49 AM +0530","CHENNAI: Six years ago, a two-person studio called Subset Games released a little game called FTL: Faster than Light. It received many accolades and much acclaim, deservedly so, and proved to be one of my favourite games over the next few years.Now, Subset Games is back with their sophomore effort — Into the Breach.

Into the Breach tasks players with fighting off an alien invasion. Well, technically the game starts after you fail to fight off an alien invasion. However, one pilot uses unreliable technology to transport himself back in time to the beginning of the invasion so that you can try again. The aliens are unrelenting and pose many obstacles and challenges. To meet them, you’re granted command of a squad of mechs with which you face off against them on various grid-based maps.

Combat is turn-based, and is reminiscent of classic strategy games such as X-COM and the like; and, like many of those gems of yesteryear, is also brutally difficult. That’s why, should the aliens prove too strong, you can always choose to abandon the timeline you’re currently playing and open a temporal breach back to the start to try again. It’s a neat system, and does soften the blow of failure that more traditional roguelikes deal in by letting you take one of your experienced pilots back with you. You also get one chance per battle to reset a turn, and it’s a testament to how challenging this game is that — although that sounds incredibly powerful — in practice it’s barely enough to keep your head out of the water.

Every round, the aliens telegraph their intentions — maybe this one’s going to target this building while those two try to pincer your artillery unit and the last one’s webbing your frontline brawler so that it can’t move at all. Oh, and the game also helpfully shows you where new enemies will spawn in next round too — but don’t worry, if you manage to block a spawn point with an enemy, you’ll buy yourself some breathing room. The terrain can be used against the aliens as well.

That’s the beauty of Into the Breach — it gives you so much information and so many tools, and then challenges you to find a way out of the never-ending catastrophe you find yourself in. And that’s why this is such an amazing game — you never feel like you lost because of random chance, or the whims of the RNG gods. No, you know that you had everything you needed at your disposal in order to succeed (or at least survive) and you messed up. That’s all there is to it, soldier — open up another breach and try again.

Cleverer people than I have described Into the Breach as ‘Pacific Rim meets Edge of Tomorrow’ and ‘kaiju chess’, both of which are phenomenal summaries of the game. To which I will only add that Into the Breach is, if anything, more addictive than FTL and is a beautiful many-layered masterpiece that I will likely be coming back to for years.

Gaming trends to watch out for in 2018,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/10/gaming-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2018-1784630.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 02:48 AM +0530","Monetization has been important for Indian game developers because of our low propensity to pay along with friction to pay.

CHENNAI: Everyone has a mobile phone and it is inevitable to not play games in it. The number of smartphones will soon reach 500 million in India this year and the number of people consuming data (3G, 4G and yet-to-be-launched 5G) may reach 350 million.

According to Google KPMG report, an average casual gamer spends 7-10% of his mobile time on games, spending 1/3rd of its entertainment budget. The research adds that they play across genre like sports, arcade, puzzle, action, racing or strategy. Chinese biggies Alibaba, PayTM, Tencent, Youzu, etc are tying up with the game developers.

There was a massive growth of social real money games, like poker and rummy or fantasy games like cricket and kabaddi. It garnered active users in an instant and started becoming some of the top grossing games to invest in advertising. Most of these gamers are men aged above 25 and who spend a lot on these games. Companies like Games 24X7, Dream11, HeadInfoTech, Adda52, Octro Inc, Junglee Games & Moonfrog labs stood out and will continue to grow stronger in 2018. There will also be many fantasy sports games on football, basketball and others. E-sports on online platform is a trend to look forward to as it is now a medal game in Asian games in 2022 and being considered for 2024 Olympics.

In India, games like Subway Surfer, Candy Crush and Temple Run were some of the top played games but Indian games too – Ludo, Snakes & Ladder, Teen Patti and Callbreak have been on the top of the list. Indian IP-related games like Bahubali and Sachin Saga was also top grossing games of the year. This year will see several such games on Indian movies, politics, sports and celebrities.

Monetization has been important for Indian game developers because of our low propensity to pay along with friction to pay. With digitisation, carrier billing and smaller denominations, there were many in-app purchases in 2017. This trend will continue this year. Monetization through ads will also increase as brands realise they can reach an highly engaged audience.

Pokemon Go was the first commercially successful AR (Artificial Reality) game in 2016. Ninatic Labs will now bring out a similar game on Harry Potter in 2018. Apple’s AR kit and Google’s AR Core are compatible with many new phones that will be released this year. VR (Virtual Reality), an immersive, 3D environment is slowly dying, as the equipment involved is costly. While few local developers like EmpowerLabs, PaperBoat apps might create games around AR/VR tech, commercially it might be available only in a game parlour.","Monetization has been important for Indian game developers because of our low propensity to pay along with friction to pay.

Not a ‘Farcry’ from realistic combat,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/10/not-a-farcry-from-realistic-combat-1784628.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 02:46 AM +0530","CHENNAI: No story is sacred within the videogame community anymore. Farcry 5 is releasing on Amazon Prime as a live-action short film, in expectation of the game itself releasing later this month. With Assassins’ Creed Origins finally redeeming the franchise, I’m expecting Ubisoft to meet the standards it has set and blow minds. Based on the trailers and the beta gameplay, here are some reasons why Farcry 5 sounds compelling:

Rad new story: ­We see a fictional county in modern America overrun by a crazy militaristic doomsday cult called Eden’s Gate — with a super-evil antagonist to top the story. The protagonist (appearance customisation is always great) is actually you, and there’s no personal backstory to this person, which makes the actions and interactions with the town’s residents very personal. The main missions in each of the different regions involve rescuing civilians and destroying all cult-activity — all combat heavy adventures.

Open-world and improvements to gameplay: As Ubisoft does, the gameplay is completely non-linear, and we get to travel to any part of the map and unleash the chaos. The storyline allows for us to ignore missions temporarily and get back to it when we’re ready to fight. RPGs from our older days have taught us to always level-up and load up on health before facing the boss — it’s nice that this open-world gameplay accommodates this need. Let me add a few words here to appreciate recent games (like Legend of Zelda) for having confidence in our abilities and giving us the option to fight the boss whenever we want — although we weren’t really going to do it right away.

Intense action: The fictional “Bill of Rights” has been amended in the gameplay. Guns are for hire, people are for hire, and there is a variety of shiny vehicles (car/truck/copters/boats) to choose from — whatever you need to finish these missions and support the resistance movement. And if you ever need a break from all the combat, you could also go fishing on a lake, or chill to play an in-game arcade videogame.

"Samsung S9 review: A great camera, just like other phones",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/09/samsung-s9-review-a-great-camera-just-like-other-phones-1784446.html,"Friday, March 9, 2018 11:26 AM +0530","FILE- In this Feb. 25, 2018, file photo, a woman holds the new Galaxy S9 and S9 plus during the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2018 event on the eve of the Mobile World Congress wireless show in Barcelona, Spain. | AP

NEW YORK: Samsung says its new Galaxy S9 phone features a ""reimagined"" camera, and it is indeed pretty darned good. But you might not want to shell out $720 or more for one just yet unless your current phone is already close to death.

That's because other high-end phone cameras — nowadays, one of the major differentiators between phones — are also pretty darned good. If your phone is recent, it probably already has a decent camera. Technology has improved to the point that it's really hard to tell the difference between them.

In many of our test shots, the S9 outperformed the best of its rivals — Apple's iPhone X, Google's Pixel 2 XL and Samsung's own Galaxy Note 8. Photos had more detail and less distortion. But unless you magnify images for closer inspection, usually there's little obvious difference beyond color variation, which comes down to personal preference. In a few cases, the S9 performed worse than all three.

The phone comes out March 16 with a U.S. starting price of $720 through Samsung and T-Mobile and nearly $800 through other major U.S. carriers. Here's a look at what the S9 offers.

SEE THE LIGHT

In a first for a major smartphone, the S9 camera has an adjustable aperture, or lens opening, to let in more or less light. Low-light shots are also improved with software tricks that automatically take 12 shots in quick succession and blend the best of each.

These changes produce small improvements in shots: The evening sky tends to be darker, with less distortion. A statue of Abraham Lincoln doesn't look as grainy. Many S9 shots also have better contrast between dark and light areas.

But these differences are very subtle. What's more likely to affect picture quality is the steadiness of your hands.

FREEZING MOTION

The most distinctive feature in Samsung's new camera is super-slow-mo video. People appear frozen as they jump. Waterfalls seem at peace as drops trickle down. The feature offers a fresh perspective on that time-honored prank of having fake snakes pop out of a can — not so scary when the snakes float in thin air.

It's a gimmick, but loads of fun.

The camera can process only a fifth of a second of video at a time — stretched into six seconds when viewing — so auto detection is key to capturing the right moment. It's fun to see people jump up at this speed, but less so when the super-slow-mo part doesn't kick in until they're almost back on the ground. There's a lot of trial and error involved.

And compared with still images and regular video, super-slow-mo video tends to be darker and blurrier, particularly with close-ups. The feature is at its best outdoors, when lighting is good and the subject in motion is far enough away.

SAY WHAT?

Samsung's Bixby digital assistant taps the camera for instant translations. Just point the phone at a sign and see it in English (or your chosen language) with similar fonts and colors.

Bixby was more reliable at picking up text than a similar Google Lens feature on Pixel phones. But stop signs in Thai, Portuguese and French were translated as ""first,"" ''shield,"" and ""crazy."" Bixby got Indonesian right, though. And it can deal with long passages in posters and documents.

YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT

Point the camera at food for nutritional information. It gave me close-enough calorie counts for a burger and onion rings, but a roast beef sandwich was misidentified as either a pastrami or a cubano sandwich, depending on the angle.

All counts are based on single servings, which isn't as useful as Bixby telling me the mac and cheese I had was actually three servings, or triple the calories. Unreported calories don't contribute to weight gain, right?

WHAT ELSE

The larger S9 Plus model has a second lens with twice the magnification. Though I didn't test this model, a similar feature in other phones is essential for producing better close-ups.

Both S9 models have a feature for turning selfies into personal emojis for sharing in messages. Some people will love this; I found no use for it. Next!

The new phone is easier to unlock by looking at it. Past Samsung phones scan your iris, but they don't work reliably in bright sunlight. The S9 supplements that with facial recognition, which isn't as secure. For that reason, Samsung won't let banking and other sensitive apps use just the face, but it's OK for unlocking the phone (you can disable it if you're concerned). In any case, glasses can still be challenging, but there's a fingerprint sensor on the back as a backup. It's moved slightly to reduce smudges on the camera lens.

Beyond that, the phone's design hasn't changed much from last year's S8. But that's OK. No need to fix what isn't broken. What matters is what the phone does — and shoots.","FILE- In this Feb. 25, 2018, file photo, a woman holds the new Galaxy S9 and S9 plus during the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2018 event on the eve of the Mobile World Congress wireless show in Barcelona, Spain.

Smartphone addiction may signify a 'hyper-social' behaviour,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/09/smartphone-addiction-may-signify-a-hyper-social-behaviour-1784414.html,"Friday, March 9, 2018 10:10 AM +0530","TORONTO: Are you branded as anti-social for being glued to your smartphones? Take heart, for, according to a study, smartphone addiction could be a hyper-social behaviour that stems from the healthy human desire to socialise.

Researchers have found that besides the desire to watch and monitor others, the longing to be seen and monitored by others, runs deep in our evolutionary past.

Thus, the most addictive smartphone functions shared a common theme of tapping into the human desire to connect with other people.

Humans evolved to be a uniquely social species and require constant input from others to seek a guide for culturally appropriate behaviour that also paved a path for them to find meaning, goals, and a sense of identity.

""In post-industrial environments where foods are abundant and readily available, our cravings for fat and sugar sculpted by distant evolutionary pressures can easily go into insatiable overdrive and lead to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease (...) the pro-social needs and rewards (of smartphone use as a means to connect) can similarly be hijacked to produce a manic theatre of hyper-social monitoring,"" said Samuel Veissière, Professor at the McGill University in Canada.

While smartphones harness a normal and healthy need for sociality, the pace and scale of hyper-connectivity pushes the brain's reward system to run on overdrive, which can lead to unhealthy addictions, the researchers warned in a paper published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.

Turning off push notifications and setting up appropriate times to check your phone can go a long way to regain control over smartphone addiction.

Also, workplace policies ""that prohibit evening and weekend emails"" may provide good results, the researchers said.

In the study, the team reviewed current literature on dysfunctional use of smart technology through an evolutionary lens.","Take heart, for, according to a study, smartphone addiction could be a hyper-social behaviour that stems from the healthy human desire to socialise.

Women of the millennial are now moving outside their homes, be it for higher education, employment or post marriage. Travelling alone can be quite daunting, particularly at odd hours.

While the government bodies and law agencies aim to improve vigilance, there are technology players alongside who are also coming up with tech-based solutions and wearable devices that can ensure women safety.

This Women’s Day, here are some corporates and start-ups that have pledged to make travel a lot safer for women by offering shared mobility and smart navigation solutions:

Shared Mobility

Shuttl: Shuttl, a smart bus-based mobility solution is built to take the pain away from your daily commute and reduce congestion on roads. Shuttl’s SAFE solution includes several features, like face recognition software, GPS tracked and geo-fenced routes, the Shuttl buses are equipped with a physical and app-based SOS and panic button and unlike other shared mobility platforms, Shuttl’s Home Check feature initiates a confirmation call that ensures that the passengers have safely reached their destination.

Smart Navigation solutions

Google maps: Google Maps is known as one of the best navigation apps present, also, it has been the sole leader for a long time. This application provides various information like expected time of arrival (ETA), real-time traffic, nearest hotels, police stations, petrol pumps and so on, along with best routes for travel. With Google maps, women can keep track of their own location and know exactly where they are heading.

Safetipin: Safetipin, a crowdsourcing app, enables the user to check the safety of a particular place. There are various parameters on which the safety of a place is calculated like lighting, whether the location is deserted, are many women seen on the road, how is the walking path, how close can public transport be found. The app has other notable features which allow a friend or family member to track your location. This is beneficial for women who are going to a place for the first time or women traveling alone at odd hours during work. The user can also upload pictures and share their experience while visiting a particular part of the city which can be beneficial for other future visitors. With this application, women can record instances of harassment and security hazards, including broken street lights, open sewers and so on.","NEW DELHI: The safety of women has been accorded the highest priority in the recent past, owing to an increase in the crimes against women.

For the study, the researchers studied the carbon footprint of consumer devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, desktops as well as data centres and communication networks.

Their findings, published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, showed ICT has a greater impact on emissions than previously thought and most emissions come from production and operation.

""Today, it sits at about 1.5 per cent. If trends continue, ICT will account for as much as 14 per cent for the total global footprint by 2040, or about half of the entire transportation sector worldwide,"" said Lotfi Belkhir, Associate Professor at W Booth School of Engineering Practice and Technology, McMaster University, Canada.

""For every text message, for every phone call, every video you upload or download, there's a data centre making this happen. Telecommunications networks and data centres consume a lot of energy to serve you and most data centres continue to be powered by electricity generated by fossil fuels. It's the energy consumption we don't see,"" Belkhir added.

Among all the devices, trends suggest that by 2020, the most damaging devices to the environment will be smartphones.

While smartphones consume little energy to operate, 85 per cent of their emissions impact comes from production.

A smartphone's chip and motherboard require the most amount of energy to produce as they are made up of precious metals that are mined at a high cost, the study said.

Smartphones also have a short life which drives further production of new models and an extraordinary amount of waste.

""Anyone can acquire a smartphone, and telecommunications companies make it easy for people to acquire a new one every two years. We found that by 2020 the energy consumption of a smartphone is going to be more than that of PCs and laptops,"" Belkir said.

Belkir has made policy recommendations based on his findings.

""Communication and data centres have to go under renewable energy now. The good news is Google and Facebook data centres are going to run on renewable energy. But there needs to be a policy in place so that all data centres follow suit,"" Belkir said.

Apple's MacBook Air may get cheaper in second quarter,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/05/apples-macbook-air-may-get-cheaper-in-second-quarter-1782306.html,"Monday, March 5, 2018 01:09 PM +0530","SAN FRANSISCO: Apple is reportedly planning to launch a more affordable variant of the 13-inch MacBook Air in the second quarter of 2018, the media reported.

Apple is likely to release a new MacBook Air ""with a lower price tag"" during the second quarter of 2018, meaning we should see it sooner rather than later, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities was quoted as saying to 9to5mac on Saturday.

The analyst expects the more affordable MacBook Air will help push MacBook shipments up by 10-15 per cent this year.

MacBook Air, launched by then Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the MacWorld Expo in San Francisco in 2008, has not been updated since 2015 as Apple has shifted focus towards the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro.

The 13-inch MacBook Air, a popular choice for college students, is currently sold starting at $999 for 128GB of PCIe-based storage, a 1.8GHz dual-core i5 processor, and 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM.

The device last saw a minor update at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2017, with a slightly faster processor, and 8GB of RAM as a default.

Kuo says that KGI is ""positive"" on shipments of AirPods and predicts the refreshed model will come in the second half of the year, driving strong year over year growth.

Further, Kuo predicts on the entry-level 6.1-inch model of iPhones this year.

Kuo also notes that demand for HomePod has been ""mediocre"" thus far. Overall, demand for the smart speaker based on ""shipping time"" is ""neutral"", the report said.","SAN FRANSISCO: Apple is reportedly planning to launch a more affordable variant of the 13-inch MacBook Air in the second quarter of 2018, the media reported.

According to the Pew Research Centre, 68 per cent of all Americans use Facebook and three-quarters of those access the social media platform on a daily basis.

Nearly 74 per cent of adults use YouTube and 94 per cent of young users visit YouTube on their computers or smartphones.

With the exception of those 65 and older, a majority of Americans across a wide range of demographic groups now use Facebook.

""Younger Americans (especially those ages 18 to 24) stand out for embracing a variety of platforms and using them frequently. Some 78 per cent of 18- to 24-year-olds use Snapchat, and a sizeable majority of these users (71 per cent) visit the platform multiple times per day,"" the findings showed.

Similarly, 71 per cent of Americans in this age group now use Instagram and close to half (45 per cent) are Twitter users, the survey noted.

""These findings also highlight the public's sometimes conflicting attitudes toward social media. For example, the share of social media users who say these platforms would be hard to give up has increased by 12 percentage points compared with a survey conducted in early 2014,a the Pew Research Centre said.

By the same token, a majority of users (59 per cent) say it would not be hard to stop using these sites, including 29 per cent who say it would not be hard at all to give up social media.

Some 88 per cent of 18- to 29-year-olds indicate that they use any form of social media. That share falls to 78 per cent among those ages 30 to 49, to 64 per cent among those ages 50 to 64 and to 37 per cent among Americans 65 and older.

Pinterest remains substantially more popular with women -- 41 per cent -- than men (16 per cent).

LinkedIn remains especially popular among college graduates and those in high-income households.

""Some 50 per cent of Americans with a college degree use LinkedIn, compared with just 9 per cent of those with a high school diploma or less,"" the survey said.

New avatars,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/mar/03/new-avatars-1780738.html,"Saturday, March 3, 2018 07:57 PM +0530","Gadget makers tend to proclaim every reincarnation of a product they make as a pivotal moment in human history. Partly because they have to sell stuff and partly because they are impressed with their own cleverness. Like the timer added to a toaster as the greatest invention since sliced bread. The new alarm clock with the tiny touchscreen tacked on is a monolith from Kubrick’s space epic. But now as personal technology evolves, the time has begun for computers to begin seeing the world around them. And not just supercomputers. Even ordinary smartphones in everyone’s pockets.

The new iPhone X is the best example of this growth. In the tiny notch carved into the top of its screen is a camera that can recognise faces. Not just any face from the “likes” of photos on Facebook, but human faces in their 3D glory, with all the warts. Megacorps like Apple, Google and Samsung continue to dominate the race. Gizmos are getting more exotic as competition smarts up; the best ones are for health and home—a globally connected workout machine, a Bluetooth denim jacket, a robotic dog that can recognise faces, electronic personal assistants and more. For travellers, there are translation devices, autonomously moving suitcases, remote control vacuum cleaners to make being on the move better. Refrigerators tell you who is at the front door and gamers can multitask on many screens. The new plan is clear. To make the world one, everything will stay connected from now on.

Phones

iPhone X(From Rs 89,000)

On the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the most revolutionary consumer electronic device ever, there were doubts about Apple’s ability to innovate. Apple’s answer was the iPhone X. The jewel-like phone has two flagship features that make its users feel as if they are living in the future. The first is an edge-to-edge screen without any distracting bezels, with a massive 5.8-inch display in a gadget that is only slightly bigger than the iPhone 7. The second new feature is face recognition technology, dubbed Face ID. Unlike similar technologies in other phones that take photos of faces to unlock and so are easily hacked, Face ID captures over 30,000 IR dots on the user’s face to make an intricate map. Not to mention the sophisticated cameras, wireless charging and super fast speeds to make the X the best smartphone on the market.

OnePlus 5T (From Rs 32,999)

If you want the polish and performance of flagship Apple and Samsung phones at half the price in an Android phone, look no further than OnePlus and its newest version, the OnePlus 5T with a 6-inch display. The small size of bezels on the top and the bottom makes the grip easy. The well-polished Android rendition named the Oxygen OS makes for a pleasant user experience. The aluminium unibody is available in ‘Midnight Black’ and ‘Sandstone White’ with a ceramic finger print scanner on the back.

You also get access to Dash charging, which gives you a day’s worth of charge in just half an hour. Available with either 6GB or 8 GB of RAM, it is also one of the fastest Android phones available.

Music

Sennheiser HD 820(Approx. Rs 1,50,000)

Headphones are constantly upping their game to satisfy the dedicated audiophile. Sennheiser believes it has changed the game with HD 820 closed back dynamic stereo headphones. The company’s biggest innovation is a glass-inducer cover made out of gorilla glass, which minimises resonances giving the listener a realistic and natural sound field. It comes with a metal headband with an inner damping element, silver-clad OFC cables, gold-plated plugs and ear pads handcrafted in Germany. In case you wondered what a gorilla glass is, it is super thin, light-resistant and damage-resistant.

Apple HomePod(Approx. Rs 25,000)

Apple continues to enjoy big moments. The HomePod brings its unique i-design language, superior audio quality skills and own AI assistant, Siri, to living rooms. It will be in shops in the next few months, in both black and white, boasting high technology features such as upward-facing woofers, a six-microphone array, a seven-tweeter array—all wrapped in a seamless mesh fabric. But what sets the HomePod apart from the Google Home and the Amazon Echo is its spatial awareness. The device even changes its music delivery to suit the room and also segues with other HomePods nearby.

WEARABLES

L’Oréal La Roche-Posay UV Sense (Price TBA)

The first wearable gizmo from fashion giant L’Oréal, the UV Sense will tell you how long you have spent in the sun. Packed with sensors and NFC technology, it works by syncing data with either your Android or iPhone to give you a detailed breakdown on its dedicated app. Small enough to stick on a nail, it will give you the right score about the time UV rays ravaged your skin. During the initial set-up of the app, please give all details about your skin tone. As the amount of sun a person’s skin can handle vary, the score depends on your skin tone. And since it is L’Oréal, the gadget will not only give you advice depending on your skin score, but will also try to sell you their anti-sun products.

Levi’s Jacquard by Google (Approx. Rs 23,000)

Google has partnered with Levi’s to show off their smart fabric technology. Levi’s Jacquard is a denim jacket with controls on its sleeve. It works with both Android phones and iPhones, and lets you know of incoming calls or messages through haptic feedback, reads out the messages, enables you to send calls to voicemail, announce navigation prompts turn by turn, and of course lets you choose your music. Using a USB port, power can last up to two weeks on a single charge. But use deos: the thingamajig can be washed only 10 times in its lifetime. Welcome to wearing your world on your sleeve.

KIDS

Sony Aibo

The old robot dog has new tricks like OLED panels for eyes, cameras on its nose and touch sensors on the chin, head and back which make it respond to petting and cuddles. With face recognition tech, it even distinguishes between owners. Wow Bow!

My Special Aflac Duck

This is a companion robot for kids with illnesses like cancer. Through naturalistic movement, a companion app to explore the duck’s virtual world and through distinct emotions, it helps comfort children.

TRAVEL

Travis the Translator(Approx. Rs 15,000)

This tech polyglot is a puck-sized, black pebble with a screen that lets you translate 80 languages while on the hoof. By having a standalone device, you supposedly save on battery life of your smartphone, as Travis works for 12 hours after being juiced up just once. With noise cancellation mics, Travis works easy in the most noisy outdoor areas. Using AI and machine learning to improve its translating chops, the more you use it, the better it gets. Operating both offline and online, the accessory even works in places where you would be too afraid to take your expensive phone.

CX-1 Smart Suitcase (Price TBA)

Self-driving cars are still in the experimental garage, but self-driving suitcases are here. The CX-1 Smart Suitcase made by Chinese company ForwardX has a 170-degree wide-angle camera and radar to look around and sense objects around. Using real-time recognition and tracing algorithms, CX-1 follows its owner autonomously. Because the wheels are rubber, it can move freely over soft and rough surfaces. You also get a Bluetooth wristband to stay connected with the “world’s first self-driving carry-on”. If both of you are separated, your smart suitcase will ping you its location. And it even has a thief alert! It’s not just clothes and your toothbrush it is packed with: the CX-1 has GPS tracking, a smart lock, and a built-in socket to charge your cell phone.

GAMING

ASUS ROG Swift PG65 (Price TBA)

Serious gamers often find themselves shifting between PCs and TVs to watch separate content or to stream games to different users. ASUS ROG Swift PG65 seems made just for them. For starters, it comes with a massive 65-inch screen that can be hooked up to any PC. Its 4,000 resolution screen with a 120HZ refresh rate that supports HDR content, the games pop up with the most vivid details. And wait, the doodad’s screen is more than just a screen. Tucked away behind is an Nvidia Shield that makes it double as an Android TV. So play games on it, even streaming them on Twitch without ever having to move or switch screens and watch Netflix as well to multitask your enjoyment.

Nintendo Switch (From Rs 32,490)

Nintendo Switch is one of the most versatile gaming consoles on the market. Out of the box, it comes with a tablet-size screen, two removable controllers called Joy-Cons on either side and a docking station. So if you are on the move, attach the controllers to the screen and just play. At home, drop the screen in the dock and connect it to your TV. Having friends over? Use the built-in stand to prop up the screen on a table and watch. By attaching the included Joy-Con grip, the two individual controllers come together to turn into a traditional game controller. The controllers themselves have haptic feedback called HD rumble, enabling your hands to feel every action that happens in the game.

Fitness

Peloton Tread (Approx. Rs 2,60,000)

This mini home workout studio comes with a 32-inch touch screen that helps you get help from the experts in the company’s New York studios for everything from running, to interval training to even yoga. With a state-of-the-art rubber slat belt and easy-to-use controls for changing both speed and incline, Peloton Tread also shows you in-depth, real-time workout metrics such as heart rate and elevation. The touchscreen also comes with powerful stereo speakers that make the toughest jog a walk in the park.

Apple Watch Series 3 Nike+ Edition (From Rs 29,900)

For fitness tracking, the Apple Watch is the best gizmo in the market. And when it comes to helping you stay fit, there is nothing better than Nike+. A combination of the two means Apple Watch’s latest Nike+ edition is the best tool you can count on to keep you fit. It has built-in GPS and altimeter for outdoor runs; gym equipment sync for indoor runs; and by being swim-proof, there is no worry being in many laps of luxury. The latest edition of the series also comes with the Nike+ Run Club app, which is the perfect companion for anyone on the run.

HOME

Lenovo Smart Display (From Rs 13,000)

When Google engineers wanted to create a smart home assistant with a touchscreen, they came up with the Lenovo Smart Display. Available in 8-inch and 10-inch sizes and in soft grey or bamboo finishes, Smart Display comes loaded with Google Assistant. It is capable of doing everything a smart assistant is supposed to do like answering questions, playing music, checking weather, reading the news etc. It can play YouTube videos and let you make video calls using Google Duo and also act as a smart hub for other smart gadgets in your home.

Neato Botvac Connected (Approx. Rs 63,000)

Botvac, the robot vacuum cleaner, connects to your home WiFi and can be controlled from anywhere in the world. Its unique D-shape allows it into tight corners, and the exclusive LaserSmart technology maps your house with all the furniture and floor levels. Capable of cleaning up to 5,000 sq ft in a single cycle, it sends notifications once it is done. Using the corresponding app, you can set up its cleaning schedules. Though why one would want to vacuum the house while away on holiday is anyone’s guess.

Samsung Family Hub Refrigerator (Approx. Rs 2,11,065)

The Korean electronics giant has improved on its Family Hub Bixby with an intelligent voice assistant and connected home controls. It’s a family’s home digital controller, which will tell you the amount of food in the fridge, give recipes, seamlessly connect with hundreds of compatible devices, see who is ringing the door bell, adjust the thermostat, check on a sleeping baby in the next room and more.

Nest X Yale Lock(Price TBA)

Expected to launch this month after much experimenting for two years, the smart lock Google Nest, made in collaboration with Yale, has no keys. Instead, it has a battery-powered (four AA ones) entry system with a touch-screen, and can store up to 250 passcodes, which can be customised according to users. The lock can be remote controlled using the Nest app.

Pc

Razer Project Linda(Price TBA)

Last year, Razer introduced a powerful mobile phone, which now has been combined with its most powerful gaming laptop. The 13.3-inch Quad HD touchscreen has been fitted inside a laptop shell with a visible hole where traditionally trackpads go. The Razer phone neatly docks into that space, not only to act as a touch screen trackpad but also powers the laptop to give the user the best of both the worlds. The built-in keyboard has Android buttons and backlit keys glowing in RGB colours. The laptop also doubles up as a power bank for the phone and has 200GB storage to store offline phone backups, apps and games.

iMac Pro (From Rs 4,15,000)

Desk machines for niche professionals such as filmmakers, musicians and game developers need to be powerful. Hence they can be large, clunky computers that go for function over form. Apple is changing all that. Instead of upgrading its Mac Pro lineup, the company has integrated a most powerful computer with the sleek iMac design. In the process, Apple also painted it black. With a 5K, 27-inch screen, Xeon processors that go up to 18 cores, up to 22 terraflops of graphics performance, 128GB ECC memory and 4TB of SSD storage, the new iMac Pro is one of the most powerful, yet most beautiful computers ever built.","The jewel-like phone has two flagship features that make its users feel as if they are living in the future.

The new feature was first spotted by an Indian user and the social media giant is testing ""Voice Clips"" as a status update option with a small percentage of users in the country.

""More intimate than text but easier to record than video, Facebook hopes voice could get people sharing more on its aging social network. And internationally, where users may have to deal with non-native language keyboards, voice lets them speak their mind without a typing barrier,"" TechCrunch reported on Saturday.

""We are always working to help people share and connect with their friends and family on Facebook in ways that are authentic to them. Voice Clips gives people a new medium through which to express themselves,"" a Facebook spokesperson was quoted as saying by TechCrunch.

However, it is not yet known if the feature would be rolled out globally.

The social media giant is getting more serious about voice-enabled features and it is already working on smart home speakers named Fiona and Aloha which are reportedly slated to launch around July.

Designed by Facebook's Building 8 hardware lab, the Aloha model is reportedly more sophisticated than Fiona.

""The Aloha model, to be marketed under the official name Portal, will use voice commands but will also feature facial recognition to identify users for accessing Facebook via a wide-angle lens on the front of the device,"" a Digitimes report said.

It is seeking the help of users in improving what it calls the ""conversational health"" so that it ceases to become a platform for abuse, spam and manipulation.

""We're committing to helping increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation around the world, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable toward progress,"" Twitter said in a blog post this week.

""We simply can't and don't want to do this alone,"" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted.

Those who are interested in helping it define what health means for Twitter and how it should approach measuring it, they can submit a proposal by filling up a form posted on Twitter's official blog by April 13.

Twitter said its health will be built and measured by how it helps encourage more healthy debate, conversations, and critical thinking.

""We are looking to partner with outside experts to help us identify how we measure the health of Twitter, keep us accountable to share our progress with the world and establish a way forward for the long-term,"" the post reads.

Twitter mentioned works of Cortico, a US-based non-profit research organisation, as one of its inspirations.

Cortico has developed four indicators to measure conversational health -- shared attention, shared reality, a variety of opinion, and receptivity.

""We believe that we can identify indicators of conversational health that are even more specific to Twitter and its impact,"" Twitter said.

""We don't have all of the answers and cannot do this alone, but know that the outcome will be stronger when we look to experts around the world for counsel and support,"" it added.

Twitter said that successful applicants will collaborate directly with Twitter's team, receive public data access and meaningful funding for their research.

EU Competition Commissioner Margarethe Vestager in June slapped Google with a record 2.4-billion-euro (more than $2.7 billion) penalty for illegally favouring its shopping service in search results.

This was one of a series of dust-ups between Brussels and Google over alleged monopolistic practices, with Vestager still expected to decide a case involving the company's Android mobile phone operating system.

To avoid further penalities, Google formally offered its solution in September, proposing among other fixes to run the contested shopping service as a standalone business.

""Google's current remedy proposal has been in operation for more than four months, and the harm to competition, consumers and innovation ... has continued unabated,"" wrote a long list of complainants against Google in a letter to Vestager.

""We respectfully urge the Commission to reject Google’s current remedy proposal,"" it added.

The fine in June came after seven years of investigation launched by complaints from other price-comparison services that lost 90 percent of traffic against Google Shopping, according to the European Commission.

Solicited by AFP, the Commission said it will ""listen to what those most directly affected by the practices in question have to say.""

It added that it was ""monitoring closely and actively (though) it would be premature at this stage for the Commission to take any definite positions on Google's plans.""

Brussels had accused Google of giving its own service too much priority in search results to the detriment of other price comparison services.

The remedy by Google invited other comparison services to auction for display space on Google search results.

The firm also separated its Google Shopping unit from the main company so that it participates like any other company in the auction for display space.

Google is also appealing the fine at EU court.","BRUSSELS: Rivals to Google urged the EU on Wednesday to keep up its fight against the search engine giant, saying proposals by the firm to avoid more EU mega-fines fell short.

Samsung launches new S9 phone with augmented reality features,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/feb/26/samsung-launches-new-s9-phone-with-augmented-reality-features-1779003.html,"Monday, February 26, 2018 08:30 AM +0530","A hostess shows up Samsung's new S9 (R) and S9 Plus devices after a presentation ceremony at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona | Reuters

BARCELONA: Samsung unveiled its new flagship smartphone on Sunday with a focus on augmented reality features as it seeks to keep its title as the world's biggest smartphone maker.

The South Korean firm showcased the Galaxy S9 on the eve of the official start of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, which comes after a year of flat smartphone sales.

With no other major handset maker using the annual event, the world's largest phone show, to launch a new flagship device this year, Samsung had the opportunity to grab the spotlight.

The S9 features essentially the same design as last year's previous flagship, with the full screen and curved glass edge of the S8, which was followed by Apple's iPhone X and others.

But it includes louder sound, a faster processor and software that turns selfies into animated emojis, which will appeal to consumers who are increasingly preferring to use their phones to send text messages rather than talking.

Samsung also included a dual lense camara on the Galaxy S line for the first time, which will improve low-light capture and enhance slow motion video, which is popular on social media.

A service powered by artificial intelligence (AI) allows users to point its camera to instantly translate a sign in a foreign language.

It is also one of the few flagship phones left that still comes with a standard headphone jack.

""Despite these incremental innovations, Samsung will have to smartly leverage its brand and marketing machine to correctly position the new smartphones to a target audience,"" said Forrester analyst Thomas Husson.

Global smartphone sales fell by 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter due to slower than expected Christmas sales, according to research firm IDC.

Overall global smartphone sales for 2017 were virtually flat -- down 0.1 percent at 1.47 billion units -- as phone makers struggled to come up with innovations that encourage customers to upgrade their devices.

Cost concerns -

Samsung suffered a humiliating recall of its Galaxy Note 7 device in 2016 after several devices exploded, but its Galaxy 8 smartphone was a consumer and critical success.

While it kept its lead over Apple as the world's biggest seller of smartphones in 2017 with a 21.6 percent market share, up from 21.1 percent in the previous year, Samsung faces stiffer competition from Chinese rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi that offer cheaper handsets with many high-end features.

The S9 will sell for 859 euros ($1,055), a price which analysts warned could turn off many consumers.

While the S9's camera is ""markedly different"" in quality from older smartphones that people already own ""consumers may delay purchase because of rising flagship prices,"" IHS Markit said in a research note.

""Samsung must work hard to market the benefits of these designs to counter negative pricing perception.""

Huawei unveiled a new laptop and tablet in Barcelona earlier on Sunday but will present its new flagship smartphone -- the P20 -- on March 27 in Paris.

Thomas said this will allow it to ""fine tune its marketing message based on how the new Samsung S9 devices are perceived by consumers"".

Earlier on Sunday South Korea's LG unveiled the V30S -- an updated version of its flagship V30 smartphone launched six months ago -- which features higher memory and artificial intelligence-based technologies that focus on photos and voice recognition.

More than 100,000 people are expected to descend on Barcelona for the annual show, which features driverless carmakers, social media giants and chip companies in addition to handset makers.","A hostess shows up Samsung's new S9 (R) and S9 Plus devices after a presentation ceremony at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona | ReutersBARCELONA: Samsung unveiled its new flagship smartphone on Sunday with a focus on augmented reality features as it seeks to keep its title as the world's biggest smartphone maker.

Hyperloop: A promise or a hype?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/feb/22/hyperloop-a-promise-or-a-hype-1777426.html,"Friday, February 23, 2018 12:43 PM +0530","CHENNAI: Hyperloop is the latest buzz in the town. Sir Richard Branson, the CEO of the LA-based Virgin Hyperloop One touched down in Mumbai last week. There, he signed an MoU with the Maharashtra government to build the world’s first Hyperloop.

Things began speeding up soon afterwards. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the project’s foundation stone at the Magnetic Maharashtra Global Business Summit on Monday.

Once operational, the Hyperloop will link the cities of Mumbai and Pune. The travel time between them will shrink to a mere 25 minutes from the present three-and-half hours.

However, it’s not all that easy. Technical challenges and huge cost involved in building a Hyperloop have given many second thoughts about its viability.

What is Hyperloop?

Hyperloop is a futuristic mode of transport proposed by LA-based billionaire investor Elon Musk in 2012. In Hyperloop, pods or containers will carry people at speeds over 1000 km/hr through a low-pressure tube. Musk called it the fifth mode of transport -- the other four being rail, road, air, and water. ​

How does it work?

The pods or containers will float through the tube using magnetic levitation technology. Put simply, magnetic levitation is the use of magnetic force to lift an object and propel it forward. Magnets have two oppositely polarised ends - North and South. Two poles that are similar repel each other and vice versa. This property of magnets is used to push and pull the pods forwards.

The technique has been around for quite some time and is presently used to levitate and float the high-speed Maglev rail networks across Europe.

How does it help? The pods don’t come in touch with any surface. This ensures that there is no friction. When the wheels of a train hurtle through a track, it generates a significant amount of friction, which drags the train, leading to increased energy consumption. Pods don’t have to deal with friction as they float through a low-pressure tube.

Also, the tubes are pumped to near vacuum. This means that there is very little air pressure, and thus, almost no resistance to the forward movement of pods. The absence of friction and air pressure enables the pods to travel at much greater speed than a train running through a track.

How does it help?

The biggest advantage of Hyperloop is that it saves times. But what about money? Every day, nearly 1.5 lakh vehicles travel from Pune to Mumbai. Hyperloop will not only reduce traffic congestion on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, but also cut down on carbon emission by 150,000 tonnes annually, claims Virgin Hyperloop One.

Economic benefits are also abounding. Richard Branson, the CEO of the Virgin Hyperloop One has claimed that the economic benefits accrued to India due to time and energy saved and increased productivity would amount to Rs 3.5 lakh crore over 30 years. There is no way to test his claim as the world is yet to have its first operational Hyperloop system.

Also, high-speed commute means one could travel from his/her home in Pune to workplace in Mumbai in a matter of less than half an hour. This may reduce the housing congestion in Mumbai and might help bring down the cost of housing there.

Moreover, faster connectivity will help cities push their frontiers and accelerate the pace of their economic growth. For instance, businesses and manufacturers catering to Pune would benefit if the city becomes a key residential hub for those working in Mumbai. Also, it would become a key investment destination. Businessmen, eager to cash in on Pune’s expanding middle class, would throng to the city, leading to its expansion.

Will it benefit an average person?

We don’t know yet. Richard Branson aims to make Hyperloops affordable for everyone. “We are not pricing this for the wealthy, but it will be for the masses,” he said. Experts are skeptical though. To begin with, it is still a concept that has not yet been successfully implemented. So, it is not easy to get a realistic estimate.

Last year, the US Department of Transportation noted in a feasibility study that the “Cost estimates for a land-based Hyperloop system may appear lower than other modes, but as the technology is still conceptual and in very initial testing, there is uncertainty in both the underlying infrastructure needed to operate a system and the cost to construct it.”

Estimates vary, but almost everyone agrees that the capital cost for a project of this scale would be very huge. Just how huge? Leaked documents from Hyperloop One puts the cost at $120 million or Rs 780 crore per mile. In other words, building a 100-mile-long (160 km) Hyperloop system would cost approximately seventy-eight thousand crore rupees.

Anybody investing so much money into a project would want to recover it in the long run. Although Elon Musk claimed that the ticket for a journey between L.A. and San Francisco could be priced as low as $20 (Rs 1300), many believe this would be a bad idea, if the Hyperloop is to be profitable for the investor.

Many academics have also come forward expressing their skepticism about the project’s financial viability. Bent Flyvbjerg, an economist specialising in mega-projects at Oxford University agrees that it would be extremely difficult to make such a project financially viable. Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard University echoes Flyvbjerg. “It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision,” he says.

Is it technically viable?

Cost aside, technological challenges pose major hurdles. The idea of a pod floating through a near-vacuum tube is not very far fetched. But there are numerous other issues that need to be tackled. “The biggest concern with this plan has to do with temperature. The pod will be compressing air and expelling it downwards and backward. All that air compression creates an enormous amount of heat, which can damage the pod and its machinery,” writes Sam Jaffe, Managing Director of Cairn Energy Research Advisors.

Further, constructing and maintaining a 150-km long low-pressure tube would be a significant challenge. According to Dr. Phil Mason, a former chemist at Cornell University, maintaining a long vacuum tube would be a nearly impossible task. He says the air from outside would push against the walls of the near-vacuum tube “with a force of roughly 10 tons per square meter.” “That’s a huge amount of force to place on a steel wall of less than one-inch thickness and almost no air inside,” he says.

Experts fear new challenges would present themselves once the engineers set themselves to the task of building the world’s first Hyperloop. ​

Is it safe for humans?

Well, nobody knows for sure. Scientists worry that since pods travel at near subsonic speed, passengers would have to withstand a tremendous amount of G-force. At that speed, even a small curve in the tube would produce so much centrifugal force that most riders would end up sick. One must wait and see if people would walk out of the pods like zombies dead walking in Hollywood films.","Sir Richard Branson, the CEO of the LA-based Virgin Hyperloop One touched down in Mumbai last week.
Technical challenges and huge cost involved in building a Hyperloop have given many second thoughts about its viability.
In Hyperloop, pods or containers will carry people at speeds over 1000 km/hr through a low-pressure tube.
Hyperloop will not only reduce traffic congestion on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, but also cut down on carbon emission by 150,000 tonnes annually, claims Virgin Hyperloop One.

SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook has rolled out a new feature in both iOS and Android apps that can allow users to add more friends and family members to a live audio and video chats in Messenger.

With the update, users need not hang up and manually add people into a conversation before restarting the call.

""We're excited to share a small new feature that will hopefully have a big impact to make your video and audio chats easier and faster than ever,"" Sarah Morris, Product Manager of Messenger, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday.

Earlier, to turn a one-on-one video or audio chat into a group chat, users had to hang up, start a new conversation from your inbox -- either by creating an entirely new message or by searching for an old one -- and then turn that conversation into a call.

While in a video chat or on a voice call, tap the screen, select the ""add person"" icon and choose who you want to join.

All the filters and effects would be available and after the chat ends, a group chat is created automatically in a user's inbox.

Users need to download the latest version of Messenger to get the feature.

South Korean chat app becomes new outlet for #MeToo movement,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/feb/22/south-korean-chat-app-becomes-new-outlet-for-metoo-movement-1777233.html,"Thursday, February 22, 2018 11:49 AM +0530","SEOUL: A chat app where South Koreans can anonymously dish the dirt on their misbehaving bosses and colleagues is belatedly stirring the country's #MeToo movement, shedding new light on sexual harassment in the heavily male-dominated corporate culture.

Prompted by a recent wave of complaints about workplace misconduct, including a groping allegation made by a South Korean public prosecutor last month - the app Blind has added a new feature: a message board dedicated to a rising number of #MeToo stories.

""We thought the prosecutor going public would put fresh momentum in the #MeToo movement in South Korea and our #MeToo board was definitely inspired by her action,"" Kim Sungkyum, co-founder at Blind's creator TeamBlind said.

Koreans are wary of being whistleblowers about harassment at family-run conglomerates or chaebol that dominate South Korean business.

Their big fear: the companies will turn on them for rocking the boat and they will be victimized again.

Some 61 percent of South Korean respondents working at private companies said they would bypass in-house whistleblower hotlines, saying they didn't trust their organisation to keep complaints confidential, according to a survey by consulting firm EY.

That was significantly higher than the Asia-Pacific average of 37 percent.

Instead, South Koreans are turning to Blind, which now has over a million users in the world's most wired country.

""Employees are reluctant to use internal bulletins for fear of reprisals which is part of our country's corporate culture,"" said a banker at a South Korean state run bank who uses the app.

""I think Blind can make people talk more freely, which can't be controlled by their companies."" In less than 24 hours after the launch of the #MeToo board on Blind more than 500 posts were uploaded, making the app intermittently unavailable due to heavy traffic, the app's operator says.

By Thursday, the board had swelled with more than 1,600 posts, prompting conversations about workplace sexual misconduct ranging from cracking sexist jokes to making unwelcome physical advances.

GENDER INEQUALITY

Blind says it encodes personal data and information to protect users' privacy, and users must use their company email for verification.

When the app first came out four years ago, several companies requested Blind take down posts that might be damaging to their reputation.

TeamBlind says it has not taken down any posts at a company's request and has not faced any lawsuits for material posted on its message boards.

TeamBlind said it does reviews posts and has removed some that violated its terms of use, including publishing statements that might be defamatory or breach individuals' privacy.

Globally, the #MeToo movement has exposed men accused of sexual assault and harassment in fields including entertainment, politics and business.

Dozens of prominent men have quit or been fired from high-profile posts, and police have opened investigations into some accusations of sex assault.

But it was slower to catch on in South Korea, which ranked 118 out of 144 on gender equality last year, according to the World Economic Forum.

OUTCRY, BOYCOTTS

In the case of the public prosecutor, who said her boss groped her at a funeral in 2010 - the Supreme Prosecutors' Office launched an inquiry into her allegations.

The investigation is ongoing but the Prosecutor General has promised to take action to combat sexual harassment in the workplace.

In another incident late last year, South Korean furniture maker Hanssem publicly apologised after a post detailing a female employee's experiences of workplace sexual abuse went viral, sparking a boycott of the company's products.

Earlier this month, posts made on Blind said chairman of the group that owns Asiana Airlines had made inappropriate physical contact with female flight attendants.

Last week, Park Sam-koo, chairman of the airliner's parent Kumho Asiana Group, issued an apology over the allegations, saying ""it was all my carelessness and responsibility"".

Park did not respond for requests for comment, and the company said it had taken no action against him.

Despite the increased awareness, many South Korean Blind users say they are yet to see significant changes in their workplaces.

""Through Blind, I have come to realize there are so many things that need to be corrected in my company. But I haven't seen any sweeping change yet,"" said another user who said he was working for a major conglomerate.

One of the most common spam violations is the use of multiple accounts and the Twitter developer platform to artificially amplify or inflate the prominence of certain tweets.

""Twitter prohibits any attempt to use automation for the purposes of posting or disseminating spam, and such behaviour may result in enforcement action,"" the company said in a blog post on Thursday.

The company is making changes to TweetDeck and the Twitter API to limit the ability of users to perform coordinated actions across multiple accounts.

Users of TweetDeck will no longer be able to select multiple accounts through which to perform an action such as tweeting, retweeting, liking or following.

""These changes are an important step in ensuring we stay ahead of malicious activity targeting the crucial conversations taking place on Twitter -- including elections in the United States and around the world,"" said Yoel Roth who handles API Policy at Twitter.

Twitter cautioned not to simultaneously post identical or substantially similar content to multiple accounts.

""For example, your service should not permit a user to select several accounts they control from which to publish a given Tweet,"" the post read.

As an alternative to posting identical content, you can retweet content from one account from the other accounts you wish to share that post from.

""This should only be done from a small number of distinct accounts that you directly control. Please note that bulk, aggressive, or very high-volume automated retweeting is not permitted under the Automation Rules, and may be subject to enforcement actions,"" Roth warned.

""If your app or service includes features which allow users to perform simultaneous actions across multiple accounts, you should make changes to bring it into compliance with this policy by March 23,"" Twitter said.","SAN FRANCISCO: In yet another attempt to fight spam on its platform, Twitter has announced a new set of guidelines that will prohibit bots from posting mass tweets as well as prevent automated tweets.

It also opens the door for a future where people can bring interesting objects and experiences with them across Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), mobile and web,"" Facebook wrote in a blog late on Tuesday.

Facebook recently introduced 3D posts to let people see and interact with a digital object from all sides in Facebook News Feed.

With ""glTF 2.0"" compliance that comes with the support for textures, lighting and realistic rendering techniques, developers can now build game or movie characters, architectural models or museum artefacts from rough to shiny, metallic to soft -- all beautifully detailed 3D art on Facebook.

The social media giant also introduced new Graph API endpoints with 3D Post support so developers can build seamless 3D sharing into any app -- letting people share interactive objects or scenes directly to Facebook with just a click.

Using the new ""Open Graph"" tag, developers can enable 3D content from their website to automatically appear in 3D when shared on Facebook. Artists using 3D authoring software can directly drag/drop their 3D files to Facebook to create a 3D post.

Facebook's early partners, including Sony, Lego, among others, have already implemented new ways to share 3D content on the platform.

""AI offers us the potential for new, less invasive tests for heart health -- predicting cardiovascular results from retinal images with computer vision -- encouraging early results!,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on Tuesday while referring the study in a tweet.



The study, published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering, showed that deep learning applied to a retinal fundus image, a photograph that includes the blood vessels of the eye, can predict risk factors for heart diseases -- from blood pressure to smoking status.



The algorithm that the researchers produced can even help predict the occurrence of a future major cardiovascular event on par with current measures, said Michael McConnell, Head of Cardiovascular Health Innovations at Verily in blog post.



Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally and researchers know that lifestyle factors including exercise and diet in combination with genetic factors, age, ethnicity, and sex all contribute to it.



However, they do not exactly know how these factors add up in a particular individual, and so in some patients it becomes essential to perform sophisticated tests, like coronary calcium CT scans, to help better stratify an individual's risk for having a heart attack or a stroke, and such other cardiovascular events.



In this study, using deep learning algorithms trained on data from 284,335 patients, the researchers were able to predict cardiovascular risk factors from retinal images with surprisingly high accuracy for patients from two independent datasets of 12,026 and 999 patients.



The algorithm could distinguish the retinal images of a smoker from that of a non-smoker 71 per cent of the time, the study found.



""In addition, while doctors can typically distinguish between the retinal images of patients with severe high blood pressure and normal patients, our algorithm could go further to predict the systolic blood pressure within 11 mmHg on average for patients overall, including those with and without high blood pressure,"" study co-author Lily Peng, Product Manager, Google Brain Team, said.



""One of the exciting aspects of this study is the generation of 'attention maps' to show which aspects of the retina contributed most to the algorithm, thus providing a window into the 'black box' often associated with machine learning,"" McConnell, who is also a co-author of the study, said.



This can give clinicians greater confidence in the algorithm, and potentially provide new insights into retinal features not previously associated with cardiovascular risk factors or future risk, McConnell said.



The findings suggest that a simple retinal image could one day help understand the health of a patient's blood vessels, key to cardiovascular health.



""This is promising, but early research -- more work must be done to develop and validate these findings on larger patient cohorts before this can arrive in a clinical setting,"" McConnell added.","SAN FRANCISCO: Knowing the risk of a heart attack or a stroke could soon become as simple as an eye test as researchers at Google and its health-tech arm Verily have found that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) could help identify signals of heart diseases through retinal images.

Google enables utility bill payments on Tez,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/feb/19/google-enables-utility-bill-payments-on-tez-1775677.html,"Monday, February 19, 2018 04:33 PM +0530","Currently, there are no charges for transactions done on Tez.

NEW DELHI: Google India on Monday announced that via its digital payments app, Tez, users can pay their bills within minutes, without any transaction charges.

Starting with support for more than 80 billers, including national and state electricity providers, gas, water, DTH and mobile postpaid bills and recharge. The new bill pay feature will include major utilities like Reliance Energy, BSES and DishTV, and in total will cover all states and major metros in India.

For recurring bill payments, Tez will send users you a timely notification when their bill arrives, and users will be able to check whether they have paid a bill by simply tapping the biller’s name on their Tez home screen.

It will enable users to view all past payments grouped by bill, as well as manage bills from multiple accounts. Built to support Bharat BillPay system, for most utilities Tez will also let users get an alert when a new bill comes in.

“Today, we are adding a specially designed bill pay experience in Tez which will enable users to make a wide range of bill payments including electricity, water, gas, DTH, and insurance from the app. We hope that users will like the simplicity and time saving with the new bill pay experience on Tez,” said Diana Layfield, VP, Payments and Commerce, Next Billion Users.

Customers will see different billers depending on their city and region, and users can also search for them by name. Once users have located their biller, they need to enter the number associated with their account to link it to Tez and give it an easy name to remember.

Once users have linked their account, for most utility bills Tez will automatically fetch any available bills. Users need to just tap on New Payment and then pay bills.

Built on the Indian government-supported Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Tez is a simple and secure mobile app for digital payments, built with the goal of making digital payments as easy as using cash.

Tez’s Cash Mode securely sends money from person to person with just a few taps. By pressing and holding the Cash Mode buttons at the same time, two people using Tez are able to make a secure transaction in seconds without needing to share private details like phone numbers or account numbers. This happens through Google’s proprietary Audio QR (AQR) ultrasound technology. Recipients receive the amount deposited to their bank account instantly.

Tez syncs with the contact list in users’ phones, in accordance with their privacy settings. This way, users can start a transaction just by searching for a friend’s name or phone number. Once a contact is on Tez, users do not have to add beneficiaries or enter bank account number and IFSC codes. If the other person is not on Tez or in the phone contact list, then users can still pay them with their bank account number or UPI ID. Transaction history with each person is grouped together like a conversation, thus making it easier to find a particular transaction.

Tez is accepted by businesses that accept UPI. It works with over 50 UPI-enabled banks, so that money stays in users’ bank accounts until they need to use it. Tez users continue to earn interest from their banks and have their deposits backed by bank security guarantees. Currently, there are no charges for transactions done on Tez.

The app is backed by multiple security levels, including dedicated security systems offered by Indian banks, the NPCI, and the Tez Shield — Google’s suite of security features, including a machine-learning-based fraud detection engine, device level protection, including a Google PIN, and no sharing of phone numbers or bank account numbers via Cash Mode.

The platform works on the vast majority of smartphones on both Android and iOS, in English and Hindi.

Scientists grow sheep embryos containing human cells,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/feb/19/scientists-grow-sheep-embryos-containing-human-cells-1775656.html,"Monday, February 19, 2018 03:45 PM +0530","WASHINGTON: In a breakthrough, scientists from the US and Japan have transferred human stem cells into sheep embryos, an advance that may pave the way for growing transplant organs inside animals.



The hybrid embryos containing both human and sheep cells were created in an early step toward growing human organs in farm animals before transplanting them into patients, The Financial Times reported.



The new finding paves way for genetically tailoring the organs to be compatible with the immune system of the patient receiving them, thus removing the possibility of rejection, the report said.



Using stem cell and genomic editing technologies, human stem cells were successfully transferred into early sheep embryos, producing embryos for which about one in every 100,000 cells were human.



These chimeras -- a term adopted from Greek mythology -- were only allowed to develop for 28 days, the researchers said while presenting the results at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Texas.



The experiment began with Hiro Nakauchi, from the University of Tokyo, who grew a mouse with a rat pancreas and a rat with a mouse pancreas.



When cells from the rat-grown mouse pancreas were transplanted into a diabetic mouse, they made enough insulin to cure the condition without being rejected.



Mice and rats are different types of rodents with the former having thin slightly hairy tails, while rats have thicker hairless scaly tails.



""The next step was to move into large animals,"" Nakauchi said. Since this was prohibited in Japan, he moved to the Stanford University in the US.



Nakauchi's rodent work has demonstrated that you can ""grow organs in a different species and cure a disease without [suppressing the immune system],"" added co-researcher Pablo Ross, Professor at from the University of California, Davis.



""We are working together to translate the technology into humans, to solve the terrible shortage of organs for transplantation. In the US, 20 people die every day because they cannot get the organs they need,"" Ross explained.



The novel approach helps to produce animal embryos that are genetically incapable of growing a particular organ.



Then the embryos are injected with human stem cells. The overall proportion of human cells in the chimeric embryo may be small but, as it develops in the womb, the human cells fill the gap and produce the missing organ that the animal's own genes cannot create, the report said.



If the technology is able to grow human organs inside other species, organ transplants can become a possibility beyond critical conditions.



While it may take many years to develop chimeric transplant technology to the stage where it could be used safely on patient, ""things are moving fast,"" Ross said.

","WASHINGTON: In a breakthrough, scientists from the US and Japan have transferred human stem cells into sheep embryos, an advance that may pave the way for growing transplant organs inside animals.
The hybrid embryos containing both human and sheep cells were created in an early step toward growing human organs in farm animals before transplanting them into patients, The Financial Times reported.
Using stem cell and genomic editing technologies, human stem cells were successfully transferred into early sheep embryos, producing embryos for which about one in every 100,000 cells were human.
Then the embryos are injected with human stem cells.

However, if within these seven minutes, that message is quoted then the original message will successfully disappear but the deleted text continues to show in the recipient's quote.

Interestingly, there is no mention of how the feature works in cases of quotes in the WhatsApp's FAQ.

This comes following the reports in which researchers claimed to discover other shortcomings in WhatsApp's implementation of deleted messages.

In one particular flaw -- discovered by Spanish tech blog AndroidJefe -- it was possible to recover deleted messages from the Android notification history.

Scientists uncover hidden details in Picasso's painting,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/feb/18/scientists-uncover-hidden-details-in-picassos-painting-1775253.html,"Sunday, February 18, 2018 07:24 PM +0530","WASHINGTON: An international team of scientists has used multiple modes of light to uncover details hidden beneath the visible surface of Spanish painter Pablo Picasso's masterpiece ""La Misereuse accroupie"" or ""The Crouching Woman.""



Researchers released their findings on Saturday's press conference at the ongoing four-day annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science held in Austin, Texas, Xinhua reported.



The 1902 oil painting, owned by Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) in Canada, depicts a crouching and cloaked woman, painted in white, blues, grays and greens.



Researchers used non-invasive portable imaging techniques, including infrared reflectance hyperspectral imaging and then an X-ray fluorescence imaging instrument to detail those buried images.



It shows that Picasso painted over another painter's work after rotating it 90 degrees to the right, using some of the landscape forms in his own final composition. For example, Picasso incorporated the lines of the cliff edges into the woman's back.



Picasso also made a major compositional change, the study showed. The artist initially painted the woman with a right arm and hand holding a disk but then covered them with her cloak in the final work.



Marc Walton, a research professor of materials science and engineering at Northwestern University said, ""Picasso had no qualms about changing things during the painting process.""



The imaging techniques allowed art collectors to better understand Picasso's style, influences and process.



""When we saw the rendering of the lead elemental map, it became clear to me that the arm hidden under the visible surface of 'La Misereuse accroupie' is the same as the proper right arm of a crouching woman in a Picasso watercolour recently sold at auction,"" said Kenneth Brummel, the AGO's assistant curator of modern art. The watercolour is titled ""Femme assise"" (1902).

""Employers must be permitted to 'nip in the bud' the kinds of employee conduct that could lead to a 'hostile workplace,'"" a lawyer with the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) wrote in an agency memorandum made public this week, CNET reported.



Damore's memo, titled ""Google's Ideological Echo Chamber"", claims that when it comes to technology, there is a biological differences between men and women.



Before his firing, Damore had filed a complaint with the NLRB that charged Google with ""misrepresenting and shaming me in order to silence my complaints"".



But the NLRB lawyer said Google fired the computer engineer not for expressing dissenting views or criticism, but over ""unprotected discriminatory statements"" in his memo, which he had posted to internal discussion forums at the tech giant.



""Employers have a strong interest in promoting diversity and encouraging employees across diverse demographic groups to thrive in their workplaces,"" attorney Jayme Sophir wrote in the memorandum.



""The statements regarding biological differences between the sexes were so harmful, discriminatory, and disruptive as to be unprotected,"" Sophir stated.



Damore withdrew the NLRB complaint last month to focus on a lawsuit against Google.



In his lawsuit filed in a California court, Damore said that Google ""ostracised, belittled and punished"" him and a fellow plaintiff.



He added that he and others who share his views at Google long have been ""singled out, mistreated, and systematically punished and terminated from Google, in violation of their legal rights"".



Google CEO Sundar Pichai had said he did not regret firing Damore.



When asked about Google's decision to fire Damore during an interview with MSNBC last month, Pichai said: ""I don't regret it. It was the right decision.

Teenagers use social media posts to appear attractive to friends,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/feb/18/teenagers-use-social-media-posts-to-appear-attractive-to-friends-1775250.html,"Sunday, February 18, 2018 07:07 PM +0530","NEW YORK: Teenagers use social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram to appear attractive and popular among friends, and for that they make a careful selection of photos, activities and links that they share, a new study says.



They work very hard to create a favourable online image, showed the findings published in the Journal of Research on Adolescence.



According to the researchers, content that makes them appear interesting, well-liked and attractive to their friends and peers is a primary goal for adolescents when deciding what to share in digital spaces.



""Teenagers aren't just posting carelessly; they're surprisingly thoughtful about what they choose to reveal on social media,"" said the lead author of the study Joanna Yau from the University of California, Irvine.



""Peer approval is important during adolescence, especially in early adolescence, so they're sharing content that they think others will find impressive,"" Yau added.



Facebook and Instagram provide opportunities for young people to connect and communicate with friends as well as people they know in person but are not necessarily close to, such as classmates.



These social media channels allow individuals time to craft and edit posts and, unlike offline situations, offer teenagers the chance to consider -- even strategise about -- how they want to present themselves online.



The study involved a group of adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18.



The researchers found that for girls, the effort to construct a favourable image can involve lengthy deliberation and advice from confidantes.



The process of posting pictures is particularly time-consuming and can be a joint endeavour among chums -- ensuring that only the most flattering photos, filters and captions are selected. Boys in the study did not ask pals for feedback or to like their posts.



""We found that some teens invested great effort into sharing content on Facebook and Instagram and that what may seem to be an enjoyable activity may actually feel tedious,"" Yau said.

New tech for stroke recovery treatment,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/feb/18/new-tech-for-stroke-recovery-treatment-1775200.html,"Sunday, February 18, 2018 03:47 PM +0530","WASHINGTON D.C: A new stretchable electronics has been found for stroke recovery treatment which has proven to be a game changer.

A groundbreaking new wearable designed to be worn on the throat could have been developed in the field of stroke rehabilitation in the Northwestern University.

The new technology’s sensor is the latest in Professor John A. Rogers' growing portfolio of stretchable electronics that are precise enough for use in advanced medical care and portable enough to be worn outside the hospital, even during extreme exercise.

Rogers' sensors stick directly to the skin, moving with the body and providing detailed health metrics including heart function, muscle activity, and quality of sleep.

""Stretchable electronics allow us to see what is going on inside patients' bodies at a level traditional wearables simply cannot achieve"", Rogers said. ""The key is to make them as integrated as possible with the human body.""

Rogers' new bandage-like throat sensor measured patients' swallowing ability and patterns of speech.

The sensors aid in the diagnosis and treatment of aphasia, a communication disorder associated with stroke.

The tools that speech-language pathologists have traditionally used to monitor patients' speech function - such as microphones - cannot distinguish between patients' voices and ambient noise.

""Our sensors solve that problem by measuring vibrations of the vocal chords"", Rogers said. ""But they only work when worn directly on the throat, which is a very sensitive area of the skin. We developed novel materials for this sensor that bend and stretch with the body, minimizing discomfort to patients"".

Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, a research hospital in Chicago, who collaborated with Rodgers for the research, used the throat sensor in conjunction with electronic biosensors - also developed in Rogers' lab - on the legs, arms and chest to monitor stroke patients' recovery progress.

The intermodal system of sensors streamed data wirelessly to clinicians' phones and computers, providing a quantitative, full-body picture of patients' advanced physical, and physiological responses in real time.

""One of the biggest problems we face with stroke patients is that their gains tend to drop off when they leave the hospital"", said Arun Jayaraman, a research scientist at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. ""With the home monitoring enabled by these sensors, we can intervene at the right time, which could lead to better, faster recoveries for patients"".

Because the sensors are wireless, they eliminated barriers posed by traditional health monitoring devices in clinical settings.

Data from the sensors would be presented in a dashboard that is easy for both clinicians and patients to understand. It would send alerts when patients are underperforming on a certain metric and would allow them to set and track progress toward their goals.

The findings from the study were reported in a symposium at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Annual Meeting in Austin, Texas, USA.","WASHINGTON D.C: A new stretchable electronics has been found for stroke recovery treatment which has proven to be a game changer.

Using this feature, candidates or recruiters can reach each other via InMail to see one's calendar availability and reserve an interview time that works best for both.

It also gives candidates the liberty to feed in their contact information to accelerate this process.

""Our goal is to help you spend less time on the back-and-forth-and a lot more time delighting, advising, and helping candidates make the decision to join your company,"" said Peter Rigano, Senior Product Manager at LinkedIn, in a blogpost late on Tuesday.

""LinkedIn 'Scheduler' is just the latest way that we're working to make recruiters more productive, powerful, and personal,"" Rigano added.

To use the feature, recruiters first need to automatically provide availability via InMail by syncing ""Scheduler"" to Office 365 or Google calendar.

This would automatically set the availability for potential interview times.

Then, using a new ""InMail"" message, recruiters can easily send a scheduling link directly to the candidate of interest.

The link shares a real-time view of the recruiter's calendar availability with candidates who can then choose what time works best for them, add their phone number and confirm the meeting.

Further, advance settings allows recruiters to manage preferences such as time zones, availability, length of meetings and same-day meetings.","The logo for LinkedIn Corporation is shown in Mountain View, California | ReutersSAN FRANCISCO: Professional social network site LinkedIn on Wednesday launched a new tool called ""Scheduler"" that will help ease the hiring process both for recruiters and candidates as well as avoid fallouts.
""LinkedIn Scheduler"" automates initial interview scheduling for recruiters and candidates, directly via InMail.
The new tool would help candidates and recruiters save time spent on scheduling a meeting and help recruiters focus their energies on hiring strategically and onboarding the best candidate, the Microsoft-owned company said in a statement.

Drones monitor wildlife better than humans,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/feb/15/drones-monitor-wildlife-better-than-humans-1773817.html,"Thursday, February 15, 2018 04:57 PM +0530","Accurate monitoring using drones can detect small changes in animal numbers.

CANBERRA (AUSTRALIA): Australian researchers say wildlife is better monitored by drones which can detect small changes important to notice decline in numbers leading to superior conservation of threatened species.

The scientists from University of Adelaide employed thousands of rubber ducks to prove that drones are more accurate than humans, Xinhua news agency reported.

Experienced wildlife spotters were pitted against spotters who counted birds from drone imagery to see which group would get closest to the actual number of fake birds.

Ground spotters counted the birds using binoculars or telescopes while a drone was flown over the beach, taking pictures from different heights and angles.

""We found it is more accurate and more precise to have people count birds from the drone imagery than to do it on location,"" lead author Jarrod Hodgson said.

The results showed that monitoring animals with drones produced better data that could be used to proactively manage wildlife.

Hodgson and his team developed a computer algorithm capable of counting birds from the drone images, yielding results on par with humans counting from the images.

""With so many animals across the world facing extinction, our need for accurate wildlife data has never been greater,"" Hodgson said.

""Accurate monitoring can detect small changes in animal numbers. That is important because if we had to wait for a big shift in those numbers to notice the decline, it might be too late to conserve a threatened species.

""For a few years now, drones have been used to monitor different animals that can be seen from above, including elephants, seals and nesting birds.

""But, until now, the accuracy of using drones to count wildlife was unclear,"" Hodgson said.

""We needed to test the technology where we knew the correct answer. We couldn't use wild animals because we could never be sure of the real number of individuals present.""","Accurate monitoring using drones can detect small changes in animal numbers.

NEW DELHI: Owing to falling 4G data prices, a significant 40 percent of Indians prefer to watch advertisement videos on their mobile phones over other media, finds a survey.

The survey, by mobile advertisement technology and data analytics company MoMagic Technologies, showed that most of the mobile advertisements were viewed while playing games and watching videos on platforms such as Youtube.

Over 28 per cent of the respondents watches mobile ads for winning credits in games, followed by ads while shopping online at 25.5 percent.

""What we are witnessing is an increasing migration of video consumption including video ads by users in Tier I and II cities because of economical 4G data plans in a highly competitive mobile operators market which is pushing costs and inversely offering higher data limit packages,"" Arun Gupta, CEO and Founder, MoMagic Technologies said in a statement.

The survey also showed that 37 per cent of the people view their mobile phones over six times in an hour due to high level of addiction fuelled by interrelated activities such as social media and online videos, etc.

This has led to rapid consumption of mobile ads as 56 percent of the respondents see these ads at least two to three times a day.

This is already leading to an over 60 percent digital ad spend that comes from a mobile platform, the survey said.

In 2017, mobile ad spends increased at a rapid pace in India as it grew at a staggering rate of over 80 percent.

Image-based text ads were found to be at 24 percent, while text messages were at 11 percent.

Oppo A83: A selfie lovers' device for general usage,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2018/feb/15/oppo-a83-a-selfie-lovers-device-for-general-usage-1773702.html,"Thursday, February 15, 2018 12:04 PM +0530","NEW DELHI: Aiming to put up a fight in the crowded mid-segment smartphone market, Chinese smartphone player OPPO has launched its ""A83"" that claims to have a better camera and enhanced battery life.

The Rs 13,990 device is in direct competition with the recently-launched Honor 9 Lite (Rs 14,999 for 4GB+64GB) and Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime (Rs 12,990).

However, being a camera-centric device, it also competes with Xiaomi Mi A1 and Moto G5S Plus (both present in the sub-Rs 15,000 segment).

A83 emulates the iPhone X when it comes to unlocking the device and skips the fingerprint scanner.

Let's see what works for the device.

OPPO is traditionally known for its camera and the A83 comes with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled beauty and face unlock features.

The smartphone has a plastic back, with the camera placed in a similar fashion as in iPhone 8, which looks good with a decent finish.

The unibody-styled device comes with 3GB RAM and runs MediaTek MT6763T processor.

With a 5.7-inch HD+ screen, a resolution of 720×1440 pixels and an aspect ratio of 18:9, the A83 delivered day-long back-up with its 3,180mAh battery on routine usage.

The device's performance was decent enough while performing day-to-day tasks.

The OPPO A83 runs on Android 7.1, with the a custom user interface Color OS 3.2. It has a couple of bloatware apps that can be uninstalled.

OPPO has tried to make the device look futuristic by not including the fingerprint scanner and opted for the ""Face Unlock"" feature instead. The feature worked fine most of the times -- unlocking the device in a little less than a second.

The ""AI beauty"" tool in the 8MP selfie shooter was quite impressive. We could adjust the amount of ""beauty"" we needed in images. It covered all the marks and spots on the face and brightened it to the maximum.

The ""Bokeh"" effect was good, but you need well-lit conditions to get an excellent picture outcome.

The 13MP rear camera with single-tone LED flash and an aperture of f/2.2 could record videos in Full-HD resolution.

In daylight conditions, pictures came out really well, but the photos shot in dull conditions were grainy.

What doesn't work?

The ""Face Unlock"" feature is the next big innovation in smartphones, but in dark conditions, A83 users may have to opt for the basic passlock as the feature is not very responsive.

Although the device is ahead of the curve compared to its competitors when it comes to features like ""AI beauty"" and 18:9 aspect ratio, it still lacks the power to convince users with the quality of photos in dull conditions.

Conclusion: OPPO A83 is a good choice if you want a device with next-generation innovation in camera, display and general usage. Expecting a good performance while undertaking heavy tasks will disappoint you.","A83 emulates the iPhone X when it comes to unlocking the device and skips the fingerprint scanner.

PARIS: Google launched its own ""stories"" format Tuesday to compete with Snapchat and Instagram with image-driven news articles aimed at mobile phone and tablet users.

Content for its ""AMP stories"" initially comes from outlets like CNN, The Washington Post, Conde Nast, Wired and US People magazine, and is designed to load much faster on mobile devices than conventional articles and videos.

""On mobile devices, users browse lots of articles, but engage with few in-depth,"" said Rudy Galfi, who is heading the drive at Google.

""Images, videos and graphics help get readers' attention as quickly as possible and keep them engaged through immersive and easily consumable visual information,"" he added.

""AMP stories"" articles fill the screen and are image and video led. Users can tap on the home screen to read further or simply swipe to the next article.

Google claims the format, which it is opening up to software developers, gives ""novel ways to tell immersive stories"" without the ""prohibitively high start-up costs, particularly for small publishers"".

It was developed with major US media outlets and can also be read on a computer, although its promoters said the immersive effect is better on mobiles.

According to a research project led by the University at Buffalo, New York, and Institute of Semiconductors (IoP) at the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS), the tab -- a triboelectric nanogenerator -- can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy for electronic devices.



""The human body is an abundant source of energy. We thought: 'Why not harness it to produce our own power?'"" said lead author Qiaoqiang Gan, associate professor at the University at Buffalo.



The tab was detailed in the journal Nano Energy.



Triboelectric charging occurs when certain materials become electrically charged after coming into contact with a different material. Most everyday static electricity is triboelectric.



The tab consists of two thin layers of gold, with polydimethylsiloxane (also called PDMS -- a silicon-based polymer used in contact lenses, Silly Putty and other products) sandwiched in between.



One layer of gold is stretched, causing it to crumple upon release and create what looks like a miniature mountain range. When that force is reapplied, for example, from a finger bending, the motion leads to friction between the gold layers and PDMS.



""This causes electrons to flow back and forth between the gold layers. The more friction, the greater the amount of power is produced,"" said Yun Xu, professor at the IoP.



The study described a small tab (1.5 centimetres long, by one centimetre wide).



It delivered a maximum voltage of 124 volts, a maximum current of 10 microamps and a maximum power density of 0.22 milliwatts per square centimetre.



That is not enough to quickly charge a smartphone, but it lit 48 red LED lights simultaneously.



The team is planning to use larger pieces of gold, which when stretched and folded together are expected to deliver even more electricity.



The researchers are also working on developing a portable battery to store energy produced by the tab.



They envision the system serving as a power source for various wearable and self-powered electronic devices.

The joint report by DQ Institute and the World Economic Forum, over 50 per cent of 8-12 year olds are susceptible to cyber-bullying, video game addiction, offline meetings, disinformation and online sexual grooming.

Notably, the problem is more acute in emerging economies, where ""internet adoption has been more rapid and less subject to appropriate safeguards by parents, industry or government"".

The purpose of the '2018 DQ Impact Report' is to highlight the need for concerted action by government, industry and civil society to help parents counter the threats facing the youngest 'digital citizens' and ""such a need is more acute in emerging economies"", it said.

""We must act quickly and take positive steps to help these children facing cyber-risks around the world, especially in information and communication technology (ICT)-emerging countries. We need to work together to help our children outsmart cyber-risks and become successful and responsible digital citizens who maximise their potential and minimise cyber-risks,"" said Yuhyun Park, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the DQ Institute, Singapore.

The study of 38,000 children noted that 47 per cent have been victimised through cyber-bullying in the past year.

""Today's youth make up an important part of our informed society, they will be tomorrow's voters and our future leaders. Ensuring they are better equipped to face the challenges of hyper-connected life, earlier on, should be a societal priority,"" said Cheryl Martin, MD, Head of Industries and Member of the Managing Board at the WEF.

Moreover, the children spend an average of 32 hours per week in front of digital screens for entertainment alone – longer than the time they spend in school, the study said.

There is a positive association between screen time and exposure to cyber-bullying, video game addiction, offline meetings and online sexual behaviours, it said.","NEW DELHI: Majority of kids in the age bracket of 8-12 are subjected to online threats like cyberbullying and video game addiction, and the situation is ""acute"" in emerging economies, says a survey.

How Is It Made?

This in-house specialty is almost like a normal samosa; however, it is made with filo pastry. This multi-layered delight has a total of 60 layers, 30 on each side, and is stuffed with a filling of potatoes, peas and mild spices. These spices tend to seep through the crispy layers, making it taste even more delicious. This puff-pastry has a flaky casing, which resembles patties to a great extent. Japani samosa is served with piping hot chickpea curry and sweet yellow chutney. The chutney is prepared using bottle gourd and mango. What makes Japani samosa different from the others is its flaky texture, which keeps it crispy for a much longer time.

Japani samosa is an interesting combination of Indian and Japanese culinary fare. It is a welcome variation amidst those regular tea-time snacks like regular samosas and bread pakoras. Pair it with a cup of hot tea or coffee, and you're done for the day. When it comes to the texture of the same, the layers are extremely fine and crisp. One plate of this culinary delight is enough to satiate your hunger. What works the best for this samosa is its potato filling, which is mild and well-complemented with chickpea curry. If you're a spice junkie, who loves to gorge on spicy stuff, then this chickpea curry is apt for you.

Now, that you know about this quirky samosa, head to this dhaba and give it a try! Don't forget to pair it with the ever-so-delicious chickpea curry!","Japani samosa is one delight that can only be found in Chandni Chowk.

Actor par excellence, Rani Mukerji is ringing in her 40th birthday today. The actor is all set to make a comeback on silver screen with Hichki, which will hit the screens this Friday, 23rd March 2018. Rani would be seen essaying the role of a teacher who is suffering from Tourette syndrome - a common neuropsychiatric disorder characterised by repetitive movements or unwanted sounds.

In an illustrious career spanning 22 years, Rani has won several accolades for her path-breaking performances. In the year 2004, Rani became the first and only actress to win both the Filmfare Award for 'Best Actress' (Bunty aur Babli) and 'Best Supporting Actress' (Yuva) in the same year. The following year, she set a milestone again by winning the Filmfare Award for 'Best Actor Critics' and Filmfare award for 'Best Actress,' for her performance in the movie Black.'

Rani, who is thoroughly enjoying her motherhood, revealed in an interview that motherhood has transformed her completely. She recently hosted a cute birthday bash for her daughter, Adira Chopra, which was attended by many stars and their star babies including Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi and Karan Johar's twins, Yash and Roohi Johar.

In her long spanning career, Rani has charmed the audience with both her fit and fab avatar as well her chubby girl-next door roles. Her strenuous and intense workout for the movie Dil Bole Hadippa and Mardani grabbed quite a few headlines, but she has maintained that her household is essentially a foodie one. Both husband Aditya Chopra and Rani are fond of good food from various cuisines.

Here are some food and fitness secrets of Rani you may not have known.

Rani Mukerji does not believe in crash dieting. Even while she was preparing for her role of a tough cop in Mardaani, she was on a special diet, but was not starving herself. She would eat at small intervals of every 4 hours. Her breakfast would include protein filled dishes, and dinner with soups, salads and grilled veggies. Her mid-meal snack would be fruits, and salads. She also kept herself hydrated throughout the day with various beverages like coconut water and lemon water.

Being a true-blue Bengali, Rani loves her Bengali meal. In fact, a leading news daily also reported that Rani chose to go for a traditional Bengali Godh bharai, instead of western baby shower. In Shaad-Bhakkan (Bengali baby shower), mothers-to be are pampered with a thali full of their favourite food. The mother-to be is expected to finish her entire plate, without leaving a single grain on her plate in the end.

During Rani's occasional Durga Puja Pandal outings, she assumes the role of serving bhog to the onlookers and guests. She enjoys a plateful of khichdi, begun bhaaja (baingan), tamatar chutney and payesh (kheer) herself with her family, which makes for a great photo-opportunity for the media each year.

"Zone Diet: This Weight Loss Diet Claims To Reduce Inflammation And Promote Fat Burn, But Does It Work?",https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/zone-diet-this-weight-loss-diet-promises-to-reduce-inflammation-and-promote-fat-burn-but-does-it-wor-1826389,"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 18:53:41 +0530","Highlights The Zone Diet was designed by biochemist Barry Sears.

The diet recommends eating three meals and two snacks.

The diet restricts calorie intake and limits it to 1,200 to 1,500 per day

weight loss diets is a very confusing one. There are countless 'scientifically-devised' meal plans and nutrition plans out there, which promise to get you just a little bit closer to your body goals. If you're someone who has been trying to lose weight for a while now, you may know how utterly baffling it can be to figure out which diet plan works and which doesn't. But, the most important point to remember is that any diet plan you follow, it must aid weight loss in a healthy manner, without depriving your body of essential nutrients.

There is one particular diet that promises to reduce inflammation in the body by making you eat all the essential nutrients. The Zone Diet recommends that you eat five times day, so as to prevent 'overeating,' which often happens when you only eat three meals per day. The zone diet is a low carb diet and was designed by a biochemist, Barry Sears. He has published dozens of books on the diet, making it gain traction worldwide. So, what is the Zone Diet?

What Is The 'Zone Diet'?

The official website of Sears' Zone Diet describes 'zone' as a ""real physiological state in your body that can be measured in clinical tests."" It further adds, ""If you are in the Zone, you have optimised your ability to control diet-induced inflammation."" The website also defines three 'clinical markers' that indicate whether you're in the zone or not. These markers include: Triglyceride to High Density lipoproteins, or HDL, cholesterol ratio, AA to EPA ratio, which defines the presence of the two essential fatty acids in blood, and finally, percentage of glycated haemoglobin, or HbA1c.

Sears has given a value to all three markers, and he theorises that if these three values are met, then your body is in the 'Zone'. He has also listed the alleged benefits of the Zone Diet as loss of excess body fat, better performance, increased thinking capabilities, as well as slowed process of ageing. To reap the benefits of this diet, Sears recommends that one balance every meal with one-third protein, two-thirds vegetable and fruit carbs, and a dash of fat.

What Can You Eat In The 'Zone Diet'?

There aren't many foods that are off-limits in the zone diet, except foods like pastas and breads, as well as fruits that are high in sugar. People who follow the diet generally eat three meals and two snacks per day. The main foods include sources of lean proteins like salmon, carbohydrates from vegetables, and small amounts of good fat from olive oil, walnuts, avocados, etc. Zone diet evangelists believe that the diet restricts their calorie intake to 1,200 to 1,500 per day.



Also Read: The Alkaline Diet: Does it Really Work for Weight Loss?

Does Zone Diet Work?

There's no sound research or scientific evidence, or any peer-reviewed study that proves that the zone diet improves metabolism or quickens fat burn. The only thing that works in its favour is that it restricts calorie-intake while promoting satiety, both of which are indicators of a good weight loss diet. But, then again, any diet that restricts calorie intake may result in weight loss.

It's always advisable to consult your physician before following any 'fad diet.'","The zone diet is a low carb diet and was designed by a biochemist, Barry Sears.

Although, the bright purple veggie is technically a fruit and a close relative of tomato , but is used as a vegetable and is extremely beneficial for your health. Besides being extremely rich in dietary fibre (and hence, promoting diet suppression and weight loss ), aubergines also have vitamins B1, vitamin B6 and potassium. They contain a potent antioxidant called nasunin, which also helps in moving excess iron out of the body. What's more? They're extremely versatile too!This is one of the easiest and most yummy ways to enjoy aubergines. All you have to do is cut the veggie length-wise, scoop out the flesh and fry it with onions and tomatoes. Add seasonings of your choice to the cooked aubergine flesh and set it back in the shell. Bake the stuffed shells and voila! Your stuffed aubergine is ready.(Also Read: 5 Amazing Health Benefits of Eggplant You May Have Not Heard Before Another amazingly easy way to enjoy brinjal is to make a dip out of it.

This dip can be enjoyed with cucumber sticks, sweet potato fries or salad leaves, the choice is yours!One of the best ways to load up on all the dietary fibre of the brinjal is to cut rounds of it and bake them.

Be it through her power-packed performances, umpteen awards and accolades, or her bold statements - Kanagana is always making headlines. Kangana's strong fashion sense and beautiful physique are a recurrent talking point too in the media. Here are some food and fitness secrets of the actor you may not have known.

Kangana's Diet Secrets

Kangana starts off the day with a power-packed breakfast. A bowl of porridge, cereals and fresh fruits are a regular feature on her breakfast spread. It is said that she is very fond of coffee, which she can have at any point in the day. Her lunch is a simple bowl of lentils, rice or chapatti. In between her meals, she keeps herself fuelled with a bowl of fresh fruits or a thick protein shake. She prefers her dinner to be light and carb-free like a nice hot bowl of soup or some grilled vegetables.

Kangana who has recently turned vegetarian is loving the change it has brought in her health and lifestyle. Kangana, who used to love her biryanis and goshts, doesn't repent the decision that she has taken, even for a bit! She even used to cook delicious seafood and meat curries herself. But now, the actress is happy putting together herself a vegetable salad, pulav, sandwich or a pasta. Since her favourite cuisine is Indian and Italian, she picks many herbs and spices from around the world to make her veggies healthy and enticing.

While Kangana loves to eat out and explore new restaurants, nothing takes the place for simple ghar ka khana for her. Simple dal, chawal and sabzi is Kangana's all-time favourite.

Kangana's Fitness Secrets

Kangana has always managed to maintain her figure and she credits it to yoga. In an interview in NDTV's Glamour Show, she gave all the credit to her yoga instructor for her fabulously toned body. She also claimed that yoga transformed her life altogether. She said, ""Yoga helped me to achieve this kind of focus and concentration. Initially, my mind was bombarded with thoughts, which were directionless. However, with yoga, I found purpose and focus, which helped me to attain stability.""

Not many of you would know that Kangana is an ectomorph. Her fitness trainer revealed that it is difficult for the actress to gain weight, which is why she is always on the leaner side.

A post shared by Kangana Ranaut (@team_kangana_ranaut) on Mar 2, 2018 at 9:23pm PST

For Kangana, fitness is paramount. Her physique and shape is mainly dependent upon the movie that she is engaged with. If the character demands her to slim down, she would hit the gym and make sure she looks the part, and if the character does not require any major physical transformation, Kangana sticks to her regular fitness regimen.

The jaggery in the chikki gives you a sweet kick, without harming your health like processed sugar does.

Made from coconut milk, chana dal, jaggery or gur and cardamom, the chana dal payasam is also packed with a lot of nutrients. It's a great festive alternative for milk payasam that is a regular feature in dessert menus on many Indian festivals.

"New Overwatch Patch Brings Brigitte, Fixes UI, and More",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/new-overwatch-patch-brings-brigitte-fixes-ui-and-more-1826964,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 21:35:18 +0530","Blizzard's hero shooter Overwatch finally gets its newest hero Brigitte by way of a new patch for the game. Previously restricted to those in Overwatch PTR (public test region), she's now playable for all on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Brigitte's entry to Overwatch follows Moira, Doomfist, Orisa, Sombra, and Ana. She is a support class character and the 27th addition to the game's ever-growing roster of heroes. She wields a hammer and a shield. According to Overwatch lore she is the daughter of Torbjorn and is the squire of Reinhardt. Both are popular Overwatch heroes focussing on defence and tank roles respectively.

However Brigitte isn't the only new addition to Overwatch. The new Overwatch patch brings character-specific tweaks such as Sombra's Hack ability getting a two second cool down when interrupted and fixing Doomfist's Rocket Punch issues. The UI for Overwatch has got some subtle tweaks too. These include squashing a bug that prevented users from restoring default settings in the game menu and another that deleted descriptions in the Overwatch Save Highlight text box.

Overwatch Patch Notes – March 20

General

Changed the name of Junkrat’s Scarecrow spray to Hayseed

Developer Comments: We’re also removing the 0.1 second window of time during a hack where it couldn’t be canceled via line of sight or with other abilities including Tracer’s Recall and Zarya’s Particle Barrier, which was originally put in place so the hack wouldn’t be interrupted by small objects such as light posts. We’ve implemented a separate fix for that issue, so she should still be unaffected by those small objects.

Epic Games Explains Why Fortnite Doesn’t Have Friendly Fire,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fortnite-friendly-fire-player-toxicity-ios-ps4-pc-xbox-one-1826947,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 20:29:35 +0530","Popular shooter Fortnite removed friendly fire. This feature allows users to shoot their own team mates. While present in the game initially, it was removed to combat in-game toxicity Fortnite developer Epic Games said. Fortnite is currently playable on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and iOS with an Android version of the game in the works, friendly fire is a massive component for most shooters. Many Fortnite players claim that they were being killed by their teammates for their gear or simply to troll.

“People were saying, ‘People are killing me for my stuff’ or ‘People are killing me just to troll’ or whatever it might be, but we also understood that it was an important part of the genre up to that point,” said Ben Lewis-Evans, User Experience Lead Researcher at Epic Games to Polygon. “We had a different type of game with more explosive weapons, with faster action that had come before as well. The original decision to turn it off was just an experiment. ‘Let’s turn this off, see if it is negative.’”

Fortnite Battle Royale on iOS: As Good as PS4, Xbox One, and PC?

The Fortnite team at Epic Games believed that if the overall community response to removing friendly fire was negative, it would bring it back. But if fans were fine with the move, it would be pulled from the game completely.

“We had theories about what could be impacted by [turning friendly fire] on and off, but you can look at things like, ‘Did people play more field games? ‘Were they playing more with friends? ‘Was the number of accidental deaths going up or down?,’” Lewis-Evans said. “How do you tell what’s a general team kill? Another problem with team killing is that the player thinks it’s genuine, but it’s accidental. It doesn’t matter if they were, though, because the emotional impact still carries.

“If you think someone did something on purpose, it doesn’t matter if it was accidental. It affects your experience.”

With an ever-increasing player base thanks to Fortnite iOS, other issues have cropped up such as server outages. How Epic manages these concerns in the weeks to come will be interesting to see. Are you playing Fortnite? What do you think of the game? Let us know in the comments.

Privacy Issues Emerge as Major Business Risk for Facebook,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/privacy-issues-emerge-as-major-business-risk-for-facebook-1826940,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 20:02:00 +0530","Facebook faces substantial business risks from new European Union privacy rules set to take effect in May, a looming reality that came into stark relief over the weekend with revelations that a controversial political consulting firm had improperly obtained personal data on 50 million Facebook users.

Privacy experts said the disclosure that a researcher had sold Facebook data collected via a personality quiz to the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica is a prime example of the kinds of practices that the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is supposed to prevent or punish.

The danger faced by Facebook going forward is two-fold: Complying with the rules means letting European users opt out of the highly targeted online ads that have made Facebook a money machine. Violating GDPR mandates could subject the California company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues.

Facebook-Cambridge Analytica Scandal Explained in 10 Simple Points

Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on May 25, it ""would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue"", said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems. Because a UK company was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, GDPR would have applied.

Shares in Facebook fell on Monday by 7 percent, their biggest drop since 2014, wiping nearly $40 billion off the value of the firm founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg.

Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users. Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015.

Schrems has founded a non-profit, called None Of Your Business (NOYB), that is hiring lawyers and exploring avenues for ""strategic litigation"" over GDPR privacy violations.

According to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who formerly worked with Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm used the data to help then-US presidential candidate Donald Trump to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.

""The fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn't adequately monitoring what third-parties were doing,"" said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild.

Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices.

Facebook said it changed its policies in 2014 to ""to give much less data, especially about friends,"" Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth said in a Facebook post on Monday.

""We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,"" the company said on Monday. ""We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.""

Compliance with GDPR rules could cost Facebook a significant amount of money. Deutsche Bank analysts in January estimated that Facebook's overall revenue could be lowered by 4 percent in a scenario in which 30 percent of EU users opt out of targeted ads, reducing the effectiveness and likely price of ads shown by 50 percent.

The EU represents 24 percent of Facebook's ad revenue, so multiplying those figures, the bank said the regulations could have a 4 percent impact on overall Facebook revenue.

""If this regulatory approach spreads to other countries or if GDPR ever becomes more onerous over the medium or long term, it would pose more risk,"" Deutsche Bank warned.

The firestorm over Cambridge Analytica has prompted a furious response from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, raising the prospect of just such an expansion of privacy protections.

Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser reiterated his 'sell' rating on Facebook after the weekend reports. Wieser expressed concerns that the company's regulatory risks would intensify and that its sophisticated use of data in advertising was in jeopardy.

A December 2017 survey found that only 21 percent of European consumers know what GDPR is. But after the regulation was explained, 82 percent of respondents said they plan to exercise their new rights, according to the survey of 7,000 Europeans conducted by Cambridge, Mass.-based Pegasystems, which makes sales and marketing software.

PageFair, an Irish startup that helps website deliver non-targeted ads and avoid ad-blocking, estimates that only 3 percent of European social media users will opt-in to targeted ads, a potentially ""devastating"" blow for Facebook and other platforms, says Johnny Ryan, PageFair's head of ecosystem.

Giving consumers control

The quandary for Facebook is readily apparent from a video it began showing customers in February: it teaches people how to delete their accounts.

GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies. Social networks will also need to regain Europeans' consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising.

Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.

""There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,"" she told Reuters.

Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next.

For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face.

The company did not make those features available in Europe. Facebook did not specify a reason. But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor.

Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions. The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented ""in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.""

In other words, the days of extensive ""terms of service"" agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, numerous data privacy lawyers told Reuters.

In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more ""permissions screens"" and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature.

That could depress usage, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said at an investor conference last month. ""Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there's some potential that people decide they're not going to use the product,"" Wehner said. ""We don't think it will be big, but there could be some implication there.""

Cambridge Analytica Scandal Threatens Mark Zuckerberg's Vision for Facebook,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/cambridge-analytica-scandal-threatens-mark-zuckerbergs-vision-for-facebook-1826939,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 20:00:02 +0530","First it was ""move fast and break things."" Then it was ""connecting the world"" and ""building a global community.""

Mark Zuckerberg's ambitious vision for Facebook spawned one of the world's most powerful companies, but he now faces a moment of reckoning as it becomes clear the social network has been hijacked and manipulated for very different ends.

Snowballing revelations on the misuse of the Facebook platform to spread disinformation, and to harvest personal data in ways users had never imagined, risks undermining the very business model underpinning the social media giant.

Facebook-Cambridge Analytica Scandal Explained in 10 Simple Points

Zuckerberg took an idea hatched in his Harvard dormitory and created a network connecting more than two billion people, crushing competing social networks while imagining new ways to connect friends to each other -- and for marketers to reach users.

The rise of social media fuelled a wave of optimism about empowering ordinary people, notably following the Arab Spring uprisings starting in 2010.

""I had the feeling in 2011 that digital technologies were inherently democratic and would fuel democratic revolutions around the globe,"" said Dannagal Young, a University of Delaware professor who studies social media.

Young said these networks did indeed help propel the Arab Spring, as well as social movements like Black Lives Matter or #MeToo -- but that the public had failed to grasp their darker side.

""People use these platforms and do not understand the economic model,"" Young said. ""They don't understand what is being commodified, as is everything they do and everything they share.""

Eliminating gatekeepers

While social networks appear to empower individuals by doing away with ""gatekeepers"" -- such as the traditional mass media, or political authorities -- the selling of user data can have the opposite effect.

""If the business model is predicated on selling user data, it can seem as democratic as you want but it's serving a surveillance function that undermines democratic values,"" Young said.

Facebook's reputation has been tarnished ever since 2016, following disclosures of Russian-led efforts to influence the US election -- notably by spreading ""fake news"" and other forms of disinformation on social media.

But things got markedly worse following weekend revelations that data on 50 million users was culled by a British-based political firm working on Donald Trump's presidential campaign, prompting calls for investigations on both sides of the Atlantic.

Zuckerberg, who began touring the United States after the presidential election, sparking speculation he might run for top office, last year offered his vision of a ""global community"" as more people become disillusioned with troubled political institutions.

""The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do,"" the 33-year-old wrote.

But first of all, Zuckerberg will need to focus on the more immediate mission he set himself earlier this year: to ""fix"" his embattled social network.

'Polluted by bad actors'

Roger Kay, a technology analyst and consultant for Endpoint Technologies Associates, noted that Facebook is just one of many online firms that make use of detailed digital records on its users' activities, which can rarely be expunged.

""Facebook adds to this, but it's not the cause of the problem,"" Kay said. ""The problem is your long-term digital footprint.""

Young, of the University of Delaware, voiced optimism that users can regain better control over their Facebook data -- as more people learn about online privacy and how to determine what is shared about them.

""We as users have a lot more control than we think,"" she said. ""If enough users go in and change their settings, Facebook will be forced to respond. I do think there is a fix but it requires a whole lot of learning.""

Then comes the issue of disinformation -- which Facebook has been under mounting pressure to combat.

Emily Vraga, a George Mason University professor of communication, said Facebook has taken positive steps in ferreting out false information in recent months.

""But I would like to see even more of that,"" she said.

One way, she said, would be making Facebook's algorithm available.

""I do think the public should be more aware"" of how the network operates, she said.

For Young, both Facebook and Zuckerberg appear to have assumed that ""when you crowdsource things the truth will come out"" -- a belief that appears naive in light of the ""fake news"" phenomenon.

""It could be that 98 percent of people on Facebook do it in good faith,"" she said, but ""it doesn't take a lot to undermine that system.""

Kay also voiced doubt over Facebook's ultimate ability to eliminate all malicious content without examining every item on its platform -- an impossible task.

""They can't curate something with two billion users, there aren't enough editors out there,"" he said. ""And if they held up the content, the users would go away.""

He also notes that Facebook is not the first digital firm to be manipulated in such a way.""Social networks have come and gone,"" Kay said. ""They are first seen as an amazing way to connect people and then they become polluted by bad actors.""","""The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do,"" the 33-year-old wrote.

Cambridge Analytica Suspends CEO Over Facebook Scandal,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/cambridge-analytica-suspends-ceo-over-facebook-scandal-1826936,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 19:47:30 +0530","Facebook expressed outrage Tuesday over the misuse of its data as Cambridge Analytica, the British firm at the centre of a major scandal rocking the social media giant, suspended its chief executive.

The move to suspend CEO Alexander Nix came as recordings emerged in which he boasts his data company played an expansive role in Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, doing all of its research, analytics as well as digital and television campaigns.

In undercover filming captured by Britain's Channel 4 News, he is also seen boasting about entrapping politicians and secretly operating in elections around the world through shadowy front companies.

Lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic have demanded answers after it was revealed at the weekend that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from 50 million Facebook users.

Facebook-Cambridge Analytica Scandal Explained in 10 Simple Points

Cambridge Analytica has denied using Facebook data for the Trump campaign, but the scandal has ratcheted up the pressure on the social media giant -- already under fire for allowing fake news to proliferate on its platform during the US campaign.

On Tuesday Facebook said its top executives were ""working around the clock to get all the facts.""

""The entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,"" the firm said.

Cambridge Analytica's board said meanwhile that Nix would stand aside immediately pending an investigation into the snowballing allegations against him.

""In the view of the Board, Mr. Nix's recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,"" the company said.

In Channel 4's recordings, Nix slights US representatives on the House Intelligence Committee to whom he gave evidence last year, claiming its Democrats are motivated by ""sour grapes"" and Republicans asked few questions.

""They're politicians, they're not technical. They don't understand how it works,"" he was caught on camera telling an undercover reporter.

He also outlines the use of a secret self-destructing email system.

""There's no evidence, there's no paper trail, there's nothing,"" he said of the tool, which deletes emails two hours after they have been read.

Investigations multiply

Channel 4 News broadcast an interview filmed in October last year with defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, in which she said she had faced ""a massive propaganda effort.""

""There was a new kind of campaign that was being run on the other side,"" she said. ""It affected the thought processes of voters.""

Facebook now faces investigations on both sides of the Atlantic, sending its share price tumbling another 2.6 percent after a 6.8 percent plunge Monday.

European Union officials have called for an urgent investigation while British lawmakers have asked Zuckerberg to give evidence to a UK parliamentary committee.

Zuckerberg has been asked to appear before the European Parliament.

""Facebook needs to clarify before the representatives of 500 million Europeans that personal data is not being used to manipulate democracy,"" tweeted parliament president Antonio Tajani.

US lawmakers have also called on Zuckerberg to appear before Congress, along with the chief executives of Twitter and Google.

Officials in the US states of Massachusetts and New York announced they were sending a ""demand letter"" to Facebook for the facts of the case.

""Consumers have a right to know how their information is used -- and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users' personal information,"" New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.

Thirteen US consumer and privacy organisations meanwhile released a letter to the Federal Trade Commission asking it to reopen a probe into Facebook, saying the firm's admission so far ""suggests a clear violation"" of a 2011 consent decree.

Watchdog searches

A former Cambridge Analytica employee says it was able to create psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users through the use of a personality prediction app that was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up data from friends -- as was possible under Facebook's rules at the time.

The end goal was to create software to predict and influence voters' choices at the ballot box.

The company blames the academic who developed the app, University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, for misusing the data, which it says was never used on the Trump campaign, and has in any event been deleted.

But the firm's reputation took a severe hit on Monday, with the broadcast of a first batch of secret footage showing Nix saying it could entrap politicians in compromising situations with bribes and sex workers.

He also said the firm secretly campaigns in elections around the world, including by operating through a web of shadowy front companies, or by using sub-contractors, according to Channel 4 News.

A Cambridge Analytica spokesman told the news programme it does not use ""untrue material for any purpose"".

Facebook, which says the data was taken without its knowledge, has launched its own investigation into Cambridge Analytica.

But it was forced to suspend its probe following a request from Britain's information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who is making her own inquiries into both companies.

Denham's office said it had yet to obtain a court warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's servers, and was now expecting to secure it on Wednesday.","Facebook expressed outrage Tuesday over the misuse of its data as Cambridge Analytica, the British firm at the centre of a major scandal rocking the social media giant, suspended its chief executive.

The Uber had a forward-facing video recorder, which showed the woman was walking a bike at about 10pm and moved into traffic from a dark centre median. ""It's very clear it would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode,"" Sylvia Moir, police chief in Tempe, Arizona, told the San Francisco Chronicle.

""The driver said it was like a flash, the person walked out in front of them,"" Moir said, referring to the backup driver who was behind the wheel but not operating the vehicle. ""His first alert to the collision was the sound of the collision.""

The chief's account raises new questions in the investigation that holds importance to the future of the burgeoning autonomous vehicle industry. Uber Technologies halted autonomous vehicle tests in the wake of the accident.

It's too soon to draw any conclusions from the preliminary information that has emerged, said Brian Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who has studied autonomous vehicle liability.

""It's possible that Uber's automated driving system did not detect the pedestrian, did not classify her as a pedestrian, or did not predict her departure from the median,"" Smith said in an email. ""I don't know whether these steps occurred too late to prevent or lessen the collision or whether they never occurred at all, but the lack of braking or swerving whatsoever is alarming and suggests that the system never anticipated the collision.""

Police later said in a statement that the department would defer to county prosecutors on whether to bring charges, but didn't dispute any of the information released by Moir.

In a news conference Monday, Tempe Police Sgt. Roland Elcock said local authorities had not come to any conclusions about who is at fault. Decisions on any possible charges will be made by the Maricopa County Attorney's office. Neither the victim nor the backup driver showed any signs of impairment.

The victim, Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bike outside of the crosswalk. The car was most likely going about 38 miles (61 kilometres) per hour, Moir said. Nearby signs show the speed limit was either 35 or 40 mph, though the 40 mph sign was closest to the accident site.

The department expects to give a further update later Tuesday but has no plans to release video footage while the investigation is underway.

Sensors on self-driving cars - which may include laser-based technology, radar and video - are designed to sense pedestrians and other obstructions even in the dark.

The National Transportation Safety Board is opening an investigation into the death and is sending a team of four investigators to Tempe, about 10 miles east of Phoenix. The Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dispatched a special crash investigation team.

The NTSB opens relatively few highway accident probes each year, but has been closely following incidents involving autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles. Last year, it partially faulted Tesla's Autopilot system for a fatal crash in Florida in 2016.

Fatal US Self-Driving Auto Accident Raises Novel Legal Questions,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/transportation/news/fatal-us-self-driving-auto-accident-raises-novel-legal-questions-1826930,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 19:31:01 +0530","The death of a pedestrian hit by a self-driving Uber vehicle in Arizona this week could offer a test of who can be held legally responsible for accidents when a human is no longer at the wheel, legal experts said.

Any litigation that arises from the accident, the first fatality involving a fully autonomous vehicle, could pit the ride-hailing service against technology suppliers and the vehicle's manufacturer, legal experts said. It could also provide a window into confidential indemnification agreements that companies developing self-driving car systems may have reached to shield themselves legally.

In Sunday's accident, Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bicycle outside the crosswalk on a four-lane road in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe when she was hit by the Volvo XC90 SUV, which was travelling in autonomous mode at about 40 miles per hour, police said.

Tempe Police Chief Sylvia Moir, who saw video of the crash, told the San Francisco Chronicle late Monday that it ""would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode (autonomous or human-driven) based on how she came from the shadows right into the roadway.""

The Tempe Police Department said in a statement later that the department does not determine fault in vehicle collisions. ""Ultimately the investigation will be submitted to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office for review and any potential charges,"" it said.

It was not clear whether a lawsuit would be filed on behalf of Herzberg's estate.

Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina with expertise in self-driving cars, said most states, including Arizona, require drivers to exercise due care to avoid hitting pedestrians on a roadway, even if the pedestrians use an unmarked crosswalk.

Sergei Lemberg, a California-based lawyer who has brought several lawsuits against self-driving car manufacturers, said that Uber, Volvo, which manufactured the sport utility vehicle, and any companies that supplied self-driving technology could potentially be held liable if litigation ensued from the Tempe accident. The ""safety"" driver who was behind the wheel but who appears not to have operated the vehicle could also be named as a defendant, Lemberg said.

""Suing all these parties would be my top thought right now,"" he said.

Uber said in a statement it was fully cooperating with local authorities investigating the accident.

Volvo, the Swedish car brand owned by China's Geely, confirmed its vehicle was involved in the crash but said the software controlling the SUV was not its own. Volvo said in 2015 it would accept full liability when one of its vehicles equipped with its own self-driving system was in autonomous mode. The company said in 2017 it had agreed to supply Uber with 24,000 self-driving vehicles.

Until now, most litigation over non-fatal accidents involving self-driving vehicles has been confidentially settled, according to legal experts. A case in which a motorcyclist sued General Motors after a collision last year with one of the company's autonomous test cars in San Francisco is pending.

GM has said in a statement regarding the lawsuit that in its collision report the San Francisco Police Department determined that the autonomous vehicle was not at fault in the accident.

Legal experts said liability in the Tempe case would depend on the facts of the accident and the results of U.S. National Highway Safety Administration and National Transportation Safety Board investigations.

With no driver, spotlight on design

Car accident litigation usually turns on whether a driver acted negligently, or failed to exercise a reasonable level of care.

By contrast, a lawsuit involving an autonomous vehicle could revolve around whether the self-driving system had a design defect, legal experts said.

Design defect claims do not require a finding of fault or negligence. To prevail, a plaintiff must show only that a product had an inherent design defect that would render it unsafe.

Automakers and software writers could counter with detailed data gathered by on-board sensors on how cars behaved during a collision, experts said, to show that it was impossible for the vehicle to avoid a collision and that all the systems functioned properly.

One question that would likely arise in litigation is whether Uber, Volvo or any companies that supplied self-driving technology entered into indemnification agreements, in which an entity assumes another company's liability costs.

Paul Rafferty, a California-based lawyer who represents carmakers, said such agreements in the autonomous vehicle world are confidential and disputes over indemnification are generally arbitrated or mediated behind closed doors.

Volvo declined to comment on whether it had entered into indemnification agreements with Uber.

Jennifer Dukarski, a Detroit-based lawyer representing suppliers of autonomous-vehicle technology, said the lawsuit filed by the San Francisco motorcyclist against GM raised only negligence claims.

So if any litigation in the Arizona accident alleges design defect claims, it could set legal precedent and be ""very impactful"" on the nascent autonomous vehicle industry, she said.

Regardless of who is at fault, the University of South Carolina's Smith said he would expect Uber, which has faced past scrutiny over its business practices, to settle any litigation quickly to avoid the public spotlight.

""Only if Uber believes that it was wholly without fault could I see this case going to trial,"" he said.

Google Reportedly Acquires Lytro for $40 Million, VR Enhancements Likely to Be Prime Objective,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/google-acquires-lytro-40-million-vr-1826924,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 19:22:26 +0530","Google is reportedly acquiring Lytro, an imaging startup that is currently building a proprietary light-field technology to enhance virtual reality (VR) experiences. The new move comes as an addition to Google's light-field experiments that it revealed last week. It is likely to help the company expand its Daydream VR platform that was launched in November 2016. Mountain View, California-based Lytro started its journey in the imaging world as a camera company by launching its first-generation consumer light-field cameras in 2012, though it distinguished its existence in the VR space by bringing Lytro Immerge that it claims to be the world's first light-field solution for VR.

According to TechCrunch, the acquisition is valued at more than $40 million (approximately Rs. 260 crores) and is described by a source as an ""asset sale"". This suggests that Lytro may retain its ownership on the existing developments even after the closure of the acquisition. However, neither Google nor Lytro has so far revealed any details about the deal. It still appears that Google would get not just the technology and resources owned by Lytro but also its 59 patents that are mainly for light-field and other digital imaging developments.

Founded in 2006 by Stanford University alumnus Ren Ng, Lytro gained huge popularity for building light-field cameras. While the first Lytro camera debuted in a telescope shape, the company in 2014 launched its upgrade with a conventional DSLR-like build. In 2016, the company brought Lytro Cinema as a light-field capture system for cinematic content.

Lytro has top-tier venture capitalists on board, including Andreessen-Horowitz, Greylock Partners, NEA and Correlation Ventures. Moreover, in 2011, it was reported that Apple's former CEO Steve Jobs even met with Ng to improve the camera experience on iPhones.

Last week, Google announced the release of a 'Welcome to Light Fields' app for the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Windows Mixed reality headsets. The company also importantly highlighted its focus towards capturing and processing light fields to enhance VR experiences. It modified a GoPro Odyssey Jump camera to record nearly a thousand outward-facing viewpoints on a 70-centimetre sphere to eventually create a more realistic sense of presence in VR than before. All this is expected to get a real picture through Lytro resources.","Google is reportedly acquiring Lytro, an imaging startup that is currently building a proprietary light-field technology to enhance virtual reality (VR) experiences.

Arizona Says Not Time to Rein in Self-Driving Cars After Uber Fatality,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/transportation/news/arizona-says-not-time-to-rein-in-self-driving-cars-after-uber-fatality-1826923,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 19:20:32 +0530","Arizona officials said on Tuesday they saw no immediate need to tighten rules on the testing of self-driving cars in the state in reaction to a fatal accident involving an Uber autonomous vehicle that has focused attention on the safety of the new technology.

Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp said it will pause autonomous vehicle testing following Sunday's accident in which an Uber Technologies self-driving SUV struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona.

Automakers and tech companies are evaluating whether or not to suspend their autonomous vehicle programs in the wake of the first fatality involving a self-driving vehicle. Uber said on Monday it was suspending its own program.

Toyota said it was temporarily pausing its testing on US public roads to help its test drivers, who could be experiencing ""an emotional effect"" from the incident.

""This 'timeout' is meant to give them time to come to a sense of balance about the inherent risks of their jobs,"" the automaker said in a statement.

Uber, along with other technology companies and automakers, has been testing in Arizona, which regulates autonomous vehicles with a lighter touch than neighbouring states such as California.

The state has a long history of allowing automakers to test new vehicles on its wide, open roads, and a 2015 executive order by Governor Doug Ducey paved the way for companies to test autonomous technology without interference by the legislature. More than 600 self-driving vehicles are now testing on Arizona roads, according to the governor's office.

On Tuesday, Arizona's director for policy and communications at the state's department of transportation, Kevin Biesty, said existing regulations were sufficient and that the state had no immediate plans to issue new rules.

""We believe we have enough in our laws right now to regulate automobiles,"" Biesty told Reuters. ""There will be issues that the legislature will have to address in the future as these become more widespread.""

During the early phase of self-driving vehicle testing, Arizona refrained from adding new restrictions on companies testing on state roads, Biesty said, adding they did not believe any new regulations would add to safety.

Biesty said his agency was waiting for federal safety regulators to conclude an investigation before drawing any conclusions. Arizona's self-driving vehicle oversight committee has not planned any meetings or actions, he said.

Also on Tuesday, Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell issued a statement saying he supported Uber's decision to suspend testing until the end of the investigation. His office said the mayor had not asked other autonomous vehicle companies to suspend testing in the city.

Full details are still forthcoming surrounding the death on Sunday night of pedestrian Elaine Herzberg after she was struck by Uber's test vehicle, a Volvo SC 90 sport utility vehicle, operating in autonomous mode.

Herzberg, who was homeless, was crossing a four-lane road with her bicycle outside of the crosswalk when she was struck.

The Maricopa County Attorney's Office in Phoenix said it was awaiting the results of an investigation by Tempe police before reviewing whether any charges should be filed. Officials with the National Transportation Safety Board and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also are investigating.

The Tempe police department said in a brief statement it ""would like to reaffirm that fault has not been determined in this case.""

The NTSB said investigators had viewed video captured by a camera in the Uber vehicle, and were gathering data from the vehicle and Uber. A photo posted on Twitter by the NTSB showed the front right corner of the vehicle's hood seriously dented. Investigators will be in Tempe for the rest of the week and will not release findings until reviews of information from the scene and analysis of vehicle data are finished, the agency said.

Uber's Advanced Technologies Group office in Tempe appeared empty on Tuesday except for a security guard who said only a small security crew was working at the site since the accident. The autonomous vehicles normally filling the parking lot outside were nowhere to be seen.

The fatality is drawing fresh attention to the safety of autonomous vehicles, and the challenges of testing them on public streets. Self-driving cars have been involved in minor accidents, but nearly all have been blamed on human motorists hitting the autonomous vehicle.

The outcome of the investigations in Arizona will be pivotal for companies racing to profit from robo-taxi services and automated delivery vehicles. Among them are General Motors Co, Alphabet's Waymo unit, ride services company Lyft, Ford Motor Co and others.

Waymo earlier this month said it began operating self-driving vehicles in Arizona without human minders, offering rides to select customers. GM, through its Cruise Automation unit, has said it plans to launch a robo-taxi service next year, and said on Tuesday it stood by that timeline.

Self-driving startup nuTonomy, owned by Aptiv, said it was temporarily halting its testing on public roads in Boston, following the city's request.

Analysts and experts said the fatality involving Uber could slow progress towards deployment in the sector.

""What this incident indicates is that the state of autonomous driving (and especially Uber) is very far from where it needs to be to become market-ready,"" Richard Windsor, technology analyst for London-based Edison Investment Research, said in a blog post on Tuesday.

"Facebook Messenger Enhances Group Chat Experience With Admin Privileges, Joinable Links",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/facebook-messenger-group-admin-privileges-joinable-links-1826922,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 19:17:18 +0530","Facebook Messenger has received a bunch of new features to enhance your group chat experience. There are admin privileges as well as joinable links and real-time voice and video chats support within groups to make users stick to group conversations on Messenger. These new updates are also aimed to uplift the last year's record of supporting the creation of over 2.5 million new groups on a daily basis.

First in the series of new changes is the availability of admin privileges that add the approval of a group administrator for adding new members. This means any new members will not be a part of the group you've created, without your permission or another admin. You need to approve new members from your side to let them start catching up with other members of your group. Further, admins have also been provided with the ability to remove any existing members if needed, and promote or demote a member in the group chat as an admin.

The option to require admin approval for new members is by default disabled on Facebook Messenger. However, you can enable it by going to your group chat setting.

Alongside admin privileges, Facebook Messenger has added joinable links to let you easily invite new people to your group chats. Anyone in a group chat can create a custom invite link and share it using either the Messenger app or any third-party messaging app. People who tap the link will either be added to the group instantly, if approvals are off, or will be added after admin approval.

To take on group chats on Skype, Facebook Messenger has included real-time voice and video chats in groups with a limit of up to 50 people at a time. This is more than the limit of 25 people for a group video chat or conference call on Skype. Moreover, you can add contacts to your in-progress voice and video chats without any interruption in the conversation, as per the company.

""Messenger is a great way to connect to the groups of people you care about most - helping you spend time together online or even better, making plans to spend time together in real life,"" said Drew Moxon, Messenger Product Manager, in a statement.

The new group-focused features are expected to be rolled out for the Facebook Messenger app for Android and iOS devices. You also need to use the latest app version on your hardware to experience the changes.","Facebook Messenger has received a bunch of new features to enhance your group chat experience.

"In India, Digital Gold Sellers Hope Trickle Will Become a Rush",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/in-india-digital-gold-sellers-hope-trickle-will-become-a-rush-1826920,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 19:15:53 +0530","A digital revolution is reshaping India's $34 billion (roughly Rs. 2.21 lakh crores) gold market, with smartphones, e-wallets and flexible investment schemes drawing new buyers into a business dominated by traditional, face-to-face transactions.

Digital payment systems have ballooned in popularity in India since the government scrapped large-value bank notes in 2016.

Among these offerings are applications that enable smartphone users to buy, sell or store gold - even in small amounts - kept in secured vaults operated by MMTC-PAMP India Pvt Ltd, a joint venture between MMTC Ltd, the largest national trading firm, and Swiss gold refiner PAMP.

Although online gold purchases have been growing globally for years, they are a relatively recent phenomenon in India, where jewellery and bars of the precious metal tend to be kept in hand and given as gifts.

""In India, the action is really starting now. The digitisation of the economy will certainly lead to digitisation of gold,"" said Somasundaram PR cq, Managing Director of World Gold Council's (WGC) India operations. ""It is poised for significant growth, possibly in the next 12-24 months.""

The WGC estimated total Indian gold demand at 727 tonnes (25.6 million ounces) in 2017, and could be up to 800 tonnes in 2018. In China, the top consumer, 2017 demand was 953.3 tonnes.

It is difficult to gauge how many new buyers are entering the market because of online access. The e-wallet operator Paytm said that in the first six months after it began offering digital gold last April, it facilitated about $18.4 million (roughly Rs. 120 crores) worth of sales - a tiny fraction of the Indian gold market.

With the vast majority of purchases made in the traditional way, demand for physical gold isn't abating, ""especially when physical gold plays an important role at Indian weddings,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK Ltd.

Newly attractive

Besides convenience, Indian consumers are attracted to competitive pricing and ability to make purchases in tiny increments.

Gold-based financial offerings, including Gold Accumulation Plans (GAPs), allow users to buy and store gold in fractions as small as 0.1 grams - an amount that would be an uneconomical to trade physically because of the associated handling costs.

These accumulation plans, along with gold-backed bonds and websites selling coins and jewellery that can be shipped for free or cheaply within India, are especially appealing to young Indians. In the past, even those with an enduring affinity for gold have needed to wait until they have saved enough to build holdings.

Joe Jacob, a 29-year-old entrepreneur in the southern city of Bengaluru, recently bought 5 rupees (8 cents) worth of digital gold as a ""trial investment.""

""Physical gold is a hassle in terms of storage, and I don't wear gold, but understand it is an asset to hold. Digital gold is better than storing the actual metal at home, worrying about its safety,"" he said.

Security experts said that because the gold, guaranteed to physically exist in an MMTC PAMP vault, was insured, there was little risk of fraudulent sales.

And digital wallet providers expect interest to grow.

Paytm leads the crowded e-wallet space in India and announced two new gold gift and savings plans this month after launching its first digital gold product in April 2017. The company, backed by Japan's SoftBank Group and China's Alibaba, sources its 24-carat gold from MMTC PAMP.

""There is no 'season' for this product; it is running twenty-four seven. Sitting in their offices, homes or wherever they want, they can easily access, buy sell or redeem,"" said Gaurav Singh, Deputy General Manager of Marketing at MMTC PAMP.

Gold trading traditionally peaks around festival and wedding seasons, experts say.

But Singh added that because digital gold lowers the minimum price needed to buy gold - from about Rs. 3,000 previously, enough to buy roughly 1 gram of gold at current prices - and boosts market transparency via live pricing, there has been a rise in the frequency of gold purchases at other times of the year.

Nitin Misra, Senior Vice President at Paytm confirmed a similar trend, noting ""about 40 percent of sales"" happen during the ""off-season"" for buying gold in India.

He said more than half of the company's users were repeat customers, and 70 percent were younger than 35. As of December 2017, about 1.4 million of its customers held some gold balance in their e-accounts.

""We have stumbled upon a brand new segment,"" he said of younger users buying gold. ""What we have done, is not cannibalize the existing market, but grown it.""

The company said last year it planned to sell $200 million (roughly Rs. 1,300 crores) worth of gold in the 2017 fiscal year, which ended March 1. But its reported sales in 2017 appeared to be headed far short of that number.

Its rival e-wallet provider PhonePe was upbeat.

""The gold consumption market is expected to grow by 35 percent from 2015 to 2020, and customers are exploring digital options for purchase,"" it said in an emailed statement.

For Bangalore-based P Vinoth, a logistics consultant who still prefers buying ornaments and jewellery from retail stores, e-wallets now offer an alternative. ""For long term, I previously invested in exchange-traded funds. Now I am using Paytm gold,"" he said.

""This current legal vacuum is creating a serious shortfall in the public revenue of our member states,"" France's Moscovici told a press conference in Brussels. ""We estimate this could generate at least five billion euros a year if the tax is imposed at 3 percent.""

Moscovici insisted it was ""not an anti-GAFA tax nor an anti-US tax"", referring to the popular acronym for Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.

The transatlantic blow has been championed by French President Emmanuel Macron and will be discussed over dinner at an EU leaders summit on Thursday.

EU startups spared

The unprecedented tech tax follows major antitrust decisions by the EU that have cost Apple and Google billions and also caught out Amazon. The EU tax would affect revenue from digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data.

The tax lands as EU agencies are also set to tighten rules on data privacy, targeting tech firms. That file has come to the forefront following revelations that a firm working for Trump's US presidential campaign harvested data on 50 million users of Facebook.

The EU tax plan will target mainly US companies with worldwide annual turnover above 750 million euros ($924 million), such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Airbnb and Uber. Spared are smaller European startups that struggle to compete with them.

Brussels is seeking to choke tax-avoidance strategies used by the tech giants that, although legal, deprive EU governments of billions of euros in revenue.

Under EU law, firms like Google and Facebook can choose to book their income in any member state, prompting them to pick low-tax nations like Ireland, the Netherlands or Luxembourg.

As an example, Amazon operates across the bloc, but is headquartered in tiny Luxembourg, which has offered sweetheart tax deals that have allowed the firm to pay low effective taxes.

'Hostile act'

The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay. These numbers are, however, disputed by the tech giants, which have criticised the tax as a ""populist and flawed proposal"".

""At the very least, the tax is prone to be interpreted by the US as a hostile act in the already begun trade war,"" wrote tax specialist Johannes Becker in a blog post tweeted by the Computer & Communications Industry Association.

Under the EU plan, revenue from the digital tax would be fairly distributed to where the companies actually operate, according to the level of activity in those countries and not the level of booked profit.

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week firmly warned Europe against jeopardising the major contribution tech firms make to US jobs and economic growth.

""The US firmly opposes proposals by any country to single out digital companies,"" Mnuchin said.

The EU's Moscovici sought to reassure that ""these proposals are neither a response to a French request nor a response against the United States"".

The EU has been on tenterhooks amid fears of a global trade war since Trump this month suddenly announced steep duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium.

The EU's trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem is in Washington this week trying to get the bloc exempted. EU President Donald Tusk on Tuesday said the bloc's response would be ""responsible and reasonable"".","The EU on Wednesday unveiled proposals for a digital tax that targets US tech giants, heaping more problems on Facebook after revelations over misused data of 50 million users shocked the world.

Uber and Careem Ride-Hailing Services Ordered to Cease Operations in Egypt,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/uber-and-careem-ride-hailing-services-ordered-to-cease-operations-in-egypt-1826915,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 19:07:37 +0530","Egypt suspended the licences of ride-hailing companies Uber and Careem on Tuesday, in a court ruling after taxi drivers sought to shut down the two firms' operations in the country, judicial sources said.

Forty two Egyptian taxi drivers filed a lawsuit a year ago against US-based Uber and its Dubai-based competitor Careem, arguing they were illegally using private cars as taxis. They also claimed that the two firms were registered as a call centre and an internet company, respectively.

Khaled al-Gammal, a lawyer acting for the taxi drivers, said

The court suspended the two companies' licenses, banned their apps and suspended the use of private cars by the two ride-hailing services.

Tuesday's decision was effective immediately, meaning the companies must suspend services pending a final ruling, although the companies have 60 days to appeal, the judicial sources said.

Uber said it would appeal and it was not immediately clear when a final ruling would be issued.

Careem said it had not yet received any official request to stop operations in Egypt, and continued to operate as normal.

Uber intends to appeal any court decision to suspend ride sharing licences in Egypt, an Uber spokesperson said.

""We will do all we can to ensure millions of Egyptians can continue to enjoy the benefits of on-demand transportation,"" the Uber official said.

""We are fully committed to working with the entire sector - including taxis - to improve mobility in Egypt together. We will appeal this decision, and continue to be available in Egypt in the meantime.""

Uber said Egypt is its largest market in the Middle East, with 157,000 drivers in 2017 signed up and 4 million users having used the service since its launch there in 2014.

The San Francisco-based company said last year it was committed to Egypt despite challenges presented by sweeping economic reforms and record inflation. In October Uber announced a $20 million (approximately Rs. 130 crores) investment in its new support centre in Cairo.

It has had to make deals with local car dealerships to provide its drivers with affordable vehicles and adjust its ride prices to ensure its workers were not hit too hard by inflation.

Egypt is one of Uber's fastest-growing markets, its general manager in the country, Abdellatif Waked, has said, according to state news agency MENA.

Egypt's investment ministry said last year that a draft law regulating web-based transport services would provide a legal framework for companies like Uber, but did not say when that bill was likely to be passed.

Uber has faced regulatory and legal setbacks around the world amid opposition from traditional taxi services. It has been forced to quit several countries, such as Denmark and Hungary.

Last year, London deemed Uber unfit to run a taxi service and stripped it of its licence to operate. Uber is appealing against the decision.

"Twitter Failing Women as Online Abuse Flourishes, Says Amnesty",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/twitter-failing-women-as-online-abuse-flourishes-says-amnesty-1826912,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 19:05:22 +0530","Many women cannot express themselves freely on Twitter without fear of violence or abuse, Amnesty International said on Wednesday, even though the #MeToo campaign has helped women to speak out.

Abuses ranged from 'doxing' - releasing personal documents such as a person's address or children's names - to posting nude pictures, the rights group said, as it launched a campaign to get Twitter to step up its response to violations.

""Many women are logging onto Twitter to find death threats, rape threats and racist or homophobic slurs littering their feeds,"" Azmina Dhrodia, a researcher with Amnesty and author of its #ToxicTwitter report, said in a statement.

""If Twitter is allowing violence and abuse against women to flourish on the platform, the danger is that someone experiencing that will censor or silence themselves as a result,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Twitter was not immediately available to comment. In October, however, the company pledged to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment and impose stronger penalties for misconduct.

The report follows an international study this month that found women politicians on Twitter were judged more harshly than their male peers on appearance and marital status, and were three times more likely to receive sexist comments.

Amnesty said it asked Twitter in January for information on how many reports of abuse it gets, the number of reports that were in violation of Twitter's rules, and its response times.

It published a reply from Twitter which said the data could be ""misleading"" as some users report content that they disagreed with for political reasons in a bid to get others blocked.

Twitter also noted it had made dozens of changes over 16 months to improve safety, and, according to Amnesty, said it ""cannot delete hatred and prejudice from society"".

""We are not asking them to solve the world's problems. We are asking them to make concrete changes that truly demonstrate that abuse against women is not welcome on Twitter,"" Dhrodia said.

In a poll last year, Amnesty found a third of women who experienced online abuse stopped giving opinion. It found 43 percent of women in Britain and 22 percent in the United States felt Twitter's response to abuse or harassment was inadequate.

Twitter does have a number of tools to help users, including options to block followers, to change settings to avoid seeing certain words, and to report abuse.

In a written response to Amnesty, Vijaya Gadde, who is Twitter's general counsel, said limiting accounts that violated the service's rules on abuse had improved behaviour.

Gadde did say Twitter continued to see repeat offenders who create new accounts when suspended.

Twitter's hateful conduct policy states that the company does not ""tolerate behaviour that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another person's voice"".

"No, Driverless Cars Aren't Far Safer Than Human Drivers",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/transportation/news/no-driverless-cars-arent-far-safer-than-human-drivers-1826908,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 19:00:23 +0530","Self-driving cars have claimed their first pedestrian fatality, a woman in Tempe, Arizona, who was struck and killed by an Uber vehicle travelling in autonomous mode. Weren't self-driving cars supposed to be safer than those piloted by fallible humans?

And who says they aren't? As many on social media rushed to point out, more than 37,000 people were killed by human-piloted vehicles in 2016. Compared with that, one pedestrian fatality, however sad, looks pretty good.

This argument is appealing. Unfortunately, it's wrong.

Motor vehicle fatalities are measured in terms of ""vehicle miles travelled,"" which is just what it sounds like. In 2016, there were 1.18 fatalities for every 100 million miles that Americans drove. Since Americans drove nearly 3.2 trillion miles that year, that still added up to tens of thousands of deaths.

To know whether self-driving cars are safer than the traditional kind, you'd have to know how many miles they travelled before incurring this first fatality. And the answer is "" fewer than 100 million"" - a lot fewer. Waymo, the industry leader, recently reported logging its 4 millionth mile of road travel, with much of that in Western states that offer unusually favourable driving conditions. Uber just reached 2 million miles with its autonomous program. Other companies are working on fully autonomous systems, but adding them all together couldn't get us anywhere close to 100 million. (The numbers go up if you add Tesla's autopilot, but that system has more limited capabilities, and fatality statistics don't necessarily get any clearer - or more favourable - if you do.)

One fatality at these numbers of road-miles driven does not suggest, to put it mildly, a safety improvement over humans. It's more like dramatic step backward, or if you like, a high-speed reverse.

Which is not to say that we should pull the plug on autonomous driving. For one thing, regular old-fashioned cars were none too safe when they first arrived on American roads. In 1921, the first year for which such data is available, there were 24 deaths for every 100 million vehicle miles travelled. Over time, improved cars, drivers and roads reduced that figure by nearly 95 percent. Presumably, self-driving cars can also improve.

Given their other benefits, it's worth working for those improvements, regardless of whether these cars are currently less safe than human drivers. Think of all the elderly forced to leave their homes when they can no longer drive, the people whose disabilities make it hard or impossible for them to operate a car, the barroom drunks who get behind the wheel because there's no easy way to get home. Autonomous vehicles promise to solve these major problems; we should pursue that promise, even at the temporary cost of some road safety now.

Especially since it's not clear that there is actually a cost in road safety. The glib insistence that self-driving cars are safer than human drivers is not well-founded - but neither is a counterreaction that insists that they're obviously much more dangerous.

Even if you could design a system that you knew would have one fatal accident every hundred million miles on average (roughly the same as a human driver), that wouldn't mean that the car would strike and kill someone just as the odometer hit 100 million. The accident might occur on mile 5 million, or mile 99 million - or heck, you might get lucky and not have a fatality until mile 115 million. It's not possible to confidently assess the risk of an accident based on a single event like this. Statistical regularities that are apparent in large data pools get lost in the noise when the sample is too small.

We won't know how dangerous self-driving cars are compared with human drivers until they've driven billions more miles. At the moment, we just know that they can kill people, not how often they will. And that's a possibility that advocates for self-driving cars should have prepared the public for better than they have.

Enthusiasts for autonomous vehicles have been a little too quick to respond to safety concerns by pointing out how many accidents human drivers have - or by noting that self-driving cars don't text, or drive drunk, or fall asleep at the wheel. All true, but as they drive more and more miles, we may discover that they have problems humans don't.

Uber has already pulled its autonomous cars off the road in response to this tragedy. If it hadn't, it seems likely that the public pressure to do so would have been deafening. The company - and advocates of autonomous vehicles more generally - will need to put in a lot of work over the next few months restoring public faith in this technology.

Luckily, software systems can be re-engineered; even if self-driving cars aren't currently safer than a human driver, there's good reason to expect that one day they will be. But we've done that future no service by talking as if it had definitely already arrived. If we tell people that self-driving cars are perfectly safe, and that turns out not to be true, the backlash could drive these vehicles off the road before they're able to deliver on their promise.

China to Become Top Patent Filer Within Three Years: UN,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/science/news/china-to-become-top-patent-filer-within-three-years-un-1826907,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 18:57:19 +0530","China is on its way to becoming the world leader in international patent filings, and should overtake the top spot from the United States within three years, the UN said Wednesday.

A record 243,500 international patent applications were filed last year, a hike of 4.5 percent from a year earlier, the World Intellectual Property Organisation said in its annual report.

These patents ""represent the best new technology that is arising in the world,"" WIPO chief Francis Gurry told journalists in Geneva.

The US kept the top ranking, which it has held for the past four decades, with American-based companies and individuals filing 56,624 applications, or nearly a quarter of the global total.

But it was the rapid growth in international patent filings from China, which passed Japan to reach second place, that drove the global increase, WIPO said.

Chinese companies and individuals filed a total of 48,882 international patents last year, marking a hike of 13.4 percent from a year earlier, the UN agency said.

China, the only country to record double-digit growth in its patent applications in 2017, has posted growth higher than 10 percent every year since 2003.

""At current trends, (China) is projected to overtake the US within three years as the largest source of applications filed under WIPO's Patent Cooperation Treaty,"" the agency said.

""One cannot but notice that there has been a remarkable transformation in the Chinese economy, and that China has gone from a position of being largely a user of technologies to a producer of technologies,"" Gurry said.

He refused to comment on whether US President Donald Trump's expressed anxiety over competition from China was warranted.

But he told reporters that ""China has clearly arrived as a major competitor in the field of technology.""

He stressed though that ""the rise of China does not necessarily mean the decline of others.""

Two China-based telecoms companies topped the global ranking last year: Huawei Technologies, which filed 4,024 patents, and ZTE Corporation, which filed 2,965.

They were followed by Intel Corporation of the United States, with 2,637 patents and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation of Japan, with 2,521.

The ""rapid rise in Chinese use of the international patent system shows that innovators there are increasingly looking outward, seeking to spread their original ideas into new markets as the Chinese economy continues its rapid transformation,"" Gurry said in a statement.

""This is part of a larger shift in the geography of innovation, with half of all international patent applications now originating in East Asia,"" he added.","China is on its way to becoming the world leader in international patent filings, and should overtake the top spot from the United States within three years, the UN said Wednesday.

iPhone X Successor With 5.85-Inch OLED Display Will Be the Cheapest 2018 Model: Report,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/iphone-x-5-8-inch-10-percent-cheaper-manufacture-1826906,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 18:57:13 +0530","Like every year, Apple will be launching its new iPhone models in fall 2018. As per previous reports, the Cupertino giant is expected to launch three iPhone variants this year - a 6.5-inch OLED model, a 6.1-inch LCD model, and a 5.8-inch OLED model. According to new information, the 5.8-inch variant of the 2018 iPhone will be cheaper to manufacture, despite the OLED display. This could be an indication for Apple fans to expect a price drop from the massive $999 price point of the iPhone X that was launched last year.

Digitimes Research analyst Luke Lin said in a research note, the new 5.8-inch model of the iPhone will have a total bill of materials (MBOM) over 10 percent lower than the iPhone X had when it was initially launched. Lin says in the report that the iPhone X MBOM was more than $400 in 2017. Due to this cost reduction, the report says, ""Apple may position the new 5.85-inch device as the cheapest model of all three next-generation iPhone models.""

Interestingly, Lin says Apple had previously planned to bring another LCD version of the 5.85-inch iPhone. However, the project was suspended ""mid-February and may be eventually terminated."" The company was reportedly planning to launch the LCD version of the handset ""due to MBOM concerns.""

The report also added that, due to a weak demand of the iPhone X, Apple took fewer OLED panels from Samsung Display, which resulted in ""more bargaining chips"" for the latter in negotiations for the manufacturing of 2018 iPhone. While this could have led to price increments, the report claims that Apple has already reached an agreement with Samsung Display ""with satisfactory terms.""

Lin believes that the 5.85-inch OLED iPhone can be launched as the cheapest of the three new models. He says that engineering samples have shown that this particular model has adopted components with lower specs than in the 6.1-inch LCD iPhone. Interestingly, LPDDR memory (RAM) will be one of the biggest differences, the report claimed.","As per previous reports, the Cupertino giant is expected to launch three iPhone variants this year - a 6.5-inch OLED model, a 6.1-inch LCD model, and a 5.8-inch OLED model.

Google Closes $2.4 Billion Chelsea Market Deal to Expand New York Campus,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/google-closes-2-4-billion-chelsea-market-deal-to-expand-new-york-campus-1826902,"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 18:54:26 +0530","The $2.4 billion sale of New York's Chelsea Market to Alphabet Inc's Google closed on Tuesday in a deal that will expand the company's presence in the city's technology corridor along the Hudson River.

The sale of the 1.19 million square foot complex that includes ground floor shopping and a food hall marks a coup for asset manager Jamestown LP, which acquired a 75 percent stake in the former Nabisco factory in 2003 for $280 million.

Jamestown bought out its partners in 2011 in a deal that valued the building at $795 million, according to media reports.

The building is adjacent to Google's New York headquarters at 111 Eighth Avenue, one of the city's largest buildings that it bought in 2010 for $1.77 billion. That building also was developed by Jamestown along with Taconic Partners.

The deal highlights New York as a hub for innovation and an incubator for young technology companies, said Michael Phillips, president of Jamestown. The sale was first reported in early February.

The sale also showcases a Manhattan real estate market that has not lost strength, said Doug Harmon, a broker at Cushman & Wakefield who represented Jamestown in the deal.

""People have been saying the cycle is long in the tooth,"" said Harmon, who also brokered the 2010 deal with Google.

Google also has leased space on Pier 57 jutting into the Hudson, which will create a four-block campus.

AFP- Google buys NYC's Chelsea Market building for $2.4 bn

Google on Tuesday bought up New York's Chelsea Market for $2.4 billion, finalizing its acquisition of the emblematic retail and food hall that stands opposite the internet giant's current headquarters in the city.

Google had already paid $1.7 billion for the building facing the market in 2010, which has 275,000 square metres of office floorspace.

It already has offices in the Chelsea Market building -- built in 1913 by architect Albert G. Zimmerman as a factory for the Nabisco biscuit company -- which serve as offices for the Google-owned online company Youtube.

Google bought the latest property from real estate developers Jamestown, which acquired the building in 2003 and will continue to manage the popular food court on the ground floor, Jamestown said in a statement.

The gourmet food hall houses dozens of restaurants and high-end food stands and in the last two decades has become a highlight of Chelsea and the Meatpacking District, its trendy neighbour.

The building sold for $280 million in 2003, and in 15 years its value has increased eightfold, reflecting the meteoric rise in the city's property prices. Tuesday's sale was one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in New York's history.

The 110,000 square-meter property will be added to the 1932 building forming a hi-tech Google ""campus"" in the east coast city.

The New X1 Carbon weighs only 1.27 kg and has the durability promised by most ThinkPad devices. In fact, this goes a notch further and is forged from Carbon Fiber, which weighs less than magnesium and aluminum but is stronger than both. It features an Adaptive Keyboard, which dynamically adjusts based on the software or application being used to highlight the most relevant keys. It also integrates voice and gesture control.

The ultrabook will also have a ColorBurst Display for sharper, brighter images as well as the Rapid Charge technology offering 80% charge in under an hour. Plus, Lenovo claims the new battery can last up to 9 hours. There is even an optional built-in 4G capability.

Hoping that Windows 8 finally gets the mobile adoption everyone has been predicting, the new ThinkPad 8 tablet comes fully equipped to be used as a productivity device. So you can connect to a keyboard or display for a full PC experience, link to a dock or monitor for desktop Mode and use the Quickshot Cover to have a tent mode. Along with an 8 MP high definition camera and super bright 8.3-inch 1920x1200 display, it also comes loaded with the wireless Miracast technology. The premium tablet will come with the latest Intel Bay Trail Quad Core processor and up to 128GB of storage, and run Windows8 Pro.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon will cost upwards of $1299, while the ThinkPad 8 convertible tablet will be priced $399 and Topseller models start at $429 and will be available late January.

Misbehaving sun delays space station supply flight,http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/misbehaving-sun-delays-space-station-supply-flight/1217221/,"Thu, 09 Jan 2014 05:44:24 GMT","Antares rocket, which is planning to launch a Cygnus spacecraft on a cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station, is seen at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility. (Reuters)

A strong solar storm is interfering with the latest grocery run to the International Space Station.

On the bright side, the orbiting lab has won a four-year extension, pushing its projected end-of-lifetime to at least 2024, a full decade from now.

''This is a big plus for us,'' said NASA's human exploration chief, Bill Gerstenmaier.

On Wednesday, Orbital Sciences Corp. delayed its space station delivery mission for the third time.

Another launch attempt will be made Thursday afternoon.

The company's unmanned rocket, the Antares, was set to blast off from Wallops Island, Virginia, with a capsule full of supplies and science experiments, including ants for an educational project. But several hours before Wednesday afternoon's planned flight, company officials took the unusual step of postponing the launch for fear that solar radiation could doom the rocket.

Orbital Sciences' chief technical officer, Antonio Elias, said solar particles might interfere with electronics equipment in the rocket, and lead to a launch failure.

After evaluating the situation all day Wednesday, Orbital Sciences decided to aim for Thursday at 1:07 p.m. EST (1807 GMT).

The solar flare peaked Tuesday afternoon and more activity was expected, but the company determined that the space weather was within acceptable risk levels. The sun is at the peak of a weak 11-year storm cycle.

Although the solar storm barely rated moderate, some passenger jets were being diverted from the poles to avoid potential communication and health issues. GPS devices also were at risk.

But the six men aboard the space station were safe from the solar fallout, NASA said, and satellites also faced no threat. The Cygnus cargo ship aboard the rocket, for example, is built to withstand radiation from solar flare-ups.

The storm also will push the colorful northern lights farther south than usual to the northern U.S.

Marissa Mayer gets her Yahoo moment,http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/marissa-mayer-gets-her-yahoo-moment/1217001/,"Wed, 08 Jan 2014 22:19:40 GMT","Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer unveiled a handful of new products, including a competitor to Google's predictive search technology for smartphones, in a debut appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show that drew a big crowd.

The former Google executive, who took the reins at Yahoo in 2012, has moved aggressively to revamp the struggling firm's business with acquisitions and a renewed focus on its media offerings.

Yahoo's services attracted more than 400 million monthly mobile users for the first time last fall, Mayer said, surpassing the 390-million mobile users it announced in October. Speaking in a keynote at the annual technology industry gathering in Las Vegas, Mayer announced Yahoo's acquisition of Aviate, a company which makes a smartphone app that automatically brings up relevant information or other apps to suit a user's activity.

""Imagine if your phone can deliver the right experience to you at the right time instead of you having to search for it,"" Mayer said. ""What if your phone suggested music and map apps when you got in your car or fitness apps when you got into the gym?""

The technology, which Mayer said will be rolled out under the Yahoo banner this year, appears similar to Google Now, which the search giant introduced in 2012.

While Yahoo's revenue growth has yet to pick up under Mayer's leadership, the 38-year-old CEO has brought pizzazz back to a brand considered by many to be past its prime.

That said, how long it can sustain in the cut-throat and ever-evolving smartphone market, will depend on how swiftly it can incorporate the changing dynamics of the market. But if the recently launched Andi Uddaan smartphone is any indication, the nearly 13-year-old maker of pen drives and PC accessories is definitely on the right track.

The iBall Andi Uddaan is essentially targeted at women and it is as girly a gadget as can be with hearts and crystals studded on to the pink and ivory body, as well as the home screen. That's not all. The company gives a pink back cover, a little pink purse and a pink flip cover, among other regular accessories, inside the box.

However, what makes Uddaan unique is a feature dedicated exclusively to women's safety. The so-called SOS button at the back (in the shape of a heart), when pressed, sets off a loud alarm alerting people nearby. What's more, text messages are sent and phone calls are made automatically to five pre-defined emergency contacts, with the text message providing the geographical location of the phone's owner in real time. The message also gets posted to the mobile phone owner's Facebook account.

The tracking facility in the phone allows the user to add her daily route on the map and authorise up to 10 people to track her movements live on the map. This can be useful in times of emergency and the company has used women's safety as a key advertising plank. Not a bad strategy at all and brilliant timing too. Other safety measures include an ICE feature that allows the user to save vital information such as blood group, medical history, details of people to contact in case of any emergency etc.

Swipe Halo Value+: Tablet that can also make calls,http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/swipe-halo-value-tablet-that-can-also-make-calls/1216979/,"Wed, 08 Jan 2014 21:46:51 GMT","Swipe Telecom has introduced its Halo Value+ 7-inch tablet which packs a mediocre 800 x 480 pixels display and runs on Android 4.1 Jelly Bean platform. The overall build quality of Halo value+ is good, feels solid and you get a plastic-chrome finish at the back that may be prone to scratches. One cannot really ask for much at this price hence we are more than willing to offer our fair judgment. The dual-core processor does a fine job, however 512 MB RAM is a let-down, leading to frequent lagging and slowdown while gaming and even multitasking.

The tablet's in-built speaker surprised us and stood out as a good outlet for music, but on-the-go one should always prefer switching to earphones. Calling quality on the Halo Value+ is decent and we did not face any network or connectivity issues. However, the front camera is strangely placed at the bottom right of the display.

In terms of benchmark tests, the Halo Value+ scored 8,998 on Antutu, 3,404 on Quadrant and 1,302 on Vellamo HTML5. We have compared these scores with that of Lava Xtron which at 9,810 (Antutu) 3,710 (Quadrant) and 1,475 (Vellamo HTML5) fare better than Halo value+ at lower price point.

The battery on Halo Value+ is not long lasting and stood our battery test of running HD movies on Wi-Fi at full brightness for just over three and half hours. On normal usage you are sure to get anywhere between 6 to 7 hours.

Overall, Swipe has created a market for itself in tier II and III cities and we can see why. The Halo Value+ offers everything you need plus calling at price less than R7,000. Go for it if you want an entry-level calling device or you can look at Lava E-tab Xtron without calling support.

A couple of years ago, there were many who would look down upon people using a Micromax phone. There are still many of those people around. But Micromax is no longer the ""cheap phones brand"" it used to be. In fact, at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas, the world's largest stage for technology and gadgets, this Indian company showed that it means business. Business at a global level to be precise.

Known in India for bringing top-end specs at mid range prices, Micromax's big global announcement was chip giant Intel's first dual-boot Windows and Android tablet. Intel has been trying its best to get a foothold in the mobile space, and with the second largest smartphone maker in the second largest smartphone market. So it is actually a coup of sorts for both companies.

Incidentally, around the same time, Taiwan's Asus too announced an Intel-powered Transformer Book Duet TD300, running both Android and Windows 8 on the same processor. But that is more of laptop. This is a more of a tablet. Hence Micromax's is the first dual-boot tablet. The definitions in tech are that thin these days.

Announced at CES on Monday, the Micromax LapTab will be available for consumers in February. It is powered by an Intel Bay Trail-M processor and will be this first-of-its-kind tablet will run both Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and Windows 8, with just a reboot enabling the switch over.

At the launch, Micromax co-founder Rahul Sharma made it clear this was their ""next leap"", ""raising the innovation bar globally"". We should have know this was coming. It was just months ago that the company signed Hollywood heart-throb Hugh Jackman as its brand ambassador. That was indication enough that this company was not eyeing just India, it had the world in its sight. After all, a lot of hinterland India, where Micromax has been making hay for a few years, would not even recognise the wolverine star.

Mobile phones are a must have and will continue to grow but at a slower pace, with opportunities moving away from the top-end premium devices to mid-end basic products,"" said Ranjit Atwal, Research Director at Gartner. ""Meanwhile users continue to move away from the traditional PC (notebooks and desk-based) as it becomes more of a shared content creation tool, while the greater flexibility of tablets, hybrids and lighter notebooks address users' increasingly different demands.""

Mobile phones are expected to dominate overall device shipments, with 1.9 billion mobile phones shipped in 2014, a five per cent increase from 2013. Ultramobiles, which include tablets, hybrids and clamshells, will take over as the main driver of growth in the devices market from 2014, with a growth rate of 54%

In the OS market, Android continues to be the OS of choice across all devices. Gartner estimates that Android will reach 1.1 billion users in 2014, a 26 % increase from 2013. ""There is no doubt that there is a volume versus value equation, with Android users also purchasing lower-cost devices compared to Apple users. Android holds the largest number of installed-base devices, with 1.9 billion in use in 2014, compared with 682 million iOS/Mac OS installed-base devices,"" said Annette Zimmerman, Principal Analyst at Gartner.

A US firm claims to have designed the world's first antimicrobial touchscreen glass which can combat bacteria and fungi.

The firm Corning said its Antimicrobial Gorilla Glass is formulated with an antibacterial agent, ionic silver, which is incorporated into the glass surface for sustained activity.

The glass can be installed in electronic devices such as computers, cellular phones, calculators, telephones, and other electronic display panels, the company said.

According to Corning, as touch technologies proliferate, consumers are becoming aware of how bacteria can exist on mobile devices, particularly as we increasingly share touch-enabled surfaces at home, work, and elsewhere.

""Corning's Antimicrobial Gorilla Glass inhibits the growth of algae, mold, mildew, fungi, and bacteria because of its built-in antimicrobial property, which is intrinsic to the glass and effective for the lifetime of a device,"" said James R Steiner, senior vice president and general manager, Corning Speciality Materials.

The glass is being tested with numerous manufacturers for various applications, and high-volume production capability has been demonstrated.

""As more people move through shared work spaces, there is an increased need for antimicrobial surfaces,"" said Allan Smith, vice president of Product Marketing for Steelcase.

The company said antibacterial wipes, foams, sprays, and films exist today, but they are temporary, and many device manufacturers advise against them.

Other areas for the glass include frequently touched interior architectural surfaces in the health care, hospitality, and transportation industries, the company said.

Viral Oza, director marketing of Nokia India, also said the company had no intention of bringing the Lumia 2520 tablet to India, as the networks in the country were not capable of hosting the LTE device.

There is a top layer that has a very global outlook and they will get the same products as the rest of the world. Then there is a bottom layer. We are trying to make products that more relevant and within reach of these so-called intenders.

Can you reach the intenders with your existing products? Will you need to make products specifically for markets like India?

There are some products that work in these markets, but we are expanding the portfolio with more products for the intenders.

Your rivals are playing on the Indian mindset of getting something extra for their buck. How will you take this on?

Whatever the consumer is looking for, we will try and give that. What we have picked up are insights on design, sound etc and we will give that in the products over the coming years. We will, for instance, have some good products aimed at the gaming segment and the first time users. We feel these users are getting attracted to other brands. We will continue to be premium, but will come a couple of rungs down the ladder.

What are the consumer insights that you think are peculiar to India?

Indian ears are tuned to more punch and bass. In our entire range we have many products which are good on bass. But we also have products that are good on pure sound. The top layer of buyers are more in tune with the global trend of pure sound, while the intenders are looking for more bass and punch. So lot of the entry level products will have the bass factored in.

WeChat rides the IM wave,http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/wechat-rides-the-im-wave/1215773/,"Sun, 05 Jan 2014 22:21:26 GMT","Unfazed by competition and the emergence of other free messaging apps, Chinas WeChat expects to grow at 100% this year as the instant messaging market in India has grown at a similar pace during 2013

The $100 billion Chinese internet company Tencent's instant messaging app WeChat was the most downloaded non game app in India among the million apps in Apple's appstore for iPhones. The app, which was launched in India in May 2013, globally has 272 million monthly active users and is closely behind the leader WhatsApp that has more than 350 million users.

WeChat in India is being modified locally and marketed by Indian internet company Ibibo. Tencent invested in Ibibo in 2008 and with WeChat emerging as key part of global agenda of the Chinese company, Ibibo team in India has been working on WeChat mostly since 2012. The company is expecting to grow at 100% as the instant messaging market has grown at a similar pace in India during 2013.

""Tencent has done this in the instant messaging era in China and we have the right DNA and insights to back our growth. Getting people to pay for some value addition and let the gaming come at the right time of the critical mass of internet audience. This ecosystem is not built by advertising, but by users. We understand that it is a long game and India is a market of diversities. We are not in a hurry to say that we have reached a milestone as the milestone itself is growing so fast,"" says Rahul Razdan, president of Tencent India.

Razdan is unfazed by competition and the emergence of other free messaging apps and says that an ecosystem of such magnitude cannot be replicated. ""Ecosystems cannot be replicated overnight. Apps may become the flavour of the month,"" he says. The Chinese company is competing globally against others like Snapchat, Japanese player Line, India's Bharti Group's Hike, BlackBerry messenger called BBM and Facebook's Messenger among others.

WeChat, which originated as Weixin in China, being envisaged only for mobile and not being a legacy product coming from web or browser itself sets it apart, he says. According to Razdan innovations like voice messaging, video calls and shaking the phones to identify friends' phones or through QR codes are among the many innovations that sets the platform distinct, he says.

(Reuters)

BlackBerry Ltd said on Friday it had filed a lawsuit against a company co-founded by ""American Idol"" host Ryan Seacrest that offers a physical keyboard that can be attached to some of Apple Inc's touchscreen iPhone 5 models.

The company, Typo Products LLC, is currently taking pre-orders for the $99 keyboard, which features angled miniature keys similar to those used on many of BlackBerry's devices.

Canada's BlackBerry, a once dominant smartphone maker that has lost market share to the iPhone and other touchscreen devices, said Typo's keyboard infringes its own design.

The allegation has not been proven in court. Typo and Seacrest could not immediately be reached to comment on the legal proceedings.

""We are flattered by the desire to graft our keyboard onto other smartphones, but we will not tolerate such activity without fair compensation for using our intellectual property and our technological innovations,"" Steve Zipperstein, BlackBerry's chief legal officer, said in a statement.

BlackBerry posted billions in losses in recent quarters as its latest devices sold poorly, but it has maintained a loyal niche of customers who prefer to type on a physical keyboard.

The BlackBerry complaint is case no. 3:14-cv-23 in the United States District Court for the northern district of California.

Saturn's rings are 4.4 billion years old,http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/saturns-rings-are-4.4-billion-years-old/1215060/,"Fri, 03 Jan 2014 11:11:32 GMT","Saturn's main ring system is huge but razor-thin, measuring about 280,000 kilometres across but just 33 feet or so in the vertical direction. (Reuters)

Researchers using data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft have found that Saturn's rings formed around 4.4 billion years ago, shortly after the planet itself took shape.

The origin of Saturn's ring system remains hotly debated, with some researchers arguing that it's a relatively young structure and others holding that it coalesced long ago, at roughly the same time as the gas giant's many satellites.

The new study, using data gathered by NASA's Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft, strongly supports the latter scenario, researchers said.

Cassini's measurements suggest that ""the main rings would be [extremely] old, rather than hundreds of millions of years old,"" said Sascha Kempf, of the University of Colorado in Boulder.

Saturn's main ring system is huge but razor-thin, measuring about 280,000 kilometres across but just 33 feet or so in the vertical direction.

The rings are composed primarily of water ice, but they contain small amounts of rocky material contributed by micrometeoroid bombardment, 'LiveScience' reported.

Kempf and his colleagues used Cassini's Cosmic Dust Analyzer instrument to measure just how frequently such tiny particles cruise through the Saturn system.

They found that a surprisingly small amount of dusty material comes into contact with the rings.

After measuring the low rate of dust recruitment, the team calculated that the rings have likely existed for about 4.4 billion years.

""It would be consistent with an old ring system,"" Kempf said.

The study was presented at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union.

Have you tried talking a selfie with a DSLR? Well, it is tough to say the least.

What if you could take a selfie with your DSLR but using your iPhone? Sounds weird, right?

The MaxStone is a small coin-size device that fixes to most DSLR models and lets you control the camera using an iPhone app. So with the small MaxStone hanging from the camera you can use your iPhone to click a selfie or a group photo with you in it. The app will also let you click long exposure and time lapse shots without shaking the camera.

There is more to this neat little device, created as a Kickstarter project by New York-based MaxMax Inc. With the MaxStone paired with the phone it can be used as a remote trigger for the iPhone camera as well. Plus, it can also be used to locate the phone when needed. This same feature alerts you if the camera, with the MacStone, attached it take beyond a certain distance of the phone.

The app can be used to control up to four cameras simultaneously, and that means you can take pictures of the same subject from multiple angles if you have so many cameras. The CR2032 battery should last at least six months.

The best thing about the device is the fact that it will cost upwards of $29, almost the same as a cheap remote trigger for your DSLR. The first units are expected to ship in March 2014.

As on Wednesday night, the site SnapchatDB.info has been suspended.

In a statement to TecCrunch, SnapchatDB said that it got the information through a recently identified and patched Snapchat exploit and that it was making the data available in an effort to convince the messaging app to beef up its security.

With Snapchat, users can send photos and videos that disappear shortly after they are viewed and have been lately gaining popularity especially among young users.

"Skype's Facebook, Twitter accounts hacked by Syrian Electronic Army",http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/skypes-facebook-twitter-accounts-hacked-by-syrian-electronic-army/1214523/,"Thu, 02 Jan 2014 05:46:32 GMT","Skype, which is owned by Microsoft, was part of the NSA's program to monitor communications through some of the biggest U.S. Internet companies. (Reuters)

The Syrian Electronic Army, an amorphous hacker collective that supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, claimed credit on Wednesday for hacking into the social media accounts of Internet calling service Skype.

The group also posted the contact information of Steve Ballmer, Microsoft Corp's retiring chief executive, on its Twitter account along with the message, ""You can thank Microsoft for monitoring your accounts/emails using this details. #SEA""

That message was an apparent reference to revelations last year by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that Skype, which is owned by Microsoft, was part of the NSA's program to monitor communications through some of the biggest U.S. Internet companies.

A message posted on Skype's official Twitter feed on Wednesday, apparently by the hacking group, read: ""Don't use Microsoft emails (hotmail, outlook), They are monitoring your accounts and selling the data to the governments. More details soon. #SEA""

Similar messages were posted on Skype's official Facebook pages and on a blog on its website before being taken down in late afternoon. The SEA later tweeted out copies of the message ""for those who missed it.""

Representatives for Microsoft could not be reached for comment.

The NSA's practices essentially made Microsoft and other technology companies partners in government surveillance efforts against private citizens in the United States and elsewhere.

Last month Microsoft joined seven other top technology companies in pressing President Barack Obama to rein in the U.S. government's electronic spying in a meeting at the White House.

Media companies, including the New York Times and the BBC, have repeatedly been targeted by the Syrian Electronic Army and other hacker activist groups that deface websites and take over Twitter accounts.

Obama and his national security team are trying to decide what recommendations to adopt from an outside panel's review of the NSA's activities.

A U.S. District judge in December ruled that the U.S. government's gathering of Americans' phone records is likely unlawful and raised what he called ""serious doubts"" about the value of the so-called metadata counter-terrorism program.

India to have 185 million mobile internet users by June: Report,http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/india-to-have-185-million-mobile-internet-users-by-june-report/1214293/,"Wed, 01 Jan 2014 22:04:11 GMT","One of the reasons for this increase in mobile internet penetration is the fact that the average cost per user fell to Rs 387 from Rs 460 in 2012.

The number of mobile internet users in India seems all set for explosive growth with a report by Internet & Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International predicting that there will be 155 million people accessing the web through their phones by the end of March.

With a quarter-over-quarter growth of 20%, this number is expected to cross 185 million by June 2014, says the 'Mobile Internet In India 2013' report released Wednesday.

According to the report, in October 2013, India had 110 million mobile internet users, with just 25 million in rural India. Urban India's dominance of this segment is expected to continue for at least a couple of quarters.

Indicating that many Indian's were accessing the internet for the first time on mobile devices, the report says across both urban and rural India over half the internet users where on the mobile.

One of the reasons for this increase in mobile internet penetration is the fact that the average cost per user fell to Rs 387 from Rs 460 in 2012, even though the actual per cent of data costs in mobile bills has gone up slightly from 43% to 45% over the past year.

The other reason is the falling costs of Internet enabled smart devices. In fact, a I-Cube Mobile Internet survey conducted in 35 cities in 2013 puts the median cost of web-enabled mobile phone at Rs 7,000 with 52% of mobile internet users owning devices priced between Rs 6,501 and Rs 14,000.

'Why CES is becoming a gamble for tech companies',http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/why-ces-is-becoming-a-gamble-for-tech-companies/1214262/,"Wed, 01 Jan 2014 20:56:31 GMT","In a couple of days, tech journalists and analysts from around the world will start converging at Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the largest such exposition in the world. Like most of the endeavours in the desert city that hosts CES every year, this expo is often a gamble for the large tech companies and small start-ups that vie for eyeballs there. Tech companies try to set the agenda for the rest of the year, launching their most-awaited devices. The start-ups hope their innovations will be picked up by journalists and written about, or just picked up by a larger company, which is even better. This year, the companies will showcase connected cars, smart homes, wearable devices and smarter smartphones, the only catch being that they did the same last year.

In the past few years, CES has not been able to underline what particular innovation or product would become one of the bigger trends of the year. It has tried to set the agenda for the tech year at the heavily-curated environs of the show and the resultant trends are often what the companies want you to think it will be. Often this is wishful thinking, which consumers don't want anything to do with. The guy on the street, who finally buys the gadgets, now has a mind of his own. Pampered by smart but cheap devices, he is becoming more demanding. So, for all the trumpet blowing at CES, the tech firms actually have their fingers crossed, hoping this new product finally catches the fancy of buyers. With too many launches, and too many PR pitches queering the pitch in Vegas, larger players are now patronising smaller shows like the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the IFA in Berlin and the Computex in Taiwan. It is easier for them to connect with audience at these shows than at the melee that CES is slowly becoming.

Google Nexus 5 vanquishes Nexus 4 on all counts,http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/google-nexus-5-vanquishes-nexus-4-on-all-counts/1214233/,"Wed, 01 Jan 2014 19:49:04 GMT","Nexus 5 is no different, and gives experience that Google wants to offer to users on Android.

Google launched its Nexus 5 smartphone globally and much to our surprise, the company redeemed itself for the mistakes it made with Nexus 4 in India by bringing the latest Nexus much earlier than last time around (almost one year). The stock Android 4.4 KitKat version is the best way to differentiate between the experience on a Nexus device and other vendor branded devices. The latest Nexus 5 therefore is no different, and gives the experience that Google wants to offer to users on Android.

LG has flourished under the stewardship of Google for its Nexus devices, enabling it to iron out the flaws they have had in their previous smartphones. With Nexus 5, LG has taken the expectations to a whole new level. It is priced at R29,999 for the 16 GB version and R33,999 for the 32 GB phone.

So what's all the hoopla about Nexus 5 you may ask? For starters, it sports a five inch full high definition display, runs on the latest stock Android 4.4 KitKat OS, packs in a 2.2 GHz Snapdragon 800 CPU with 2 GB RAM and then the usual culprits8 megapixel rear and 1.2 megapixel front cameras, plenty of connectivity options and a 2300 mAh battery.

Not the most good looking smartphone, but it's a definite step up from the glossy looks of the Nexus 4. That said with Nexus 5, you get a well-built sturdy device that comes with Corning Glass 3 display. During our usage, we found the display to be effective and even after some rough treatment the display refused to wither down. The full high definition display is bright, crisp and offers a colourful viewing experience. At 130 grams, the phone is a hair lighter than the Nexus 4, which weighs 139 grams.

The other change in Nexus 5 is the placement of speakers, which are now more conventionally placed at the bottom unlike at the rear as was the case in the Nexus 4. Stock Android version has its hits and misses. The performance is smooth but we did miss some applications that should have been pre-installed.

A group of volunteers from different parts of Assam have made an innovation of sorts by designing an Assamese word processor similar to the Microsoft Word with a spell checker and word suggestions to boot.

Named Jahnabi, the word processor has came as a boon for those who need help in writing the language and can be easily used by those with a rudimentary knowledge of Assamese.

""The website www.jahnabi.org has received more than 60,000 hits and the free-of-cost software downloaded by more than 1,000 people since it was launched online on November 25 last,"" says Mridul Kumar Sharmah, one of the members of the team.

The Unicode compliant software with a size of 7 mega bytes has at present nearly 2.5 lakh Assamese words and 108 readymade Assamese phrases in its dictionary and counting.

""The programming of the processor is based on dotnet platform and C# language containing around 15,000 lines of code,"" Utpal Phukon, the only programmer in the Jahnabi team, said.

It took almost 25 days to complete the beta version of the software and the final software was designed in four months, he said.

The software contains automatic suggestions for words. Just type the alphabet K and all the words beginning with Ka would appear like Kalam and Kamal. There are also 600 Assamese idioms. The user has the option to create a shortcut for frequently used idioms. There is also a facility to add words to the user's dictionary.

""If one types the alphabets K and M, words like Kamal and Kamtapur would be listed. All one has to do is click on the word which is required from the list. This makes it easy for people who do not have an in-depth knowledge of the language,"" Sharmah said.

""The main aim to develop the processor is to popularise the Assamese language through Internet and social networking sites as most of the people in the state have rudimentary knowledge of the language due to reasons best known to them,"" Sharmah said.

"Snapchat, Vine, Candy Crush Saga among top smartphone apps of 2013",http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/snapchat-vine-candy-crush-saga-among-top-smartphone-apps-of-2013/1214096/,"Wed, 01 Jan 2014 05:57:07 GMT","With Snapchat, users can send photos and videos that disappear shortly after they are viewed.

Snapchat, Vine, and Candy Crush Saga earned coveted spots on smartphones this year, making them among the most downloaded apps of the year.

There are more than a million apps on Apple Inc's App Store and Google Inc's Play store, the two dominant marketplaces for apps, which see billions of downloads each year.

This year, the most downloaded apps were new takes on communication, gaming, and entertainment, according to mobile app experts.

""2013 was a really interesting year in terms of maturation, milestones and new trends,"" said Craig Palli, chief strategy officer at Fiksu, a mobile marketing company based in Boston.

""The most downloaded apps were in familiar categories, but offered new twists,"" he added.

While old favorites such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter  available for iPhone, Android and other devices - continued to be popular ways of communicating with friends, Snapchat eclipsed them in downloads in 2013, becoming the sixth most downloaded free app of the year on the App Store, according to Apple.

""Snapchat went from being a niche app to achieving much more critical mass, so much so that Facebook was reportedly willing to spend billions of dollars to acquire the company,"" said Palli.

With Snapchat, users can send photos and videos that disappear shortly after they are viewed.

Launched in 2011, the app's user base continued to grow rapidly in 2013, with over 13 million people using the app in October, according to the lastest available estimates from global information and measurement company Nielsen. In December alone, over 400 million pieces of content were shared through the app, according to Snapchat, based in Venice, CA.

Vine, a video sharing app released earlier this year by microblogging company Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), was the fourth most downloaded free app in 2013. The app, for iPhone, Android and other devices, allows users to share videos under six seconds in length. Nielsen estimates over 6 million people in the US were using the app in October of this year.

Tesco will offer customers a cash rebate of 0.20 ringgit ($0.05) for every bag reused.Each year between 500 billion and 1 trillion plastic bags are used globally, according to industry estimates, with fewer than 10 percent recycled. Many end up in the world's oceans or dumped in landfill.More than 8 million tonnes of plastics enter the ocean each year, and marine experts fear there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050, measured by weight.Plastic degrades over time into tiny particles which are ingested by marine life, harming the food chain and environment.In an attempt to cut down on waste and single-use plastic, many supermarkets around the world charge customers for plastic bags, promote reusable bags, and offer free recycling services.Meanwhile, more than 40 countries have banned, partly banned or taxed single-use plastic bags, including parts of Malaysia and India, China, France, Rwanda, Italy and Kenya.The ""unforgettable bag"" is made from a recyclable plastic that is more durable than conventional plastic bags, Tesco said, and sports a turtle, fish or whale design to highlight the risks plastic waste poses to sea creatures.The Tesco trial - the first of its kind by a major hypermarket in Malaysia - limits the bag discounts to two per transaction.The scheme will be extended to all Tesco's 56 stores in Malaysia from June 1. If a success, the retailer hopes it will be adopted by other Tesco stores across Asia.The barcoded bags are a starting point towards phasing out all plastic bags from Tesco shops in Malaysia, said Azmel.Every Malaysian on average throws away 300 plastic bags a year, according to the Malaysian Plastics Manufacturers Association.Von Hernandez, global coordinator of the Break Free From Plastic movement in Manila, welcomed the Tesco initiative but said governments and business in Asia needed to do more.""We've seen governments - whether at city or national level - take action to restrict the use of single-use plastics,"" said Hernandez.

These two ideas did not really cohere,"" Smith said.By discovering a four-eyed lizard - in which both pineal and parapineal organs formed an eye on the top of the head - the researchers confirmed that the lizard third eye really is different from the third eye of other jawed vertebrates.Smith and his colleagues got the idea that the fossilised lizards might have a fourth eye after other experts came to contradictory conclusions about where the lizard's third eye was located.Smith and colleagues turned to museum specimens collected nearly 150 years ago as part of the Yale College Expedition to the Bridger Basin, Wyoming in the US.CT scans showed that two different individuals had spaces where a fourth eye would have been, which, Smith said, ""I certainly did not expect!"" Their evidence confirms that the pineal and parapineal glands were not a pair of organs in the way that vertebrate eyes are.They also suggest that the third eye of lizards evolved independently of the third eye in other vertebrate groups.Smith said that while there is ""nothing mystical"" about the pineal and parapineal organs, they do enable extraordinary abilities.For instance, they allow some lower vertebrates to sense the polarisation of light and use that information to orient themselves geographically.","BERLIN: An extinct species of monitor lizard had four eyes, a first among known jawed vertebrates, a fossil study has found.

It said the ministry took into account the “seriousness of air pollution that has direct impact on the human population” and therefore decided to waive of public\stakeholders’ consultation before notifying these standards under the Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2018.Normally, the ministry first puts out draft notification in public domain for comments.

It had also in December 2015 notified revised standards for coal-based thermal power plants (TPPs). The new standards, based on the recommendation of the central pollution control board (CPCB), were aimed at reducing emission of particulate matter (PM10), sulphur dioxide and oxide of nitrogen which would, in turn, help in bringing about an improvement in the ambient air quality (AAQ).Enforcement of these standards for coal-based power plants have, however, been quite patchy with majority of the plants failing to meet the ministry’s earlier deadline of December 7, 2017.Citing practical difficulties, the central electricity authority ( CEA ) had later sought extension of deadline for installation of necessary equipment to control emissions up to December, 2022 - five years more than what the TPPs had agreed in 2015.Even the environment ministry had in December last year supported the CEA’s move in the Supreme Court .

The concept is simple. Rather than jogging on by the garbage littered on the street, ploggers pick it up and dispose of it correctly instead.To plog even more effectively, some ploggers fit in some additional exercises as they bend to pick up litter — to keep their heart rate pumping. And it turns out the exercise really pays off — for the environment and your body.According to fitness app Lifesum, which allows users to input and track calories burned while plogging , the eco-friendly work-out is significantly more effective than just jogging.As plogging requires some bending and arm strength to hold all the garbage, a half hour of plogging will burn 288 calories on average - compared to just 235 calories from regular jogging.On social media, the plogging craze is also gaining popularity as people share photos of the trash they’ve collected or realise that they’ve actually been plogging all along. On Instagram, the exercise has been tagged in over 3,000 posts and various Facebook groups dedicated to the workout have popped up. So the next time you go for a jog, try stopping to gather any garbage while you are at it as your body and the environment will thank you.","A new work out trend from Sweden may be capable of keeping you in shape and saving the planet.Plogging, a combination of jogging and the Swedish term “plocka upp,” meaning pick up, is sweeping the globe — and the streets clean of garbage.

I just forget about it for a while,” he added.Why an elephant would consume charcoal, which has no food value, has led to speculation among wildlife scientists. According to Varun R Goswami, an elephant biologist at WCS India, charcoal has well recognised toxin-binding properties, and although it may not have much nutritional content, animals may be attracted to it for this medicinal value.It can also serve as a laxative, thereby doubling its utility for animals that consume it after forest fires, lightning strikes, or controlled burns, Goswami said.“Charcoal ash has traditionally been used for dental hygiene in India. After the video went around, there was also some speculation that the elephant was trying to cure a toothache,” Kumar said.Kumar said the sight of the jumbo puffing away had startled him and his team.(With inputs from Bengaluru)","Kumar told TOI that the video was shot in the morning nearly two years ago.

When people turn forest managers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-people-turn-forest-managers/articleshow/63458983.cms,"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 01:10:32 GMT","India’s degraded forests are seeing a turnaround. From curbing rhino poaching to stopping tree felling and regenerating biodiversity, local communities have taken ownership of their forest homes in several states.The catalyst has been the Forest Rights Act of 2006 (FRA). The community forest resource (CFR) rights provision of the Act empowers forest-dwelling tribal communities to protect and manage forests. Community rights have been recognised in less than 3% of forests so far, says Community Forest Rights—Learning and Advocacy Group, a coalition of organisations. But some of the success stories have been documented by Centre for Science and Environment in its ‘People’s Forests’ report released last week.Shruti Agarwal of CSE says: “These are stories of community empowerment, which suggest that a new future of democratic forest governance is emerging. They create confidence in the ability of communities to manage and conserve their forests, and to generate sustainable livelihoods from them.”In 2012, the tribal villages of Nayakheda, Payvihir, Upatkheda and Khatijapur were given charge of a highly degraded forest area of 990ha. Even the assistant conservator of forests of Amravati admits they “received the worst forests”. In the first year, villagers focused on planting bamboo and moisture conservation. They weeded out invasive species like lantana and non-useful trees like gum tree, planted by the forest department. In Payvihir village, they put a stop to the department’s auction of custard apple trees for a meagre Rs 1,500, and began marketing the fruit themselves, earning Rs 16,000 in the first year. “These villages have identified forest patches to be kept untouched from any intervention to observe the biodiversity and evolution of natural flora and fauna… Nayakheda has built watering holes for wildlife,” observes the CSE report. Payvihir gram sabha won the UNDP biodiversity award in 2014 for its work on decentralised forest governance.Villagers in Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary got CFR rights over 67% of the area in 2013-14. In the first year, 16 villages inside the sanctuary harvested a bumper crop of 96,319 MT of bamboo because of a good flowering season and earned Rs 185 million in revenue. A dozen villages decided to plough back 30% of the profits into forest protection and the rest into community development. The villagers have started working on ways to avoid forest fires, plant indigenous species, and manage water conservation.The lives of women in Madhikol changed after the village got CFR rights in 2016. The gram sabha, consisting of six men and six women, framed rules for patrolling of forests, protection from fires and sustainable harvest of forest produce. The practice of burning tendu bushes before the plucking season was stopped as the fire destroyed new plants of other important species. Earlier, tribal women would stitch siali leaves into plates and sell them to middlemen at a throwaway price of Rs 10 for 80 plates. In 2016, they formed a collective and began exporting the plates, earning Rs 50,000. Panchgaon was the first village in the district to get CFR rights. The village mandated each household to come up with at least five ideas for management of the forests. Eventually, 115 regulations were finalised. “Thus, the entire village was party to the decisions taken and the gram sabha’s success in governing its CFRs can be partly attributed to this inclusive and democratic approach,” says the report. Voluntary patrolling of forests is mandatory here. The most important decision of the gram sabha was a ban on removal of tendu leaves, forgoing huge revenue. “The collection of tendu leaves requires extensive lopping and setting fires in the forest, affecting the growth of trees and, in turn, the production of edible tendu fruit. Tendu leaves are used to make bidis which are not good for health. On the other hand, birds eat the tendu fruit; and so do we,’ Ramesh Tamke, gram sabha member told CSE researchers.The state government refuses to recognise the Adivasis’ CFR rights. But forest communities in north Bengal have been assertive. Twelve villages in the Chilapata forests of Coochbehar constituted gram sabhas who filed CFR claims in 2008-09 and passed resolutions to conserve forests and wildlife. In 2014, they resisted the forest department’s felling operations in elephant corridors as this could have aggravated man-animal conflict. “The village compelled the forest department to seek the permission of its gram sabha and carried out a survey of the trees marked by the department for felling. As more than 1,400 trees of native species would be cut down, the gram sabha refused permission,” states the report. It quotes Mahesh Rava from Kodalbasti village: “Our forests are better now. You should have seen them before 2008. We stopped illegal removal of boulders and sand from the rivers as well.” Villagers also claim incidents of rhino poaching have reduced significantly because of their patrolling measures.","From curbing rhino poaching to stopping tree felling and regenerating biodiversity, local communities have taken ownership of their forest homes in several states.The catalyst has been the Forest Rights Act of 2006 (FRA).

Warming climate will displace millions in coming decades: World Bank,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/warming-climate-will-displace-millions-in-coming-decades-world-bank/articleshow/63369096.cms,"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 14:32:26 GMT","WASHINGTON: The number of people fleeing crop failures, droughts and rising sea levels will grow drastically over the next three decades if world governments do not intervene, according to a World Bank report released Monday.By 2050, 86 million ""climate migrants"" will be displaced in Sub-Saharan Africa, 40 million in South Asia and 17 million in Latin America -- 143 million in all -- according to the report, which the bank said was the first to address the question of migration spurred by climate change.These regions are home to more than half the developing world's population, with 2.8 percent of inhabitants among those at risk, the report said.So far climate change has inexorably become an ""engine of migration,"" forcing individuals, families and even whole communities to seek more viable homes, World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva said in prepared remarks presenting the report.""Every day, climate change becomes a more urgent economic, social and existential threat to countries and their people,"" she said.""The number of climate migrants could be reduced by tens of millions as a result of global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and with far-sighted development planning.""The report's authors conducted three case studies to quantify their findings. In Ethiopia , the population could almost double by 2050 while migration will rise due to diminishing harvests.By that year in Bangladesh, climate migrants could be the single-largest group among all internally displaced persons.And in Mexico, people will increasingly gravitate towards urban areas from regions vulnerable to climate change.At a recent conference of the International Organization for Migration, France's Minister for Ecology and Solidary Transition Nicolas Hulot said the climate was already displacing twice as many people as conflicts were, and that it might already be the main cause of migration.Gilbert Houngbo, president of the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development , said fast-growing rural populations in Sub-Saharan Africa that cannot grow enough food to feed themselves were particularly vulnerable.The region's inhabitants currently number 645 million but will add another 1.4 billion by 2055, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization Nevertheless climate-linked migration need not descend into humanitarian crisis, according to the World Bank.Researchers believe the number could be reduced by 80 percent if countries reduce emissions, account for migration in development planning and make investments in studying the process of internal climate migration.They developed three scenarios: a worst case, involving high greenhouse gas emissions, a scenario in which better environmental policies are enacted and one with greater development.""Without the right planning and support, people migrating from rural areas into cities could be facing new and even more dangerous risks,"" Kanta Kumari Rigaud, a chief author of the report, said in a statement.""While internal climate migration is becoming a reality, it won't be a crisis if we plan for it now.""","""Every day, climate change becomes a more urgent economic, social and existential threat to countries and their people,"" she said.

Novel protein 'mat' can soak up pollution: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/novel-protein-mat-can-soak-up-pollution-study/articleshow/63352217.cms,"Sun, 18 Mar 2018 05:44:36 GMT","LOS ANGELES: In a breakthrough, scientists have created novel protein mats that can soak up and trap chemical pollution Despite years of effort to stabilise proteins outside of their native environments, scientists have made limited progress in combining proteins with synthetic components without compromising protein activity.The study, published in the journal Science, shows a path toward exploiting the power of proteins outside of the cell by demonstrating a unique way to keep proteins active in synthetic environments.The materials presented in the study could enable on-demand biochemical reactions where they were once not feasible.""We think we've cracked the code for interfacing natural and synthetic systems,"" said Ting Xu, professor at University of California , Berkeley in the US.Proteins are usually unstable outside their native environments. To function properly, proteins must fold into a specific structure, often with the help of other proteins.To overcome this challenge, researchers analysed trends in protein sequences and surfaces to see if they could develop a synthetic polymer that provides all the things that a protein would need to keep its structure and function.""Proteins have very well-defined statistical pattern, so if you can mimic that pattern, then you can marry the synthetic and natural systems, which allows us to make these materials,"" Xu said.Researchers created random heteropolymers, called RHPs. RHPs are composed of four types of monomer subunits, each with chemical properties designed to interact with chemical patches on the surface of proteins of interest.The monomers are connected to mimic a natural protein to maximise the flexibility of their interactions with protein surfaces.The RHPs act as unstructured proteins, commonly seen inside cells. They increased membrane protein folding in water during protein translation and preserved water-soluble protein activity in organic solvents.The researchers at Northwestern University in the US ran extensive molecular simulations to show that the RHP would interact favourably with protein surfaces, wrap around protein surfaces in organic solvents and weakly in water, leading to correct protein folding and stability in a non-native environment.They then tested whether they can use an RHP to create protein-based materials for bioremediation of toxic chemicals, which they were funded to do by the Department of Defense.They mixed RHP with a protein called organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH), which degrades the toxic organophosphates found in insecticides and chemical warfare agents.The researchers used the RHP/OPH combination to make fibre mats, submersed the mats in a well-known insecticide and found that the mats degraded an amount of insecticide weighing approximately one-tenth of the total fibre mat in just a few minutes.This opens the door to the creation of larger mats that could soak up toxic chemicals in places like war zones.""Our study indicated that the approach should be applicable to other enzymes,"" Xu said.""This may make it possible to have a portable chemistry lab in different materials,"" he said.","""We think we've cracked the code for interfacing natural and synthetic systems,"" said Ting Xu, professor at University of California , Berkeley in the US.Proteins are usually unstable outside their native environments.
""Proteins have very well-defined statistical pattern, so if you can mimic that pattern, then you can marry the synthetic and natural systems, which allows us to make these materials,"" Xu said.Researchers created random heteropolymers, called RHPs.

DCPCR asks school to admit kid under EWS quota,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/dcpcr-asks-school-to-admit-kid-under-ews-quota/articleshow/62892226.cms,"Sun, 11 Feb 2018 18:45:00 GMT","NEW DELHI: Five-year-old Divyanshu Kamti has lost his EWS quota seat in a Pitampura private school because his name in the birth certificate didn’t match that on the online form. Now, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights DCPCR ) has issued a show-cause notice to the school, directing it to admit the child immediately pending an inquiry.Divyanshu’s name appeared in the first list of the directorate of education (DoE) last year for admission under the right to education’s EWS quota norms. But when Divyanshu’ father, Naresh Singh Kamti, went to PP International School in Pitampura to get the documents verified, he was turned away as in the birth certificate, the boy’s name was recorded as Sudhanshu.DCPCR officials said the parents had changed his name and later produced a fresh birth certificate with the changed name, an advertisement in the newspaper — as per the procedure — and an affidavit on the change dated July 25, 2017 (a copy of it is with TOI). They said the parents had also corrected the discrepancy in the online entry to reflect the new name. The commission has said the school is “determined to not allow the child from attending it”.The school, however, claimed that for any such change, “a proper legal process has to be followed to validate it. DCPCR is not taking cognisance of any such thing”. Possession of two birth certificates, it said, was “bad in law”.Moreover, Deepi Bector, its vice-principal, said it had got three names for the boy — one in the online form, another in the document and a third one on DoE’s list. The documents, she claimed, were from Bihar, and the parents had overshot the deadline to produce the correct ones. “We cannot give any benefit of doubt in such a case because we have to follow the DoE norms.”However, citing the DoE rules, DCPCR said a declaration made by the parents about the child’s age was enough proof for admission. It added that the school also questioned the authenticity of the income certificate. According to it, the school has no right to make judgements about the veracity of a document, which should be duly done by the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM). The commission has asked the administration to write to the SDM about the school’s concerns.Bector refused to discuss the matter further, calling it sub judice.","NEW DELHI: Five-year-old Divyanshu Kamti has lost his EWS quota seat in a Pitampura private school because his name in the birth certificate didn’t match that on the online form.

"India’s forest cover increases by 1%, but NE a cause for concern",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/indias-overall-forest-cover-marginally-increases-over-the-last-2-years-forest-cover-in-5-northeastern-states-decline/articleshow/62887748.cms,"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 12:54:31 GMT","NEW DELHI: India’s forest cover increased by 6,778 sq km over the last two years with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha and Telangana increasing their green footprint during the period though there is a worrying decline in six northeastern states, including a shrinkage of 630 sq km in the eastern Himalayas.While overall green cover, including tree patches outside recorded forest areas, reported an incremental 1% increase (8,021 sq km) over the last assessment year in 2015, the quality of forests remain a hotly debated subject even as satellite monitoring has increased availability of data.The increase, based on satellite data and subsequent ‘ground truthing’, has put the total forest cover at 7,08,273 sq km which is 21.54% of the country’s geographical area.Releasing the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2017 on Monday, the environment ministry looked at the overall green cover (total forest and tree cover) of 8,02,088 sq km and pitched it as a success of multiple afforestation programmes.Though this figure puts green cover at 24.39% of India’s geographical area, this does not reflect a complete picture as it includes tree cover of 93,815 sq km, primarily computed by notional numbers.In the past, studies have argued that the problem of depletion and over-exploitation of forests has taken a toll of India’s forests and their sustainability and the problem of simplifying a maze of rules and tune conservation with the needs of local communities remains a challenge.Taking into account the density (canopy covering branches and foliage formed by the crowns of trees), forest cover is divided into ‘very dense’, ‘moderately dense’ and ‘open’ forest. The ‘very dense’ forest cover has increased over the last assessment of 2015, but the ‘moderately dense’ category reported a decline — a sign which environmentalists consider quite worrying.Referring to decline in the ‘moderately dense’ forest category and enhancement of forest cover in ‘open’ forest and ‘scrub’ categories, forest expert from Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) Ajay Saxena said, “This negative correlation means that India is losing good forests for developmental pressures, forest degradation and climate change.”Saxena termed the increase in ‘very dense’ forest (VDF) cover as a “positive development”, but said a major part could be attributed to increase in the number of districts assessed in the new report compared to 2015.The ISFR updated the number of districts for its assessment from 589 to 633. The ministry, however, claimed that the change in area was calculated “using updated figures” to facilitate comparison on a common methodological platform.Underlining that very dense forest had increased from 85,904 sq km in 2015 to 98,158 sq km, environment and forests minister Harsh Vardhan said, “This is very heartening as VDF absorbs maximum carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.”He said consistent increase in forest cover over the years was in sync with India’s commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change and the country would meet its target of creating additional carbon sink (2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent) through increase in forest and tree cover by 2030.The report showed that forest cover in six north-eastern states — Mizoram, Nagaland , Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Meghalaya and Sikkim — decreased in 2017. Experts believe forests in the eastern Himalayas are rich in forest carbon and decline in forest cover in the region could have been avoided. This area reported a net loss of 630 sq km of pristine forests.The ISFR 2017 shows that about 40% of the country’s forest cover is present in nine large contiguous patches of the size of 10,000 sq km or more. It also shows the total mangrove cover stands at 4,921 sq km and has shown an increase of 181 sq km. All the 12 mangrove states have shown a positive change in the mangrove cover, as compared to the last assessment. Mangrove ecosystem is rich in biodiversity and provides a number of ecological services.The India State of Forest Report 2017 is the 15th such report in the series. The report, however, for the first time contains information on decadal change in water bodies in forest during 2005-2015, forest fire, production of timber from outside forest, state wise carbon stock in different forest types and density classes.The report notes that there was an increase of 2,647 sq km in the extent of water bodies over the decade (2005-15) with all states and Union Territories (UTs) showing an increase except Arunachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.It shows that overall the extent of water bodies has increased from 14,509 sq km in 2005 to 17,156 sq km in 2015 with Maharashtra (432 sq km), Gujarat (428 sq km) and Madhya Pradesh (389 sq km) figuring as the top three states reporting maximum increase in areas of water bodies including lakes and wetlands.“We wish that in future, extent and change in forest cover vis-e-vis major river basins in the country should be assessed and reported since forest cover is a key parameter to assess the health of our rivers”, said river and water expert, Manoj Misra, of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan.Reacting on report which shows marginal increase in forest cover, Misra said, ""Increase in forest cover is a matter to rejoice unless statistical jugglery is behind the claim.""The spatial information given in the report is based on interpretation of LISS-III data from Indian Remote Sensing satellite data (Resourcesat-II) with a spatial resolution of 23.5 meters. Satellite data for the entire country was procured from NRSC for the period October, 2015 – February, 2016.“The satellite data interpretation is followed by rigorous ground truthing. In addition, extensive ground data collected by field parties at more than 18000 points all over the country and information from other collateral sources are also used to improve the accuracy of the interpreted image”, said the environment ministry after releasing the ISFR 2017.Report shows that three states - Andhra Pradesh (2141 sq km), followed by Karnataka (1101 sq km) and Kerala (1043 sq km) - have shown the maximum increase in forest cover. On the other hand, forest cover in states like Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Meghalaya has decreased in 2017 as compared to 2015.Madhya Pradesh has the largest forest cover of 77,414 sq km in the country in terms of area, followed by Arunachal Pradesh with 66,964 sq km and Chhattisgarh (55,547 sq km). In terms of percentage of forest cover with respect to the total geographical area, Lakshadweep with (90.33%) has the highest forest cover, followed by Mizoram (86.27%) and Andaman & Nicobar Island (81.73%).","Experts believe forests in the eastern Himalayas are rich in forest carbon and decline in forest cover in the region could have been avoided.

Kambar, the third Kannadiga to head the Indian Academy of Letters since its inception, defeated his closest opponent and Odia writer Pratibha Ray in a secret ballot.Of the 89 members of the general council who voted in Monday’s elections, 56 voted in favour of Kambar, while 29 members voted for Ray as president. The third contender for the top job, Marathi writer Bhalchandra Nemade, could only get four votes.Conventionally, the vice president of the Sahitya Akademi is elevated to the post of president. However, this is not the first time an election to the post was necessitated. What writers find discomforting this time, though, is a repeat of the 2003 polls where partisan politics — a ‘Left verus Non-Left’ theme — has resurfaced and taken centrestage at the Akademi.Back in 2003, the presidential contest was between the Bharatiya Jnanpith award-winning writer, Mahasweta Devi , and outgoing vice-president of the Akademi, Gopi Chand Narang. Mahasweta Devi, despite her stature as a doyen of literature and of the work she had done among tribals, was defeated during the elctions. Urdu critic Narang, on the other hand, had won 56 of the 94 votes that were polled.While the non-Left had triumphed then, murmurs within the academy of letters on Monday suggested Kambar’s victory was a reassertion of Sahitya Akademi’s relative autonomy in comparison to the other cultural bodies that have allegedly been infiltrated by right-leaning administrators.Shortly after being declared President of the Sahitya Akademi, Kambar, also the first vice-chancellor of Kannada University in Hampi, said he was looking forward to providing a platform to regional languages in India and to counter the eurocentric thurst on Literature. Kambar also thanked outgoing president Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari and said he will remain committed to taking Sahitya Akademi to greater heights.Over the last few years, Sahitya Akademi has been at the centre of considerable controversy, including the ‘award wapasi’ campaign where writers returned their Sahitya Akademi awards as a mark of protest against the rising culture of intolerance in the country.","NEW DELHI: Eminent Kannada writer and Jnanpith award winner Chandrashekhara Kambar was elected president of Sahitya Akademi on Friday.

These are Ramadevi Women's University at Bhubaneswar, Gangadhar Meher University at Sambalpur and Khallikote Cluster University at Berhampur. The last two universities got land for their second campuses, but the RD University is yet to get even a suitable location for establishment of its second campus.Recently, the state government drew flak for forming a committee to select a 30-acre land inside the Utkal University for second campus of the RD University.

The SC, while hearing an application challenging the constitution of the committee, on Monday, said the VC’s appointment will be subject to the outcome of the case. Candidates had to apply to the committee by February 14.The petitioner, A D Sawant, a former MU pro-vice-chancellor, said the committee’s constitution is in contrary to the UGC regulations. He said the committee is liable to be quashed or a stay be granted on the process initiated by it. The SC has not stayed the process.Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao, chancellor of state universities, appointed eminent scientist and former ISRO chief K Kasturirangan as chairman of the committee in October last year after former VC Sanjay Deshmukh was asked to step down from the VC’s post. The state appointed Cidco vice-chairman Bhushan Gagrani as their nominee, while Shyam Lal Soni, director of NIT Uttarakhand, was Mumbai University’s nominee.In his application in an already pending special leave petition of 2013 filed during former vice-chancellor Rajan Welukar’s tenure, Sawant, claimed that Kasturirangan, despite being an eminent scientist, is not from the ‘sphere of higher education’, has ‘not worked in the university academic system’, and has ‘no exposure to higher education systems in India or abroad’ as prescribed by the UGC, said Sawant’s counsel Dilip Taur. The same was said about Gagrani, an IAS officer in the administrative field and therefore, described as lacking ‘academic excellence’. Taur added that none of the members were fit to assess the eligibility and qualifications of the applicants.Sawant told TOI:, “The state follows UGC norms while appointing professors and assistant professors; why are they selective in the VC’s appointment process. The last VC (Deshmukh) appointed by the search committee had to be asked to step down for mismanagement. In the past too, retired judges were appointed on the committee, who were not related to the field of academics.”But whether the current search committee will be dissolved to make way for new members can’t be said. In the past, a search panel under the chairmanship of Professor Andre Beteille from Delhi University was dissolved by the governor as issues on the constitutional validity of the panel arose. Later, a new committee appointed Welukar, whose appointment was questioned throughout his tenure. “If the government goes ahead with the current committee, the appointment will continue to be under a cloud till the pendency of the case,” said an MU official.","MUMBAI: Two days before the deadline to apply for Mumbai University’s vice-chancellor’s post, the appointment of the search committee that will choose a candidate is under a cloud.

Sri Reddy: I’m not afraid, will continue my fight against sexual harassment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/sri-reddy-im-not-afraid-will-continue-my-fight-against-sexual-harassment/articleshow/63683697.cms,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:30:00 GMT","The controversy surrounding TV presenter-turned actress Sri Reddy and her fight against Tollywood’s casting couch menace only seems to be getting bigger. What started out as an actress speaking out on social media about the exploitation of women in the Telugu film industry, has now turned into a full-blown war between Sri Reddy and the Movie Artistes’ Association (MAA). Sri Reddy’s nude protest on the streets — outside the Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce in the plush locality of Film Nagar — has gotten the country to sit up and take notice and prompted MAA to finally break its silence over the controversy, which has been raging for nearly a month now.MAA dismissed Sri Reddy’s allegations as a “cheap publicity stunt” and declared that she will not be given MAA membership under any circumstance. “Not only this, action will be taken against any artiste who decides to share screen space with her,” MAA President Sivaji Raja threatened.Not one to back down, Sri Reddy questions the legality of the ‘ban’ against her. “On what basis will they ban me? They have no right to do so. As a woman, I have the right to protest and to speak my mind. How dare they ban me and threaten other artistes?” she fumes.We have every right to stop artistes from working with Sri Reddy: MAA PresidentSlamming Sri Reddy for her “publicity seeking stunt”, MAA President reiterated that she will not be given membership and that the association is well within its rights to prevent their artistes from working with her. “First of all, she isn’t even our member so there’s no question of us banning her. As per our by-laws, we have the right to tell our artistes not to work with Sri Reddy. We will now take the legal route to deal with her. We have already filed a police complaint against her and will be taking legal action,” Sivaji states, adding condescendingly, “Anyway, who would want to make a film with her? Have you seen her? The way she is behaving is embarrassing.When asked why she’s been denied membership, Sivaji says, “Why is she now speaking about membership after five years of being in the industry? We had considered her application but she has shown an utter disregard for our rules and we’re well within our rights to deny her membership.”Let them bring their lawyers, I will bring mineSri Reddy, however, feels that she’s being denied membership only because she has been asking uncomfortable questions. “By denying me membership and preventing other artistes from working with me, they are sending out a message to all women that this is what will happen to them if they speak up about the harassment and abuse that they face. But I will not be deterred. Let them bring their lawyers, I will bring mine,” she retorts.Why is MAA still silent on casting couchThe actress, who has been raising the issue of casting couch, and the physical, mental and sexual harassment of women in the Telugu film industry for over a month, said that MAA representatives are yet to address the issues she has raised.“They held an hour-long press conference and said all sorts of things against me. But they didn’t say a word about casting couch, sexual abuse and other issues that I have raised. In fact, the only reason they are even speaking now is because my protest has reached the national media and they cannot avoid it anymore. This is nothing, but a face-saving attempt from them. But I’ll continue to fight,” Sri Reddy says, defiantly.We are here to listen to women: MAA president Sivaji RajaWhen cornered, MAA representatives stated that the association is always ready to “listen to women and their grievances” and that they had solved many issues in the past. Sri Reddy, however, questions why there isn’t a Committee against Sexual Harassment (CASH) in place? “Why is there no CASH in the film industry? Lots of women face harassment on the sets of a film too. A director may ask them to wear clothes she may not becomfortable with, an actor might touch her inappropriately, a spotboy might stare at her creepily — who will they complain to then? After 9:30 pm, most MAA members are not reachable. Shouldn’t there be a separate committee to look after women’s safety?” Reddy asked.MAA President Sivaji Raja acknowledged this issue finally, and confirmed to us that they are thinking of setting up a CASH committee now. “We are in talks with our lawyers regarding the legal procedure and the committee will be set up. Until then, we are always here for women and they can feel free to approach us with any concerns they may have,” Sivaji said.I’ve been asked to vacate my house. The big people have started playing their games.What will it take for this govt to speak up?On Monday, the actress was apparently asked to vacate her house by her landlords. “My address has been leaked online by someone and a bunch of people came here and asked the landlord to remove me from the house. The big people have started playing their games already,” she says. urging the Telangana government to break its silence, she adds, “All I have been saying from day one, is that women feel unsafe in the film industry, local talent is being ignored and actresses are being sexually harassed. Because of this, people are targeting me. The Telangana government has conveniently avoided the issue. Why is KT Rama Rao, who speaks so much about women empowerment, silent today? Why isn’t Kavitha, who claims to be a symbol of strength for women in the state, not reaching out when I’m protesting in the nude? What it will it take for this government to react,” she asks, helplessly.With Sri Reddy continuing her protest and taking her movement to the national stage, it remains to be seen if the government will step in and find a solution.","The controversy surrounding TV presenter-turned actress Sri Reddy and her fight against Tollywood’s casting couch menace only seems to be getting bigger.

Raazi: Alia Bhatt: I don’t think I could have played a more selfless character than Sehmat in 'Raazi',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/alia-bhatt-i-dont-think-i-could-have-played-a-more-selfless-character-than-sehmat-in-raazi/articleshow/63681398.cms,"Mon, 09 Apr 2018 19:30:00 GMT","At 7.45 am today, the much-awaited trailer of Junglee Pictures and Dharma Productions’ ' Raazi ', directed by Meghna Gulzar , will be live for the audience to see. The film, which will open in cinemas on May 11, is an adaptation of Harinder Sikka’s novel, 'Calling Sehmat', and stars Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal in pivotal roles. Excited about the trailer launch, Alia spoke to us about the cinematic and emotional journey of playing Sehmat, an innocent Kashmiri girl who makes the transition to spying for her country after being married off into a Pakistani officer’s family:For me, the best part is that this character is not a Lara Croft. She’s a young, naive girl, who decides to risk her life for her country. This was the most beautiful aspect, because I didn’t have to enact anything. Being brave doesn’t mean that you don’t get scared. The sequences were overwhelming, but I wasn’t afraid of holding on and going all the way. A lot of technical preparation went into playing Sehmat. I had to improve my Urdu and then unlearn what I had picked up, because I play a Kashmiri and I wasn’t required to speak chaste Urdu or Hindi. I even learnt the Morse Code by heart. It was something Meghna believed that I should do authentically, and I feel that it helped me get perfectly into the character. One could have argued that kisi ko kya pata chalega, but we had to be as authentic as possible. I also learnt how to drive a Jonga (a kind of jeep used by the armed forces). Emotionally, one would have never been able to prepare for the journey I set out on, because once we started shooting, it was relentless. We’ve shot nine scenes a day, and that’s something I have never done before. It was a lot of work without a minute to waste or think about anything else. It’s a blessing for an actor, because you just have to be in character all the time, without any distraction.The guilt that Sehmat feels as a wife was the toughest to portray. There were these points in the script where Meghna wrote, ‘Sehmat gives a knowing look’. I used to wonder what it means. We used to giggle about it, but when she explained it to me, I realised what she meant. Sehmat is around so many people, and she’s seeing and hearing so many things. She cleverly camouflages her true feelings with fake reactions that will go well with the people around her at that point. I wondered how I would give ‘that look’. Portraying a spy in the garb of a wife was difficult.It wasn’t a very formal discussion, and when I first met Meghna, 'Raazi' was just an idea. I hadn’t read the book back then. I have never expressed interest in doing a film on the basis of a single-line narration. She returned to me with the film 18 months later, with Junglee Pictures on board. Coincidentally, by then, the film was also being backed by what I consider my home, Dharma Productions. It felt nice because this was going to be a beautiful collaboration with Vineet Jain (MD, Times Group), Priti Shahani, Dharma, Meghna and I. We set out with a vision to narrate a gritty, true story which everyone can relate to.The fact that it’s a true story will make it relevant whenever it’s told. I also believe that whatever time you choose to tell a good story, it will have the same impact. Whether it’s told today, or it was told in 1971, or even 10 years from now, a story like this will still find its way into people’s hearts. It’s important for people to know what happened. It will stir them emotionally. The trailer, and eventually the film, will be relevant in every country across the world. Everyone feels the same for their motherland. It doesn’t matter which nation you belong to, you will still love your country the way Sehmat loved hers, and I love mine. It’s like the love you feel for a person, which means the same to everyone all over the world. I wish everyone, all over the subcontinent and the world, watches the trailer and the film, because I think everyone will relate with the core emotion in 'Raazi'.Yeah, I have run risks, but if I don’t do that now, when will I do it? I don’t want to live with ‘I could have’ and ‘Maybe I should have’ kind of thoughts. I don’t believe in weighing a film’s box office prospects before giving it my nod. If my instinct says that I should do it, I go ahead. Like I really wanted to be a part of Sehmat’s world because I’ve never narrated a true story. Of course, we all want to do films that do well, but I also have to live my life truly as an actor and for that, I have to pick different characters. In that sense, I am selfish.I have to surprise or challenge myself with the films I do. I know that it won’t happen every time, but I think I am attracted to that little fear, ‘Will I be able to do this?’ That forms the basis of my hunt for roles. Fortunately, that instinct hasn’t failed me on too many occasions and it feels great that whenever I have taken a risk, it has paid off.I learnt about the sheer selflessness of people and the willingness with which they would give up everything for their nation. Look at Sehmat in the trailer. Someone once said to me that there is no such thing as a selfless deed, but I don’t think that is true, especially in this case. I don’t think I could have played a more selfless character than Sehmat. A parent putting a child’s interest before his or hers is a great deal, but to put your country’s interest before everything else is even greater. The line in the trailer, ‘Watan ke aage kuch nahi, khud bhi nahi’ encapsulates a sentiment, which is difficult to emulate on screen.It’s an extensive book because it also talks about Sehmat’s parents, Teji and Hidayat, in great detail. So, I just read the portions, which formed the crux of our film.While working on a film, my director becomes my mother, father, boyfriend and friend. It wasn’t any different on 'Raazi'. Meghna was everything for me and we had an unspoken understanding. We had really cracked something, which was so perfect.Yes, my parents have been very involved with 'Raazi'. My mother ( Soni Razdan ) has even acted in the film. They’ve both seen the trailer. The first time my dad ( Mahesh Bhatt ) saw the trailer, he was sitting a little away from our dining area and watching it intently on his laptop. Suddenly, we heard a whistle. That’s how we knew he’s liked it. Though my mother has acted in the film, she had tears in her eyes when she saw the trailer. She said, ‘It’s very moving and gritty.’'Raazi', presented by Junglee Pictures and Dharma Productions, and produced by Vineet Jain, Karan Johar, Hiroo Yash Johar and Apoorva Mehta , releases on May 11, 2018.","It was something Meghna believed that I should do authentically, and I feel that it helped me get perfectly into the character.

Movie Review: Blackmail: Blackmail Movie Review {4,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/blackmail/articleshow/63609942.cms,"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 05:42:08 GMT","Story: Dev (Irrfan) is a toilet paper salesman. One evening he decides to spice up his otherwise mundane life and passionless marriage, by going home early from work with a bunch of roses for his wife. It turns out, that his wife is in bed with another man. This shocking revelation leads to a series of events which are both funny and outrageous.Review: The middle-class man is a victim of his own circumstances. He lives a life of submission, so much so, that when presented with a situation of conflict, like Dev, he struggles to commit a crime of passion. He resigns to his fate, or so it would seem. Blackmail takes this concept and gives it an uproariously good twist. It takes the common man’s daily dilemmas and puts an intriguing spin on things like EMIs, loans and failing relationships.On learning about his wife’s adultery, Dev starts blackmailing her lover Ranjit (Arunoday Singh), who in turn blackmails Dev’s wife. More drama unfolds once other characters from Dev’s life get to know of his blackmailing plans. It sparks a series of sorts, where everyone starts blackmailing someone else for motive. The situational humour that arises from this madcap premise is hilarious. Parveez Sheikh (who’s written Queen and Bajrangi Bhaijaan) has his finger on the right note, and pitches the comedy in the sequences skilfully.The pace of the first half is a bit slow. It takes time to setup all the plots, but even then, the humour stays crisp and entertaining. The second half is a laughter riot. As each plot unfolds, the situations get bizarrely funny. Abhinay Deo’s direction is on the money. After his black comedy Delhi Belly, he has cracked another one in this genre with Blackmail. The sublime toilet humour in this story reminds you of Delhi Belly. The music in the film (Amit Trivedi) beautifully accentuates the right scenes. Badla, the rap featuring Trivedi and Divine has been used effectively, and it adds great energy to the narrative. In the film, Omi Vaidya who’s back with his crazy American twang keeps encouraging Dev by saying, “shake it up” (pun intended!). Add to that, there’s a zany song called Sataasat with lyrics alluding to literally shaking it off! Blackmail’s quirky humour and presentation makes it a delight ride.Irrfan gives a solid performance as the average office guy who can’t stand up to his boss, nor to his unfaithful wife. He brings an air of helplessness to his character and keeps a straight face even when he’s plotting and planning the blackmail. There’s a degree of uncertainty in his actions which comes from his goodness – and that’s what adds to the hilarity of it all. Arunoday Singh, as the wacky track-suit wearing bad boy, is a rage. It’s one of the best performances of his career. Divya Dutta as Ranjit’s drunken and dominating wife adds to the amusement. Her scenes with Arunoday are engaging. Also Kriti Kulhari, is decent in her part as the philandering wife.The plot of Blackmail is its hero and it manages to strike a good balance between dark and funny. Characters are bumped off, sometimes in most gory detail and strange events unfold, but the film never loses its vein of easy, black humour. This is one of the most wickedly funny films that we’ve seen in a long time.","Blackmail takes this concept and gives it an uproariously good twist.

However, the ‘Wake Up Sid’ actor is low-key when it comes to his friends and maintains a set friend circle in his life.

In an interview with a daily, the actor spoke about the importance of a friend circle and emphasized how important they are, considering the profession. He said that friends keep you grounded, make you humane, and give you a reality check.

Ranbir has often praised his one true friend, Bollywood filmmaker Ayan Mukerji.

Talking about spending quality time with friends, Ranbir reportedly quipped that to unwind, he goes for a drive, watch movies or play football with his mates.

At a recent event, Ranbir candidly spoke about the repercussions of stardom. The actor reportedly averred that stardom isolates one from the world because a lot of people want time and attention. He thinks it is a bit sad because nobody should be isolated in life.

When questioned if stardom has changed him as a person, Ranbir reportedly averred that whether I have changed or not, probably his friends would be the right people to answer this. To him, he is the same person that he was in school and college.

On the work front, Ranbir is geared up to portray Sanjay Dutt in the upcoming untitled biopic, which is scheduled to release on June 29, 2018. In addition, Ranbir will also star opposite Alia Bhatt in Ayan Mukerji’s ‘Brahmastra’.","However, the ‘Wake Up Sid’ actor is low-key when it comes to his friends and maintains a set friend circle in his life.

Saudi Arabia’s archaeological treasure of Al-Ula to open to tourists for the first time,https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/saudi-arabia-s-archaeological-treasure-of-al-ula-to-open-to-tourists-for-the-first-time/story-S4y6YJk7JksU9PevnGP5bI.html,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 01:18:59 GMT","Trudging up a caramel-hued cliff pocked with ancient tombs, guide Bandar al-Anazi gazed at the stunning view: a windswept desert landscape of pre-Islamic ruins at the centre of Saudi-Franco preservation efforts.

Al-Ula, an area rich in archaeological remnants, is seen as a jewel in the crown of future Saudi attractions as the austere kingdom prepares to issue tourist visas for the first time - opening up one of the last frontiers of global tourism.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is set to sign a landmark agreement with Paris on Tuesday for the touristic and cultural development of the northwestern site, once a crossroads of ancient civilisations.

“All of Al-Ula is an open air museum,” Anazi said during a media tour just days before Prince Mohammed’s trip, revealing a patchwork of rock-cut tombs containing niches for burials.

“There is so much history here still waiting to be discovered.”

The tombs, some containing pre-Islamic inscriptions and drawings such as hunting scenes, are a legacy of the Nabataean artistic tradition. The chiseled rock art forms could help unravel the mysteries of millennia-old civilisations on the Arabian Peninsula.

The area, roughly the size of Belgium, served as an important way station and bedouin watering hole on the trade route linking the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa and India. It is home to the kingdom’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site, Madain Saleh, built more than 2,000 years ago by the Nabataeans.

“Every day something new is being discovered,” Jamie Quartermaine, an expert from the Britain-based Oxford Archaeology group, told AFP.

“The potential is endless. Look behind you,” he said, pointing at ancient animal art depictions engraved on a rocky spur inside an Al-Ula hotel resort.

Gift to the world

A helicopter tour of the area revealed a desert landscape that appeared like the top of a foamed latte, dotted with heritage sites and towering maze-like rock formations. The Saudi-Franco partnership is in part aimed at preserving the site from further erosion and vandalism it has faced.

At one archeological site called Al-Khoraiba, Anazi pointed at a bereft cistern. Photos taken by French explorers Jaussen and Savignac, who visited the area in the early 20th century, showed the same cistern once featured the statue of a deity.

The walled city of Al-Ula, with tightly packed mud-brick and stone houses that were inhabited until modern times, sits decaying under the scorching sun. But before a preservation plan is launched in collaboration with France, all archaeological treasures need to be accounted for, said Amr al-Madani, head of the Royal Al-Ula Commission.

A massive two-year surveying programme began in March, which includes scanning via helicopters, satellites, drones and a remote sensing technology called Lidar, he told AFP.

“This is a significant undertaking incorporating all levels of survey from aerial survey down to ground checking,” said Quartermaine.

A Franco-Saudi deal to develop Al-Ula calls for the creation of a dedicated agency modelled on the lines of the French museums agency, which spearheaded the establishment of the Louvre museum in Abu Dhabi. At least one large museum is planned to be built in Al-Ula. Gerard Mestrallet, the former CEO of French electric utility company Engie, has been appointed special envoy of French President Emmanuel Macron for Al-Ula.

Al-Ula is expected to fully open up to global tourists within three to five years, launching the site as what Saudi officials describe as “a gift to the world”.

Pride in our past

Al-Ula is among a hidden trove of Saudi archaeological treasures. Archaeologists last year used Google Maps to find hundreds of stone “gates” built from rock in a remote Saudi desert, which may date back as far as 7,000 years.

They also discovered evidence of 46 lakes believed to have existed in Saudi Arabia’s northern Nefud desert, which experts say has lent credence to the theory that the region swung between periods of desertification and a wetter climate.

Tourism is one of the centrepieces of the blueprint to prepare the biggest Arab economy for the post-oil era. Al-Ula’s hotel infrastructure is currently inadequate, with only two facilities with a capacity of 120 rooms.

But the project is about reviving the glory of Saudi Arabia’s ancient past. There is currently scant information in Saudi history textbooks about Al-Ula.

“This is about national pride in our own past,” Anazi said.

Delhi’s IGI Airport boots out New York’s JFK from world’s top 20 busiest airports,https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/new-york-s-jfk-airport-is-not-longer-listed-as-world-s-top-20-busiest-airports-here-s-why/story-CcM0AlPEhZTpMKvn1iyvYO.html,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 12:43:30 GMT","New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport has jumped six notches to break into the league of the top 20 busiest airports in the world for 2017 in terms of traffic volumes.

The GMR-group-run New Delhi airport jumped from 22nd rank in 2016 to 16th rank, solidifying its status as one of the fastest growing airports in the world for passenger traffic, as per the Airports Council International (ACI).

The ranking is based on the preliminary passenger traffic results for the most-travelled airports in 2017, released by the ACI on Monday.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) was ranked the busiest airport in the world with 103 million passengers (both departing and arriving) despite a 0.3 per cent decline in traffic volumes over 2016.

Founded in 1991 with the objective of fostering cooperation among its member airports and other partners in world aviation, ACI is the trade association of the world’s airports, currently serving 641 members operating from 1,953 airports across 176 countries.

ACI’s World Airport Traffic Forecasts also predicts that the country will represent the third largest aviation market, in terms of passenger throughput, after the US and China by 2020.

“Delhi, the country’s busiest airport for passenger traffic, grew by 14.1 per cent year-over-year at 63.45 million, pushing it up from 22nd to the 16th busiest airport in the world,” the ACI said in the release.

Even with this rapid growth in throughput, Delhi was also ranked first in Airport Service Quality for airports above 40 million passengers per annum along with the Mumbai airport, it said.

Besides, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai were also ranked among the fastest growing airports in the world with an year-over-year growth of 26.9 per cent, 19.6 per cent, 12.9 per cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively during 2017, the ACI said in the release.

Growing rapidly in relatively short period of time, India is poised to be one of the largest aviation markets in the world in the years to come, the ACI said.

“With an astounding population base of over 1.3 billion inhabitants, the move towards a more liberalised aviation market coupled with stronger economic fundamentals has helped to awaken the Bengal tiger to become one of the fastest growing markets in the world,” the ACI said.

Republican Peadar Whelan is one such guide, having spent 16 years behind bars for trying to kill a British policeman in the late 1970s. The 60-year-old now earns a living recalling “The Troubles”.

The conflict broke out in 1969 and only ended with the Good Friday Agreement signed 20 years ago on Tuesday but the wounds are far from healed and there are fears now that looming Brexit could upset the peace. “It was a war here,” said Whelan as he began his tour outside a former school on Falls Road, a majority Catholic street separated from the Protestant community by a “peace wall” -- one of dozens of separation barriers in the province. The brick walls of the now-abandoned building still bear the bullet holes of the Loyalist snipers. Falls Road was the scene of numerous clashes between Catholic Republicans and Protestant Loyalists and the British army had a surveillance post at the top of the nearby Divis Tower.

“Through the tour we’ll hopefully give you a real sense of the way in which the whole kind of military, colonial, occupying objective of the British army... becomes clear,” Whelan said. Arriving at a memorial garden for Republican activists and Irish Republican Army (IRA) fighters, Whelan recalled the “volunteers” who fell during the violence, but whom the other side describes as terrorists. The group of around 10 tourists is then taken to the west of Falls Road, to a large fresco depicting a smiling Bobby Sands, the militant nationalist who died in his cell in 1981 after a 66-day hunger strike.

‘No regrets’

Whelan described the solidarity among Republican prisoners at the time. “I was 19 years of age, hadn’t a clue,” he explained. “After three days of torture and abuse my door opened and this man (Sands) has given me a bag with biscuits and books and newspapers and some fruit,” he added. “Somebody just saying ‘you’re not on your own here’.”

The next stop takes in the peace wall that has separated the Catholics of Falls Road from the Protestants of Shankill Road since 1969. On the other side of the wall, Noel Large continues the tour. He is the same age and has spent the same time in prison as Whelan, but is from the loyalist camp. The tattooed former militant, who joined a banned group aged 17, said he “grew up to fear and be suspicious of Catholics”. As a young man he was involved in murders, attempted murders and robberies. Large was sentenced to four life sentences, totalling 357 years, following his arrest in 1982. But he was finally released in 1998 as part of the Good Friday agreement that brought an official end to the violence. “What I did didn’t change anything, it made things worse,” said Large, now a grandfather.

By contrast, Whelan claimed to have “no regrets”. “I am who I am, I was who I was,” he added. The diametrically opposed paths of the two men converged little-by-little as the violence subsided. Today they both practise their storytelling skills, taking visitors to neighbourhoods they know by heart. But Whelan does not see the “peace walls” disappearing any time soon, believing that even though “the war is over”, people remain worried about the return of violence. “At some point, the walls will go but when... who knows?” he said.

Large agreed, saying: “It’s going to take a couple of generations for people to move beyond and stop thinking of the Troubles”. One major concern is Brexit, with the future of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland a key sticking point that some fear could reignite tensions. “Brexit is the elephant in the room,” said Large. “We don’t know what the implications are. “No-one wants the return of a hard border,” he added.

Hungary is not just a party paradise. Here are 5 fun things to know about the European country,https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/hungary-is-not-just-a-party-paradise-here-are-5-fun-things-to-know-about-the-european-country/story-5w1LwUPJXVLJeZvx1PjfZP.html,"Mon, 09 Apr 2018 11:04:59 GMT","Aside from its politics, nightlife — and its goulash, of course — many may not know that Hungary is home to the man who discovered Vitamin C and a type of pig that looks like a sheep. Here are five things to know about the central European country:

The good old days

Nostalgia is everywhere in Hungary, whether it be harking back to the glorious exploits of the Magical Magyars football team under captain Ferenc Puskas, to the days of Greater Hungary, when the country was three times its current size, or even to the era of communist dictator Janos Kadar. The rich past that fills Hungarians with pride sometimes also colours political life. Hungarian leaders, in particular Prime Minister Viktor Orban, like to paint themselves as the “defenders of Europe”, an allusion to interminable clashes with Ottoman forces such as the siege of Nandorfehervar (modern-day Belgrade) in 1456. Janos Hunyadi’s victory in that battle still resonates in Hungary today.

Then there is Attila the Hun. Although the link between Huns and Hungarians is still debated, the conqueror of the steppes still inspires countless myths, particularly in nationalist circles.

Budapest, party capital

Far from the sweeping plains that the mangalica call home, the Hungarian capital has in recent years become one of Europe’s hotspots for rowdy tourists on a budget, lured by dozens of low-cost flights, pints of beer for 1.50 euros ($1.80) and flats to let for 30 euros a night. The city’s historic Jewish quarter is now home to nearly 800 bars, nightclubs and restaurants packed into less than two square kilometres. But just as in Barcelona, Berlin and Amsterdam, residents are growing increasingly fed up of living amongst it all.

Lake Balaton and the ‘sheep-pig’

Hungary’s premier natural attraction is the opaline Lake Balaton, central Europe’s largest at 600 square kilometres (230 square miles), whose shallow waters guarantee warm swimming for the holidaymakers who flock to its shores every summer. In the past, they included many German families split by the East-West divide, as Hungary was relatively easy for nationals of both sides to visit. The hidden treasure among Hungary’s fauna meanwhile is undoubtedly the mangalica, a breed of pig covered in thick sheep-like wool. Its delicious marbled meat, high in fat content, is prized by connoisseurs around the world.

Hungarian ingenuity

The modern world has a lot to thank the Hungarians for, whether it’s Laszlo Biro, who gave his name to the ubiquitous ballpoint pen; Janos Irinyi, who invented the non-explosive match; or Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, credited with discovering Vitamin C. And the man who oversaw the creation of the Microsoft Word and Excel computer programmes is none other than Charles Simonyi, born Karoly Simonyi in Budapest in 1948. But the Hungarian invention that’s taken up most of the world’s time is probably Erno Rubik’s eponymous cube, millions of which have been sold across the world and which celebrated its 40th birthday in 2014.

Tongue twister

Spot the odd one out: aeroport, airport, aeropuerto, repuloter... Similarly, fussball, futbol and futebol are all easy enough to guess in other countries, but labdarugas for the beautiful game? Hungarian is undoubtedly one of Europe’s toughest languages for outsiders to learn, as it is totally unrelated to any of its neighbours, has a 42-letter alphabet as well as 35 verb endings and a bewildering array of noun cases. One word it has adopted though, usefully enough, is “Hello!”

"First luxury hotel in space to open in 2022; one night stay costs $792,000",https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/first-luxury-hotel-in-space-to-open-in-2022-one-night-stay-costs-792-000/story-8NmEwN3FJRaeu3N1tvqbPP.html,"Mon, 09 Apr 2018 06:54:40 GMT","Aboard the International Space Station, an astronaut’s life is typically work, exercise, rest, repeat. But what if your chance of having the right stuff for NASA’s astronaut corps is, to say the least, minimal?

Aurora Station, billed as the “first luxury hotel in space,” may be for you. Houston-based Orion Span Inc. hopes to launch the modular station in late 2021 and welcome its first guests the following year, with two crew members accompanying each excursion. The platform would orbit 200 miles above Earth, offering six guests 384 sunrises and sunsets as they race around the planet for 12 days at incredibly high speeds.

Once, such a thing would have clearly been the stuff of fiction. Now, in the age of SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic, the idea that a private company would launch an orbiting hotel seems almost pedestrian.

“We want to get people into space because it’s the final frontier for our civilization,” said Orion Span’s founder and chief executive officer, Frank Bunger, a former software engineer. Orion Span’s offering won’t be for everyone, however: Launch and re-entry are not for the faint of heart.

“We’re not selling a hey-let’s-go-to-the-beach equivalent in space,” Bunger said. “We’re selling the experience of being an astronaut. You reckon that there are people who are willing to pay to have that experience.”

Beyond the physical limitations to embarking, there are also the fiscal ones.

The 12-day stay starts at $9.5 million per person, or about $791,666 (Rs 5.14 crore) a night. Aurora Station is planned as a 35-by-14-foot module, or roughly the interior volume of a Gulfstream G550 private jet, according to Bunger. The station would accommodate as many as four guests, plus the two crew. The company requires an $80,000 deposit, which is fully refundable, and began accepting payments on April 5.

Orion Span is assessing potential funding sources to get the endeavour off the ground, but won’t disclose how much it wants to raise for the project, a spokeswoman said. It reflects the type of commercial venture that’s become more common over the past decade, fuelled by decreases in launch costs and an influx of venture capital. Since 2015, startup space companies have attracted $7.9 billion in investment, according to Bryce Space & Technology LLC, a consulting firm.

“The commercialisation of LEO (low Earth orbit) is an exciting prospect, but it will be an exercise in determining what ideas are more real than others,” said Phil Larson, a former space policy adviser to President Barack Obama who worked for Elon Musk’s SpaceX, or Space Exploration Technologies Corp. He is now assistant dean and chief of staff at the University of Colorado at Boulder’s College of Engineering and Applied Science.

Orion Span has yet to contract with a launch provider, either for its initial flights to build the station or for customer flights. The startup’s aggressive four-year time frame may be a ploy, Larson said, to assess “what kind of market might be out there for this.” Van Espahbodi, managing partner of Starburst Accelerator LLC, a consulting and venture firm, added that the public-relations push behind Orion Span may be an effective way to help the company attract funding, too.

Orion Span’s chief architect and operating and chief technical officers are former NASA employees. The company said it’s “developed proprietary technology to drive a full order of magnitude of cost out of the design and manufacture of a space station.” Bunger said the firm’s designs would work with most of the current launch configurations, such as Arianespace, SpaceX, and United Launch Alliance. It could also partner with a government space agency, he said.

One reason Orion Span can target a price of less than $10 million per person is because of declining launch prices, Bunger said in an interview. “Everybody’s forecasting that they’re going to fall,” he said. “Almost every week there’s another rocket launch company that’s starting up with a new way to get to orbit cheaper, faster, better.”

Indeed, Orion Span joins a growing list of entrepreneurial firms that see cheaper access to space leading to a demand for more real estate in low Earth orbit. Bigelow Aerospace LLC, founded by lodging billionaire Robert Bigelow, deployed its 8-foot, 3,000-pound inflatable activity module on the ISS in May 2016. In October, NASA extended the two-year service period for the module—which is used for storage—to remain part of the space station until at least 2021.

Axiom Space LLC, a Houston-based company also run by NASA veterans, said it plans to launch habitation modules to complement the ISS. Arizona-based World View Enterprises Inc. is developing a fleet of high-altitude platforms, called stratollites, carried by balloons to the edge of space. The stratollites are used for communications, surveillance, weather forecasting, atmospheric research, and other applications. Last week, World View said it had raised a total of $48.5 million.

But the new world of commercial spaceflight has yet to launch a human into space, let alone civilians and leave them there for two weeks. Prior to launch, Aurora Station travellers would have three months of training, beginning with online courses to understand “basic spaceflight, orbital mechanics, and pressurized environments in space.” Hotel guests will also have required exercises on spacecraft systems and contingency training at the company’s Houston facility.

Looking for an offbeat place to visit? Here’s why you should add Azerbaijan to your travel bucket list,https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/looking-for-an-offbeat-place-to-visit-here-s-why-you-should-add-azerbaijan-to-your-travel-bucket-list/story-BKs9qWqB5jyqVapRfpuRhI.html,"Mon, 09 Apr 2018 06:30:14 GMT","Azerbaijan has a rich history and culture, and boasts of many natural wonders and musical traditions. Here are five things you should know about the Caspian Sea nation:

The land of fire

Due to the abundance of natural flames coming from the energy-rich nation’s huge underground gas deposits, Azerbaijanis often call their country “The Land of Fire”. The expression is rooted in Zoroastrianism, a fire-worshipping religion that dominated the territory of modern-day Azerbaijan before it adopted Shia Islam. The pentagonal castle-like Baku Temple of Fire had an altar with eternal fire that was fed by underground gas coming to surface and lit up due to the contact with oxygen. A red flame features at the centrepiece of Azerbaijan’s state emblem.

Azokh cave

One of the country’s most important landmarks, the imposing Azix Magarasi six-cave complex, is located on the territory of Nagorny Karabakh, which has been under Armenian control since it was seized during a bloody conflict in the early 1990s after the break-up of the Soviet Union. The labyrinthine limestone caves adorned with stalactites and stalagmites are considered by archaeologists to be one of the oldest living sites of prehistoric humans in Eurasia, dating back 1.5 million years.

Intangible heritage

A complex art form blending traditional Azerbaijani musical improvisation and classical poetry, Mugham reflects different periods of Azerbaijan’s history and its contacts with other Turkic peoples, as well as Persians, Armenians, and Georgians. Cultivated by members of the Sufi orders and by performers of religious dramas, the genre features a male or female singer accompanied by musicians playing traditional instruments, such as a long-neck lute, a four-string spiked fiddle, and a large tambourine. A short selection of Azerbaijani Mugham was in 1977 included on the Voyager Golden Record attached to the Voyager spacecraft to represent world music.

National animal

Azerbaijan’s national animal, the Karabakh horse, is a mountain-steppe racing and riding breed noted for its speed, intelligence and red-golden colour. Thanks to their suppleness, the Karabakhs are ideal mount for Azerbaijan’s national sport, chovgan, a polo-like horse-riding game played on a flat, grassy field by two competing teams. One of the world’s oldest, the breed currently numbers below 1,000 and is threatened with extinction.

Dynastic rule

According to the Azerbaijani constitution, the country is a democratic republic, but in fact it is for over three decades ruled with an iron fist by uncrowned monarchs — a family which, critics say, has crushed the opposition and used their power to amass a fortune that funds its lavish lifestyle. Current president Ilham Aliyev, succeeded in 2003 his father Heydar, the former Communist leader of the ex-Soviet republic. Cementing his family’s grip on power, Ilham Aliyev last year appointed his wife Mehriban Aliyeva as first vice president — after having awarded her with the country’s highest honour, the Order of... Heydar Aliyev.

Beyond the iconic red and yellow of the surf-lifesavers and miles of world-class sandy beaches, the Gold Coast is a city bursting with innovative people and ideas.

Here are just a few:

Very virtual: What started as an educational project to help save the Great Barrier Reef has grown into a virtual tour of the world’s deep blue. Welcome to Google Ocean Street View, which allows users to explore some of the oceans that cover 70% of the Earth’s surface — all without putting on a bathing suit. The underwater footage gives viewers a 360-degree look at dolphins, coral nurseries and even shipwrecks — and people love the images so much the company behind the imagery has received more than 600 million online hits.

And that company, Panedia, is on the Gold Coast. Aaron Spence started it in 2006 and six years ago he brought in Carlos Chegado, an expert in virtual reality photography. Spence worked with Chegado in developing underwater rigs and lenses that could withstand ocean pressure and be used for 360-degree photography and videography underwater.

“This is the most ambitious aquatic project in the world ... and it is exciting for me to be part of a project that is so important for all of humanity,” Chegado said. “The ocean is the earth’s life support system but it is changing at a rapid rate due to climate change, pollution and over fishing. “But we also want to celebrate the beauty of what do have so we are also filming 50 of the world’s most beautiful reefs — and we are putting this imagery up on 50reefs.org.”

The team uses six cameras capturing 6,000 images a day and there are more than 40 Google Ocean Street View locations around the world.

Bring back the weekend ☹ A post shared by Mark (@mb_auz) on Apr 8, 2018 at 3:35am PDT

Location, location: Forget Chris Hemsworth. The Gold Coast’s biggest mover and shaker in the movie industry could very well be location manager Duncan Jones. While he doesn’t play a super hero, Jones has transformed streets and beaches, parks and buildings into sets for the movies such as Thor, Aquaman and even Captain Jack Sparrow.

The 44-year-old Jones started as a dolphin trainer at the Sea World theme park on the Gold Coast, where he worked on the set of TV series Flipper — and fell into the movie business. “The Gold Coast has it all — from beaches that could be Rio through to rainforest that could be the Amazon jungle — and our weather is a definite bonus when it comes to shooting in outdoor locations,” Jones said.

The Gold Coast is undoubtedly the driving force behind Australia’s movie industry, the city has recently played host to Thor: Ragnarok, Unbroken, San Andreas, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. But it was the construction of a permanent large-scale outdoor water tank that was used in the U.S. production of Fool’s Gold in 2007, and starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey, that really put the Gold Coast on Hollywood’s radar. The tank allowed for large-scale underwater and above water filming and is directly responsible for attracting 10 big productions.

A Gold Coast company is lighting up the gaming floors of casinos around the world. Simtech Creations counts the world’s largest casino — the Venetian in Macau — as a client as well as Las Vegas Venetian and Galaxy, and Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands casino and Sentosa Island.

While Simtech, which turns over between $30-40 million annually, does work for all the Australian casinos, managing director John Curtis said this accounted for only five percent of its business. “Globally we are the biggest gambling supplier in the world in terms of displays and link systems,” Curtis said.

Curtis said his company’s LED lighting technology, which can be contoured to virtually any shape, is 10 years ahead of its international competitors and such is the demand that Simtech has expanded to 13 small factories.

Their lighting technology, which can flow around corners and curves and often highlights gaming machines and tables, is now used in casinos in Asia, America, Philippines, Australia and New Zealand.

"Forget Sydney, Auckland is becoming a global dining powerhouse",https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/forget-sydney-auckland-is-becoming-a-global-dining-powerhouse/story-oNlNRtRfnpihbC34sjQliL.html,"Sun, 08 Apr 2018 06:59:49 GMT","If there’s one thing most people know about Auckland, it’s that New Zealand’s largest city has astounding natural beauty. Rather than thinking of it as a progressive cultural hub, people envision the glistening harbors, lush green mountains, and untouched islands just off its coastline. But Auckland has become one of the most innovative culinary destinations in the South Pacific- rivaling even Sydney and Melbourne.

Case in point: At Orphan’s Kitchen, a sparse dining room in the trendy Ponsonby district, the chef, Tom Hishon, whips up wood-roasted chook (chicken) with kiwi mole and pillowy, purple tortillas made from kumara, a local variety of sweet potato. The chef’s manifesto references Maori heritage and New Zealand’s erratic weather; guests are encouraged to watch the sunset from an outdoor courtyard, and there are beehives on the second floor. Occasionally, breakfast features tasting menus.

Any Aucklander will admit that this was unthinkable not long ago. When I was growing up here in the ‘90s to early aughts, the restaurant options were limited to conventional white tablecloth spots, where most tables got birthday candles in their chocolate sponge cake. Now the city is flourishing with stylish cafes-turned-hangouts, glossy restaurants, boutique dessert bars, and lively marketplaces.

“Auckland attracts more than 2.6 million international visitors each year, and tourist numbers have grown almost 8 % annually over the last five years—with no signs of slowing,” explains Steven Armitage of Auckland Tourism. With factors such as Zika virus and intensifying political instability around the world sending travelers on a search for untapped safe havens, New Zealand has emerged as a trending option. The restaurant boom couldn’t have come at a better time.

Slow beginnings

Auckland’s slow culinary transformation began after the city hosted the America’s Cup back in 2000, prompting the redevelopment of the downtown Viaduct area into a mixed-use social hub. In came a series of creative restaurateurs, eager to translate the region’s natural resources into simple yet sophisticated dishes. Ingredients such as locally caught octopus and kumara went from being relatively unfamiliar to stars on the plate.

“The Viaduct was Auckland’s first real hospitality precinct,” says Nicola Waldren, general manager of the Restaurant Association of New Zealand. Almost two decades later, there’s been a domino effect of creativity, she says, spilling from the Viaduct to such new areas as Ponsonby and Britomart, a bustling enclave in the formerly rundown lower central business district. Anywhere you go in town, you’re likely to encounter an establishment that’s as creative—or aspiring to be as creative—as Orphan’s Kitchen.

A familiar story, with a big advantage

At the heart of Auckland’s culinary revolution is Jackie Grant, co-founder of culinary empire Hipgroup, which blends the heirloom ethos of New York’s Dan Barber (of Blue Hill at Stone Barns fame) with a portfolio of essential-feeling establishments reminiscent of Danny Meyer’s oeuvre. Her first restaurant, Café on Kohi, opened in 2004 with an all-day farm-to-table concept that was radical at the time; her latest innovation is Amano, a nose-to-tail Italian restaurant featuring unconventional cuts of locally farmed meats.

“We celebrate fresh, seasonal, local produce sourced from our own farm in Kumeu and pride ourselves in serving ingredients of the highest quality,” Grant explains—which is to say: the same thing most any top-notch establishment is doing the world over.

But where Auckland restaurateurs have a leg up is how these modern foodie tropes are realized: It’s easier to be “local” and “seasonal” when you have a compact country spanning distinct climate zones and growing regions, from sub-tropic to high-altitude mountains, fertile volcanic soil, epic pasture land, and unpolluted waters for fishing. Whereas other city chefs have their locavore goals limited by geography, Auckland’s are elevated by it, able to draw on a bounty of ingredients, both familiar and new, and reconfigure them into a sublime sense of place.

At Amano, that means tortellini with fennel soffrito, stuffed with crayfish from the Wairarapa Coast. At all-day dining spot Rosie, it’s ash-rolled venison with cocoa nib and tomato paste. At Ostro, a glass-walled dining room right on the water, it’s lobster-and-snapper pie, or Wakanui beef with roasted eggplant.

“When we opened our first café in 2004, our industry was still finding its feet and an identity,” says Grant. “We’re proud of what we have here and have reached a point where we know how to showcase it.”

“It’s a very experimental but exciting time here right now in New Zealand,” says Orphan’s Kitchen chef Tom Hishon.

A new wave

If Auckland’s food scene was slow to build, it’s currently evolving at a rapid-fire pace. Prominent chefs are applying their firebrand, Kiwi-proud creativity to everything from bistros to coffee bars to food markets.

Take Ponsonby Central, a multi-venue concept akin to New York’s Chelsea Market, where you can get ethically grown, locally roasted espressos from Eighthirty, shop for grain-fed New Zealand-raised wagyu from a butcher with its own aging room, or snack on the first pizzas in the country to get a seal of approval from the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana.

“The beauty about being in this region is that there are very few rules or any deep culinary history that needs to be adhered to,” explains Nic Watt, chef of Masu in the CBD. “This allows us restaurateurs and chefs a blank canvas to showcase our individuality.” In his case, that means fusing Auckland’s abundant natural resources with Japanese robata grilling.

The momentum shows no signs of slowing. The city is gearing up to host the America’s Cup for the second time in 2021, meaning that several new hospitality developments are already underway. Both the CBD’s International Convention Centre and Commercial Bay—a massive, mixed-use development on the harbor—are set to include outlets from some of the city’s most prominent chefs when they open in 2019. And major luxury hotel brands Park Hyatt and Sofitel SO are opening properties ahead of the big event, filling the city’s void for five-star accommodations and undoubtedly bringing more big-name restaurants to the flourishing CBD area.

Where to eat and sleep in Auckland

Apartment No. 305: Think of it as a luxe Airbnb in picturesque Viaduct Harbor, but with the services of a five-star hotel—such as on-demand meals from ex-Noma chef Finn Gybel.

SkyCity Grand: A modern hotel in the heart of the CBD, within a stone’s throw of the restaurant-packed Federal Street dining strip.

Depot: One of New Zealand’s leading chefs, Al Brown, is behind this inner-city stalwart, which draws Aucklanders far and wide for its fresh-from-the-ocean oysters. They’re bigger and juicier than any you’ve seen.

Ostro: Prominent Kiwi chef Josh Emett has a knack for all things seafood. Be sure to get a pre-dinner drink at the rooftop cocktail bar, Seven; it has great views of Waitemata Harbor.

Masu: The city’s best Japanese robata restaurant, set along Federal Street’s lively restaurant row.

Milse: A Hipgroup venue that offers the city’s best desserts. Don’t miss the passionfruit and thyme gelato cakes.

Joy rides in 150-year-old steam locos to be a reality by next year,https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/joy-rides-in-150-year-old-steam-locos-to-be-a-reality-by-next-year/story-Co6FQnxzqZNd9RZoGgBiYO.html,"Sun, 08 Apr 2018 05:48:03 GMT","Joy rides in 150-year-old heritage steam locos could be a reality for tourists here by next year as the National Rail Museum is restoring three such locos, the oldest dating back to 1865. The Phoenix is a 1920 loco, RamGoti dates back to 1865 and Fireless Locomotive to 1951. All three are being restored by a group of experts and would be made available for tourist use after a feasibility test.

“We are restoring them for tourism purposes. The first one to be ready by this year end is the Fireless loco and is likely to be in the NRM for tourist use,” NRM Director, Amit Saurastri told PTI. The other two locos would be ready by next year, the director said.

The Ministry of Railways is actively working to boost tourism in its network and to showcase its more than 160 years of history. Each loco, an official said, has a unique history. While the Phoenix loco was last used at Jamalpur in Bihar for shunting purposes, RamGoti was used by the municipality in Kolkata for garbage disposal, they said.

Fireless loco was called so as it had no boiler and instead there was a pressure vessel mounted on the under-frame. The steam was collected in the pressure vessel from a static boiler. It was used for shunting in areas of inflammable material such as oil, jute etc. Due to the limited capacity of the steam accumulator, this locomotive had limited speed (18.5 mph) and was limited to short area movements.

This locomotive was last used in Sindhri Fertilizers, Jharkhand. The official said that the restoration of such locos take time as most of their parts are obsolete and thus difficult to find. Currently, tourists can take rides on the steam loco toy train every Sunday and the Patiala State Monorail, a loco dating back to 1907, every Thursday at the museum.

Too many vacation photos on your phone? These apps and hacks will help you manage,https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/too-many-vacation-photos-on-your-phone-these-apps-and-hacks-will-help-you-manage/story-QlfmWR1fqUu11KdusnJHnL.html,"Sun, 08 Apr 2018 03:31:08 GMT","The day the camera roll on my phone hit 50,000 images, I knew I had a problem. I, like so many people I know, take way too many pictures. If I took the time to properly sort and organise them, I could tell you whether or not I have more than 5,000 photos of my Bernese Mountain Dog (my guess is yes), or whether I’ve photographed the sun setting behind One World Trade from my Brooklyn, N.Y., living room on more than 100 separate occasions (my hope is no).

And that’s saying nothing of my endless reel of travel snaps, which obsessively document everything from rooftop bars to intricate mosaic floors to random room service receipts. (Call it a hazard of the job.) I may be unique in the extent of my compulsive photo-taking habit, but I know I’m not alone in struggling to manage the thousands of shots I take each year. A study from the data scientists at InfoTrends shows that globally, people take more than 1.2 trillion images per year, a number that has been rising by 100 billion annually since the debut of the iPhone5. Vacation photos, no doubt, make up a big chunk of that sum.

With that in mind, here are the biggest pain points of a sprawling camera roll and how to best manage them. They’re solutions that I’ve started to integrate into my own life—and, though any solution requires commitment when your mountain of mementos is as big as mine, I can promise that they’re all easy, user-friendly, and well worth an occasional investment of time.

I can’t find the photos I’m looking for!

The native apps on both iPhone and Android, Photos and Google Photos, do a stand-up job of making your photo catalog searchable. Apple’s best feature plots your images on a map of the world so you can search by “place,” which is helpful for itinerants such as myself. It lets me see multiple Paris trips in one folder, for instance, rather than scrolling chronologically through several visits to find the one picture of the Trocadero gardens in bloom.

But I far prefer Google’s search function, which lets you search images by keywords that can range from “Eiffel Tower” to “flowers” to the name of your partner or best friend. It’s not perfect, but it comes close, thanks to an AI platform that blends facial recognition and GPS data. (Android users can’t download the Apple Photos app, but Google Photos is available across all platforms.)

A services such as Adobe Lightroom Premium ($4.99 per month) take the Google search terms one step further. It lets you add customized tags and metadata of your own choosing to the apps’ automatically assigned keyword tags. If you want to sort images into separate folders for African landscapes, African sunsets, African elephants, and Asian elephants, for instance, you can do so with a click of the “add to” button, which lets you access all the folders you’ve already created, or quickly add new ones. A free alternative is SmugMug, which doesn’t attempt to sort your photos for you, but it does offer one of the easiest-to-use interfaces for cataloguing your images. If you’re working with large batches of vacation photos, the app conveniently lets you select entire days’ worth of images at once and move them wholesale into new or existing albums.

I’m running out of storage!

If you use your mobile camera to take pictures of to-do lists and stay on top of loose receipts, as I do, you’re likely to end up with a lot of extraneous junk taking up your precious storage space.

A new solution on Google Photos allows you to archive such items (just look for the option on the left-hand drop-down menu on the app’s home page). And once photos are stored safely in the cloud, you can take them off your local storage by selecting “Free up space” from the same menu—another recent enhancement.

For those with traditional cameras and SD cards, external hard drives can be a life saver—if you choose the right one. The WD My Passport Wireless Pro drive (from $150) has up to 4TB of storage space, and offers nearly instantaneous backup when you pop your SD card into the corresponding slot. Thanks to built-in Wi-Fi, the images can also get synced to a proprietary cloud storage app for quick mobile access and social sharing. And, as the name implies, the whole thing is barely larger than your actual passport, making it easy to tote around in a carry-on.

There’s too much clutter in my camera roll!

Right there with you. My husband loves to make fun of me for taking every photo five or six times. That’s where Zyl comes in. The app recognizes duplicate images and automatically pinpoints the straightest, sharpest, best-lit shot in the bunch. Each set of images shows up on a unique “card” with a green-starred recommendation for the image to keep; simply press “delete” to get rid of the rest.

… But I’m nervous about deleting images!

Try Slidebox instead. The app lets you scroll through recent images the way you might scroll through eligible partners on Tinder. Swipe left and right to navigate through your files, and swipe up when you want to put a photo on the chopping block. It’ll live in a separate folder, in purgatory, until you decide whether you can truly live without it.

An additional option: Use the “favourites” folder on Apple Photos. Whenever you hit the “heart” button in the app’s bottom toolbar, it automatically adds the photo you’re looking at to an album called “Favourites.”

It’s my go-to source when I’m mining memory lane for a Throwback Thursday Instagram shot.

I never actually look at my photos!

It’s time to get them off your phone and into your hands. There’s a wide variety of apps to help in this regard, but our hands-down favorite is AU Mobile, an app by the photo printing studio Artifact Uprising. It lets you transform your snaps into especially luxurious-feeling products: hard-covered albums with titles embossed in gold, calendar pages propped on a brass easel, or prints in minimalist frames, to name a few. And for more everyday sharing, it also lets you create one-off prints to gift to family and friends, all on high-quality, post-consumer-waste paper.

If you want to spend as little time as possible choosing images and layouts, though, Google Photos creates fully automated photo books that get mailed to your front door. It’s literally four clicks from the app’s home page to check out: Hit “assistant,” then “photo book,” and select the trip you want to turn into an album. The book’s pages will get pre-populated with images that Google has deemed to be of high enough quality or that you’ve shown an interest in previously—either by editing or sharing them on social channels. (You can tweak them as you wish.) All that’s left for you to do is choose between a soft or hard cover before clicking the shopping cart button.

I really just want one app to manage everything.

If you’re really only going to take one thing away from this, let it be that Google Photos is a surprisingly adept tool. Don’t get me wrong, the app has some key flaws: I always wish it would let me “favorite” photos for easy retrieval, the way Apple does, or that I could easily commission prints of single images with the tap of a button.

That aside, it’s the most versatile photo app on the market today. It’s highly searchable, automatically backs up to the cloud (often for free, or very close to it), and is loaded with AI features that help you make the most of your gallery.","I can’t find the photos I’m looking for!

"Sometimes, life is just a walk in the park…",https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/sometimes-life-is-just-a-walk-in-the-park/story-UdEQsofjIO5Ql2SX3PR5yH.html,"Sat, 07 Apr 2018 04:39:30 GMT","Spring is always the best time to take a walk in Delhi’s Lodi Gardens. The flowers are blooming, the trees are alive, the grass is greener than ever, and the birdsong is enough to make your heart soar. This spring though, as I walked briskly down its little winding roads, I realised that while I hadn’t been looking Lodi Gardens had turned in to a photography studio rather than the neighbourhood park I remembered it as.

To be fair, over the years, you could always find the odd couple posing for their engagement/wedding photos, looking self-conscious and embarrassed in all their finery amidst the joggers in their track pants and T-shirts. But this was something entirely different.

As I entered through the Ashoka Gate, the first thing I saw was a heavily-pregnant lady, wearing a maroon empire-line maxi-dress, posing in silhouette against one of the many monuments Lodi Gardens is littered with. Kneeling in front of her was a man who I presumed was her husband, his hand placed proprietorially on her baby bump. Immortalising this moment for posterity (and for the progeny) was a burly bearded photographer wielding a DSLR camera like it was an offensive weapon, while his two assistants held up sheets of white thermocol at different angles to provide the best light.

I smiled indulgently at this tableau and moved on. I couldn’t have gone more than thirty paces when yet another photography session caught my eye. This time it was a couple who looked to be in their early 30s, accompanied by a whole team of hair and make-up people, who had opened their little suitcase of products and were conducting urgent repairs on the principals. Once the touch-up was done, one of the photographer’s assistants handed the couple a golden balloon in the shape of the number one. They hoisted it up between them, smiled widely and said ‘cheese’ to celebrate what I can only hope was their first anniversary.

Fifty yards on, another love story was being memorialised on camera. This time, it was clearly a proposal, or rather, the re-enacting of one. The boy was in the now-mandatory position of being down on one knee, holding up a ring box in his right hand, while he held out his left arm in what can only be described as a Shah Rukh Khan pose. The girl was doing her best Sushmita-Sen-wins-Miss-Universe impression, holding her hands to her mouth in mock-shock and faux-awe. They held this pose for absolute ages as the photographer captured it from every conceivable angle. Given how much effort they had put into the ‘proposal’ I was sure that their marriage would be the stuff of legend.

And thus it went, photo session after photo session, as I tried my best to meet my target of 10,000 steps. And not just that day either; this was pretty much par for the course every single time I went for a walk in Lodi Gardens.

As I trudged along, I tried to figure out what accounted for this sudden urge for ordinary, middle-class folk to conduct ‘glam shoots’ to commemorate some moment or the other. And then, it suddenly hit me: Instagram!

Everyone knows that when it comes to Instagram, you have to look your very best, and the photo has to be of professional quality

That’s where all these photos were headed; to be posted on ‘Insta’ with a plethora of hashtags for their family and friends to ‘like’ and comment on. And everyone knows that when it comes to Instagram, you have to look your very best, the photo has to be professional quality, so why not hire experts to do the job? Sure, it can’t be cheap. But hey, a good photo will live on forever on Insta; and who knows, if it is striking enough, it may even go viral!

I guess this was bound to happen one day. A movement that began with everybody taking pictures of their breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the odd fancy meal at an expensive restaurant was bound to end up with heavily-curated pictures of seminal moments of our lives, all subtly highlighted and posted on Insta with a suitable filter (X-pro or Lo-fi, anyone?). After all, if you post innumerable photos showing off the beautiful locations of your summer/winter vacations, then how can you ignore important milestones like proposals, anniversaries, pregnancies, etc.? And surely, such landmark moments rate more than the usual ‘selfies’ (even if they are taken with a selfie-stick). No, you need to call in the professionals at such times.

So, I guess that’s why my favourite neighbourhood spot for long, lonely walks has been transformed into Photography Central. There are more glittery stilettos in evidence than sturdy running shoes. There are more shiny dresses around than there are jogging pants. And there are more hair and make-up people around than actual exercise enthusiasts.

And you know what? I love it!

I love watching those young lovers making gooey eyes at one another. I love seeing the look of pride in a young man’s eyes as he cradles his wife’s pregnant belly. And, of course, I love the corny proposal scenarios that play out every day in front of me.

I don’t know how much these photography sessions cost (and I, for one, would never pay good money for them). But I do know that for sheer entertainment value alone, they are priceless.

A Space Odyssey: This new luxury hotel in space is the ultimate travel destination,https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/a-space-odyssey-this-new-luxury-hotel-in-space-is-the-ultimate-travel-destination/story-0XdL91jtxmTJul0riBqUdM.html,"Sat, 07 Apr 2018 09:54:19 GMT","Aboard the International Space Station, an astronaut’s life is typically work, exercise, rest, repeat. But what if your chance of having the right stuff for NASA’s astronaut corps is, to say the least, minimal?

Aurora Station, billed as the “first luxury hotel in space,” may be for you. Houston-based Orion Span Inc. hopes to launch the modular station in late 2021 and welcome its first guests the following year, with two crew members accompanying each excursion. The platform would orbit 200 miles above Earth, offering six guests 384 sunrises and sunsets as they race around the planet for 12 days at incredibly high speeds.

Once, such a thing would have clearly been the stuff of fiction. Now, in the age of SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic, the idea that a private company would launch an orbiting hotel seems almost pedestrian. “We want to get people into space because it’s the final frontier for our civilisation,” said Orion Span’s founder and chief executive officer, Frank Bunger, a former software engineer. Orion Span’s offering won’t be for everyone, however: Launch and re-entry are not for the faint of heart.

“We’re not selling a hey-let’s-go-to-the-beach equivalent in space,” Bunger said. “We’re selling the experience of being an astronaut. You reckon that there are people who are willing to pay to have that experience.” Beyond the physical limitations to embarking, there are also the fiscal ones.

The 12-day stay starts at $9.5 million per person, or about $791,666 (Rs 5,13,94,956) a night. Aurora Station is planned as a 35-by-14-foot module, or roughly the interior volume of a Gulfstream G550 private jet, according to Bunger. The station would accommodate as many as four guests, plus the two crew. The company requires an $80,000 deposit, which is fully refundable, and began accepting payments on Thursday.

Orion Span is assessing potential funding sources to get the endeavour off the ground, but won’t disclose how much it wants to raise for the project, a spokeswoman said. It reflects the type of commercial venture that’s become more common over the past decade, fuelled by decreases in launch costs and an influx of venture capital. Since 2015, startup space companies have attracted $7.9 billion in investment, according to Bryce Space & Technology LLC, a consulting firm.

“The commercialization of LEO (low Earth orbit) is an exciting prospect, but it will be an exercise in determining what ideas are more real than others,” said Phil Larson, a former space policy adviser to President Barack Obama who worked for Elon Musk’s SpaceX, or Space Exploration Technologies Corp. He is now assistant dean and chief of staff at the University of Colorado at Boulder’s College of Engineering and Applied Science.

Orion Span has yet to contract with a launch provider, either for its initial flights to build the station or for customer flights. The startup’s aggressive four-year time frame may be a ploy, Larson said, to assess “what kind of market might be out there for this.” Van Espahbodi, managing partner of Starburst Accelerator LLC, a consulting and venture firm, added that the public-relations push behind Orion Span may be an effective way to help the company attract funding, too.

Nairobi, Kenya

If you’re going out on a weekday …

Nairobi National Park. (Shutterstock)

Head to Nairobi National Park, the rare wildlife reserve you can visit by taxi, to see some of the more than 100 mammal species that reside there, including the rare black rhinoceros. After catching a legendary African sunset surrounded by Mother Nature’s riches, have dinner at Talisman, where the service is excellent and the menu blends European, Asian, and African influences. It includes vegetable samosas, grilled fish, spicy Indian ‘bhajia’-style potatoes, and roasted vegetables blended with spicy mustard sauce.

If it’s the weekend …

Spend a night at Giraffe Manor, a luxurious, English-style country house built in 1932 that’s home to a herd of Rothschild giraffes. Its 12 luxury suites have sunny terraces and in-room fireplaces, but the real draw is the famous breakfast room, where the giraffes poke their heads through the windows each morning to beg for a bite of your eggs benedict. The property provides a car and driver for your stay, so cap off a day of horseback riding and hiking at the lounge-y Casablanca, famous for its shisha pipes, cocktails, and cold, local beer.

Toronto

If you’re going out on a weekday …

Drake One Fifty. (Youtube)

Grab a pre-dinner drink at Drake One Fifty, where cold weather tonics include the Brown Butter Maple Old Fashioned (a classic that’s spiffed-up with maple cigar tincture and mole bitters). Then make your way down the street to Ripley’s Aquarium, which is hosting a one-night-only, three-course dinner under the sea on Valentine’s Day. That’s not literal, of course: Tables are set within the aquarium’s galleries, and the menu is catered by local culinary outfit Daniel et Daniel. It includes such sustainable seafood options as branzino with hazelnuts and pickled cauliflower, plus a dramatic-looking raspberry white chocolate Baked Alaska for dessert.

If it’s the weekend …

Start your day with a group project: learning to make macarons with the pastry chef at Le Dolci, a rustic bake shop known for its dainty French cookies and stunning unicorn cakes. Keep the sweet theme going at the Ritz-Carlton’s internationally acclaimed spa. It’s most famous for high-tech diagnostic facials, but the chocolate body wrap treatment may be more apt for a romantic celebration. (Go the whole nine yards and opt for the hot stone massage add-on.) Snap out of your bliss for just long enough to get to Canoe, the longstanding destination restaurant atop the TD Bank Tower. Most restaurants with skyscraper views are tourist traps, but this one is a real winner, with a menu that’s fiercely Canadian. Case in point: an indigenous-inspired Haida Gwaii halibut with preserved lemon, and s’mores foie gras with toasted marshmallow cream.

New Delhi

If you’re going out on a weeknight …

Chef Manish Mehrotra of Indian Accent.

The most renowned restaurant in India, Indian Accent, has recently moved to a new location in the serene Lodhi Hotel. Use this as an excuse to book a table—and to work up an appetite in nearby Lodi Park. The tasting menu is as zany as ever: Think pork spare ribs with sun-dried mango and pickled kohlrabi. Afterward, take a car to the colorful, brick-walled Ek Bar, where bartenders will stir cocktails with fresh fruits and homemade syrups. Our favorite is the City of Nizams, a gin concoction flavored with turmeric.

If it’s the weekend …

The Taj Mahal (Shutterstock)

The Taj Mahal, about as grand a testimony to love as you’ll find in the world, is just two hours away—and when romance is the order of the day, there’s no better place to go. (The monument was commissioned in 1632 by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb for his favorite wife) Spend the night at the opulent Oberoi Amarvilas in Agra, which is mere steps away; most of its rooms have stunning views of the historic wonder. Raid the minibar and watch the sun set over the iconic white dome, then head downstairs for dinner at Esphahan. The menu highlights historical Mughal recipes once served to emperors, including slow-cooked kebabs, Mughal curries, and soft tandoori breads.

Jakarta

If you’re going out on a weekday …

Wake up early and take a meditative morning stroll among the mangroves in North Jakarta. If you can get into work a bit late, hire a boat to spot some unique birds and stoke some romance. For dinner, book Henshin, which set the city abuzz when it opened last summer. Located on the top three floors of the Westin Hotel—69 stories above the city—you can enjoy stunning sunset views while sipping cocktails and dining on authentic Nikkei cuisine, which blends Japanese and Peruvian flavors.

If it’s the weekend …

Explore Jakarta from above on a Whitesky Aviation heli-tour. Thrilling 30-minute joy flights fly low and weave among the skyscrapers, revealing sides of the Big Durian you may have never seen. (If you’d rather see nature, island and volcano itineraries are available, too.) After landing, take the adrenaline down a few notches. Feast your eyes on the artistic works and colors presented at the new contemporary Museum Macan, whose current exhibition showcases works by 70 artists, both local and international. Then it’s off to a relaxed meal of traditional Indonesian dishes at Tugu Kuntskring Paleis, set in a historic Dutch building.

Tel Aviv

If you’re going out on a weekday …

Dallal bakery in Neve Tzedek. (Youtube)

There’s no faster way to flip the switch from work to play than taking a walk on the beach, so head to the Jaffa boardwalk and watch the city light up from a distance. Then visit historic-yet-buzzy Neve Tzedek—home to Tel Aviv’s billionaire’s row—where you’ll find Dallal, a bakery that serves a full menu by night. Sit on the leafy terrace if the weather’s nice, and pick a smattering of Mediterranean dishes to share. (There’s never a bad choice). The kitchen is especially adept at dessert, so save room for the pistachio mille-feuille. Still have energy? Jajo, also in Neve Tzedek, is a wine bar tucked into a stone-walled, historic building that was once Israel’s first winery. Slide up to the bar and order glasses of French Crémant for one, last toast.

If it’s the weekend …

Efendi Hotel. (Youtube)

Tel Aviv offers no shortage of culinary delights, but less than two hours north, in Acre, a whole other food scene awaits discovery. A day trip is doable, but book a night at the ancient-feeling Efendi Hotel to maximize your time. It’s a stunning preservation of two Ottoman homes, with original arched windows that face the Mediterranean Sea. Then head out on a market tour with chef Uri Jeremias, who runs the famous Uri Buri restaurant nearby and can explain how Arabic, Islamic, and Jewish flavors inform his most famous dishes. Cap it off with homemade cardamom or Halva ice cream at Endomela—then return to privacy with a session at the Efendi’s stunning Turkish hammam. Luckily for you, Jeremias will get to work on your ingredients while you pamper yourself, so dinner will be waiting by the time you’re hungry again.

Houston

If you’re going out on a weekday …

Air Texas Balloon Adventures. (Youtube)

Take a sunset hot air balloon ride with Air Texas Balloon Adventures and you’ll get beautiful overhead views of the plains and the Gulf of Mexico—or charter your own journey by asking the pilot (who has over 40 years of aeronautical experience) to show you his favorite views. Back at sea level, a Champagne toast will await you and the crew. Cap it off with a meal at Beaver’s, the award-winning barbeque spot known for its excellent brisket, hot-fried chicken, and panko-crusted, deep-fried brownie balls.

If it’s the weekend …

Have a spa day at the Four Seasons, where a recent multimillion-dollar renovation has provided steam rooms, a nail salon, multiple treatment rooms, a relaxation area, and a couples’ suite, all with state-of-the-art amenities. After a peaceful treatment—our pick is the chakra-balancing massage with eucalyptus oil—lounge on the outdoor pool deck and sip a fresh Ginger-Melon Fizz. Come sundown, you’ll be ready for a different kind of indulgence: a meal of sophisticated Creole comforts at the iconic Brennan’s of Houston, starting with West Indies crab claws and Louisiana oysters from the raw bar and culminating with andouille mac and cheese.

Santiago, Chile

If you’re going out on a weeknight …

Skip out of work a bit early for couples’ massages at the Singular Hotel in buzzy Lastarria. You can book a few hours of pampering or a whole evening affair: The resort’s “Honey Lovely Moon” package includes an overnight stay, plus dinner at the hotel’s restaurant, chocolates, a bottle of sparkling wine for your room, and late checkout the next day. For a nightcap that’s sure to impress, ask the concierge to book you at Room 09—one of the hardest bars to get into. It’s on a rooftop above one of Santiago’s top restaurants, 040, and requires a one-day “membership fee” of $17. Need a Plan B? Azotea Matilde, in the bohemian quarter of Bellavista, has great drinks—and views to match.

Take a 2.5-hour drive south, to Vik Vineyard near Santa Cruz. The winery, an architectural marvel built by local designer Smiljan Radic, has an excellent hotel and restaurant. For comparison, travel 30 minutes farther to Vina Montes, which makes some of Chile’s greatest wines. Last year, it partnered with international celebrity chef Francis Mallman to open the Fuegos de Apalta restaurant, which serves beef from specially raised local cattle and fish from the Colchagua coast. The food is memorable on its own, but you won’t forget the restaurant’s dramatic focal point: a three-meter-high fire pit that’s used to roast and smoke a majority of the dishes.

Melbourne

If you’re going out on a weeknight …

Moonlight Cinema in Melbourne’s Royal Botanic Gardens. (Youtube)

Pack a picnic rug, your favorite snacks, and a nice bottle of wine (we recommend Shiraz) to the outdoor Moonlight Cinema in Melbourne’s beautiful Royal Botanic Gardens; this Wednesday you’ll catch a screening of Australia’s favorite son, Hugh Jackman, in The Greatest Showman. After that, wander back across the Yarra River, through the Gehry-esque Federation Square, to chef Frank Camorra’s famed Spanish restaurant Movida for fried zucchini flowers stuffed with crab or milk-fed beer tartare on potato paper. Bonus: It’s located in Hosier Lane, known for incredible street murals.

If it’s the weekend …

Spend the morning at the National Gallery of Victoria’s triennial exhibition, featuring 100 artists from 32 countries. Stroll or take a tram to St Kilda Beach, get your toes wet, and then wander through the edgy boutiques and the street market on the esplanade. Stop for a bowl of pasta and an aperitif at Cicciolina, followed by dessert at Monarch Cakes, a Melbourne institution. Then walk to the 105-year-old Luna Park, complete with a classic called the Scenic Railway—it’s the world’s oldest continually operating roller coaster. (On Valentine’s Day, everyone will be a winner at the carnival games, and tickets to the park will come with a fairy floss (cotton candy) to share.) If you’re still game, the iconic Stokehouse restaurant is just across the road, and although the dining room has just been renovated, the sea views and market fish are as great as ever.

London

If you’re going out on a weeknight …

Book a bed at Electric Cinema in Notting Hill—the Soho House-owned theater has just a handful of two-person beds and sofas for each showing—from which you can watch one of the season’s Oscar-nominated love stories, The Shape of Water or Phantom Thread. Follow it up with a different kind of spice: London’s Indian food is some of the best in the world, and Trishna is just across Hyde Park, in Marylebone. The dining room is charming and intimate, and the six-course tasting menu features such knockouts as lobster balchao (seasoned with palm vinegar, mace, and red chili) and tandoori pineapple for dessert.

If it’s the weekend …

A delightful London weekend experience starts at Mr. Fogg’s Residence, a cute Mayfair bar with eclectic decor and massive cocktail menu. The tipsy tea is best—it involves Earl Grey- or Lapsang souchong-infused cocktails served from teapots, as well as a traditional array of sandwiches and cakes, plus live music and (on Sundays) tricks by the resident magician. Then cross the Thames for a visit with Modigliani’s artful nudes at the Tate Modern, making sure to snap some Instagram-worthy boomerangs on the swings outside. For dinner, head to Elystan Street in Chelsea, where chef Philip Howard (previously of the two-Michelin-star spot Square) serves up his take on pure, seasonal cuisine.

New York

If you’re going out on a weeknight …

A statue at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. (Youtube)

If it’s Valentine’s Day, head to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a rare uptown performance by Tony winner Alan Cummings, who will appear for one night in Many Fathoms Deep, a snappy cabaret-style homage (7 p.m., tickets from $75). Then shoot over to La Goulue—a New York institution that’s recently been reborn. The dining room will transport you to Paris, and you won’t be forced into a tired, prix fixe meal; instead order the steak au poivre verte with frites and the iconic, served-at-dinner only chocolate soufflé. Cap it all off at another renowned spot, Bemelman’s Bar at the Carlyle, where the best-selling Passion Royale cocktail is made with passion fruit-infused vodka, lime juice, and a splash of Champagne.

If it’s the weekend …

Hire a car for the day. Your first stop is the Cloisters, the castle-like museum in the upper reaches of Manhattan with views of the Hudson River and a magnificent collection of tapestries. From there, head to Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture. You can take a winter farm tour or simply settle in at the Grain Café for a seasonal salad and house made charcuterie sandwiches from the James Beard award-winning kitchen. Then it’s down to the Bronx—specifically, to Dominick’s on Arthur Avenue for baked clams, linguine with meatballs, and as much Chianti as your hearts desire.

Bogota

If you’re going out on a weekday …

Have the local travel specialists at Galavanta set up a private cooking class with Nicolas Rengifo, chef at of-the-moment Krone Bistro. He’ll take you to Plaza de Mercado del Norte to shop for farm-fresh ingredients, then drive you back to the restaurant for a hands-on demo. You’ll learn to make dishes like fish empanadas and chocolate-avocado panna cotta with Rengifo and his partner Ana Maria—who’ll offer up a soundtrack from their sprawling record collection and serve you home-brewed beer as you chop, stir, and sauté.

If it’s the weekend …

Start your day with a molecular coffee tasting, or “coffee baptism,” at the San Alberto coffee shop in the Usaquén neighborhood—the former offers your daily dose of caffeine served up with dry ice or distilled into caviar-like pearls, while the latter feels more like a lesson in wine tasting. Then head to Castanyoles at the Four Seasons Casa Medina, where brunch includes homemade Colombian breads and pastries in a verdant solarium. Between that and dinner at Bistro El Bandido (whose ambiance is ratcheted up by live jazz), check out the cutting-edge Espacio El Dorado art gallery in La Macarena and then jump on the teleférico to Monserrate for sunset views over the entire metropolis.

Frankfurt

If you’re going out on a weeknight …

Book a table at either Holbein’s Restaurant (next to the famous Städel Museum) or Gusto restaurant, set within the beautiful Villa Kennedy. Both places offer excellent food and easy access to the Main riverfront—perfect for a romantic, post-dinner walk along the water, with postcard views of the city’s skyline.

If it’s the weekend …

Build your day around a reservation at Maintower restaurant and lounge—which serves upscale, international dishes from a 53rd-floor space that offers breathtaking views of Germany’s financial capital. Beforehand, take in some natural beauty at nearby Rothschild park—or stop by Italian Opera night at the Old Opera building. Go further upbeat after your meal: by then, you’re likely to find one of the world’s top DJs spinning at the centrally located Gibson Club, where the Champagne drinks flow freely until the early morning hours.

Amsterdam

If you’re going out on a weeknight …

The posh thing to do is take high tea a block from the Royal Palace at the Duchess, a Belle Epoque space with soaring ceilings, where Wednesday’s ‘Valen-tea’ includes your pick of Mariage Frères blends, a glass of Champagne, and a full menu of “sweets for your sweet.” Then head to the Concertgebouw, the royal concert hall: The orchestra is scheduled to perform a selection of romantic classics that night, such as Ravel’s Bolero and Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 5. Nearby, the Conservatorium Hotel is a sumptuous place to spend the night—its signature restaurant, Taiko, has a set Valentine’s Day dinner menu that includes oysters and personalized fortune cookies, but you might be happier with a fancy gin and tonic at the Tunes bar and an indulgent room service dinner. (Bonus points if you choose to enjoy it in your plush bathrobes.)

If it’s the weekend …

Take a 30-minute drive outside the city to Muiderslot, a 13th century castle that’s been exquisitely renovated and converted into an art museum; the current exhibition, ‘Eroticism in the Golden Age,’ provides an intimate look at the bedroom secrets of the Dutch during the 17th century. Back in the scenic Jordaan neighborhood along the city’s famed canals, head to the beloved Italian red-sauce joint, Toscanini. The immediate area is perfect for a romantic stroll: Book fiends can stop at Mendo, or you can spice things up at the shop of lingerie designer Marlies Dekkers, a Dutch staple for 25 years. Nightcap it at Tales & Spirits, where you can order the Mo-Jo, a “libido enhancing mix” of Ketel One vodka, Goji and lemon juice, honey syrup, and Bob’s vanilla bitters.

Pay a local to plan your trip? This new service may change travel bookings forever,https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/pay-a-local-to-plan-your-trip-this-new-service-may-change-travel-bookings-forever/story-YZhfA3KQ5YL1jXht7Pfl4O.html,"Thu, 05 Apr 2018 08:45:18 GMT","Is a company called ViaHero creating a new model for travel? For a flat fee of $25 a day, travellers can use a service called ViaHero to hire locals on the ground to plan out their trips, arranging everything from lodging and airport pickup to sightseeing and dining. The service combines authentic local recommendations, convenient online booking and the old-school guidance of a travel agent.

So far it’s available in Cuba, Iceland, Japan and Colombia, with plans to add Ecuador and other South American countries this year. Trips are customised to fit any budget. Travellers can be independent with as much unstructured time as they like, or ViaHero can hire tour guides, drivers and even personal chefs.

“It’s like having a local friend who has all the same interests as you plan your trip,” said ViaHero CEO Greg Buzulencia in an interview. Buzulencia has loved planning trips since he was a child in Youngstown, Ohio. At age 16, he says, he “begged and pleaded his way” to become an official “TripTik” planner for AAA. (ripTiks provided customised routes for road trips long before you could get maps and directions online.

Eventually, Buzulencia turned his passion into a 21st- century travel business. He came up with ViaHero because he felt the traditional travel industry wasn’t meeting the demand for “authentic local experiences” and “personal curation” in trip planning. The company has arranged more than 3,000 trips since launching in 2016 with travel to Cuba. ViaHero also ensures compliance with US regulations for those Cuba trips.

It works like this. You go to ViaHero.com, enter information about yourself and your interests, and the website matches you with a planner in your destination who then emails you about your preferences. You get a customised itinerary that can be downloaded or printed out like a personalised guidebook detailing what to see, where to eat and how to get around.

Buzulencia compares the service to having a personal concierge. The $25-a-day fee is per group, not per person. For an extra $10 a day, you get additional services like phone support during your trip. But why should travellers pay ViaHero $25 a day when travel agents will plan trips for free?

“There are plenty of travel agents out there still and a lot of them are doing a great job,” Buzulencia said. “But I think the intimidation factor is, how do I find one? How do I find one that’s good?” Of course, one major reason people use traditional travel agents is that in case of an emergency or change of plans, a travel agent can often seamlessly and at no cost re-book flights and other trip components for you.

ViaHero planners will suggest specific flights for your trip and provide links for you to book them, but if you need to change or cancel your flight, you’re on your own when it comes to pleading your case with an airline. ViaHero has, however, stepped in to help travellers with emergencies. One customer lost her passport in Cuba the night before flying home. Her ViaHero contact arranged a driver to go to the US Embassy, where officials sorted things out, and she made her flight home the next day.

Tough love: Philippine President Duterte shuts Boracay Island in order to save it,https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/tough-love-philippine-president-duterte-shuts-boracay-island-in-order-to-save-it/story-Ge476F0iC9HRu7fhEGQpsM.html,"Thu, 05 Apr 2018 07:52:56 GMT","Boracay Island, one of Asia’s top beach destinations, will be shut for six months after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte approved a proposal from the environment and tourism agencies to close the area for rehabilitation.

The island, known for its white-sand beaches, will be closed starting April 26, at the height of the peak summer season. The government estimates losses of up to 20 billion pesos ($384 million) in tourist receipts during the six-month shutdown. Speeding up rehabilitation may accelerate its soft opening to as early as July, Tourism Assistant Secretary Ricky Alegre says in a televised press briefing.

Philippine Airlines and Cebu Air’s Cebu Pacific will cancel flights to Boracay during the closure, the airlines said in separate statements. Boracay Island’s White Beach was ranked Asia’s second-best beach destination by TripAdvisor.

The closure of the island, which Duterte earlier described as a ‘cesspool,’ could also deal a blow to the nation’s target to attract 7.4 million tourists this year. About 15 % of the 6.6 million tourists in the Philippines visited Boracay last year, spending 56 billion pesos in the tourist spot.

Four other tourist destinations will be investigated next: Puerto Galera in Mindoro, El Nido and Coron in Palawan, Bohol and Siargao, Alegre said.

The government will release 2 billion pesos in emergency funds to help 36,000 workers who may be affected by the closure, Harry Roque, spokesman of President Rodrigo Duterte, said in the same briefing.

San Miguel Corp., the nation’s largest company by sales and the operator of an airport near the resort island, said it supports government’s initiative.

“The island needs to be rehabilitated and we have to support the government,” the company’s president Ramon Ang said in a statement. “Yes, we will endure some short-term pain but it’s a step in the right direction and in end we are hopeful it would bring about long-term gain for all.”

Mandatory induction programme for new engineering students from this year,https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/mandatory-induction-programme-for-new-engineering-students-from-this-year/story-wzI6QdFyz2sf7nJvSEnsdI.html,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:29:43 GMT","New students in more than 3,000 engineering colleges under the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) will undergo a compulsory induction programme from this academic year to familiarise them to the new environment and encourage them to look beyond classrooms.

The chairperson of the technical education regulator, Anil Sahasrabudhe, said the first three weeks would be earmarked for the induction programme, which will expose the students to physical activity, arts and social issues as well.

“The programme will also be used to rectify some critical lacunas, for example, holding special English classes for those students who have a deficiency in it,” a senior AICTE official said.

“Also, students from the disadvantaged sections of the society and economically weaker sections will also get an opportunity to go for extra classes for physics and mathematics so that they are able to keep up with what is being taught in the classrooms,” the official added.

Officials said that during this period no classes will be held.

All students will have to follow a daily routine of physical activity with games and sports and each of them will pick one game and learn it during the three weeks.

They will be asked to choose one skill related to visual or performing arts and they will also hold discussions on universal values. The universal values module will aim to build relationships between teachers and students, which last for the four-year stay and possibly beyond, apart from drawing their attention to larger issues of life.

The induction programme was discussed and approved for all colleges by the regulator in March 2017.

The proficiency module would be used to overcome critical lacunas that students might have, for example, English and computer familiarity among others.

“These should run like crash courses so that when normal courses start after the induction program, the student has overcome the lacunas substantially. We hope that problems arising due to lack of English skills, wherein students start lagging behind or failing in several subjects, for no fault of theirs, would, hopefully, become a thing of the past,” the regulator said in a statement last year.

The court issued the order on a petition filed by Amiya Salim, a student of Mount Carmel School in Kottayam. It directed the CBSE to conduct a re-examination for her before the completion of the paper evaluation process. While hearing the plea, CBSE told the court that an internal inquiry was on to find out how the mix-up happened.

The Class 10 Maths paper was initially cancelled by CBSE after reports emerged that the question paper had been leaked. CBSE later decided that a re-examination was not warrented.

After getting the old question paper during the exam held on March 28, Amiya said she immediately alerted the school authorities who in turn informed the CBSE regional office. She moved court after she failed to get any response from the CBSE regional office in Thiruvananthapuram.

“I was initially shocked. I got the same paper that my brother Altaf Salim attempted two years ago. The school authorities later advised me to attempt the paper,” she said. Later some of her teachers also confirmed that it was an old question paper.

“The CBSE will have to explain how this happened. You can’t take students for granted. I will prepare well and score good marks,” she said. When contacted the CBSE regional office refused to make any comment.","The Class 10 Maths paper was initially cancelled by CBSE after reports emerged that the question paper had been leaked.

The plea was mentioned before a bench of Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar which listed it for a hearing on Tuesday.

The CBSE had on April 3 decided not to conduct the retest in Delhi-NCR and Haryana, the two regions where the leak reportedly took place.

A day before the decision of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the high court had asked the board to inform it by April 16 about its plans, if any, for a re-examination.

A reality check of a primary school in Naubasta Kala in Chinhat block of Lucknow revealed that students are yet to receive their new textbooks in English. They were found reading lessons from old books in Hindi.

“This is for the first time that English medium government schools have started functioning. Printing of new textbooks is on and it will be made available to students by next month. Till such time, they are using Hindi books of previous sessions,” said an official in the basic education department. The official did not want to be named.

An order dated March 27, issued by director basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh said: “In view of delay in printing of new books, the old textbooks shall be distributed free among students till such time the new books get printed. Once the new books arrive, they will replace the old ones.”

At Naubasta Kala primary school, teachers were found teaching English alphabets to students with the help of chart papers and sketch pens. Another teacher in the same school used blackboard to make students familiar with English alphabets.

Teachers at some other primary schools said the delay was affecting studies and distracting students. “The new academic session comes with a lot of craze for students. They look forward to getting new books. Since the session has started and new books are yet to be distributed, students are managing with old books of their seniors,” a teacher said.

“The old books are in a bad shape. Moreover, not every student has received books. They are yet to get a feel of new session,” said another teacher at a government primary school in Nirala Nagar.

Following in the footsteps of CBSE and ICSE boards, the education department had, in 2015, adopted the practice of starting new academic session from April.

Before this, the new session used to begin in July. Last year too, the students were not given textbooks for several months and received it only when the school reopened after the vacation in July.","At least 5,000 government-run primary schools got the ‘English medium’ tag on April 2 with the launch of School Chalo Abhiyan in UP, but there is hardly any change at the ground level.

A few questions in the paper were straightforward and could be solved by a student who has been preparing sincerely for the exam. But a large numbers of questions required lengthy solutions. A few questions were difficult which will play crucial role to get top scores.

In all the three subjects, 5-6 questions were framed quite differently. However there was no ambiguous question in the paper this year.

In Physics paper, overall questions were slightly on the difficult side compared to last year. By and large, paper was on the expected lines with few elements of surprise. Almost all the topics were covered as prescribed by CBSE for JEE (Main).

The Mathematics paper overall was slightly on the difficult side. There were seven to eight lengthy questions, but a few questions were straightforward as well. Questions were asked from all Chapters. Questions asked were conceptual and nearer to the JEE advanced paper in terms of tricks and approach. Students whose study was confined to NCERT and related text books would find it difficult. Equal weightage was given to 11th and 12th syllabus.

In Chemistry, almost equal weightage of Physical, Organic and Inorganic Chemistry was there. Paper has average difficulty level. No question was asked from the topics of Structure of atom, d & f-block, Aldehyde Ketone, s-block, Polymer & Surface Chemistry. Overall paper was balanced and mixture of conceptual and numerical questions.

Students with coaching will have an edge in terms of speed and thus will score better.

A final-year woman student of the university’s affiliate SMJ College in Khajedih of Madhubani, about 145km from state capital Patna, found the photo of a woman in lingerie on her admit card.

The woman, a home science honours student, lodged a complaint with the authorities on Monday and pleaded for a new admit card carrying her picture at the earliest. The examinations are scheduled to begin from Tuesday and she has only a day at hand.

“At the time of registration, I had checked all the details before signing it. However, when I took a print-out of the admit card on Saturday, I was shocked to see the offending pictures in place of my photo and signature,” the student said.

SMJ College principal Dr Jagdish Prasad said the administration has nothing to do with any irregularities detected in the admit card as all examination related formalities are conducted by the university online.

The university’s examination controller Kulanand Yadav said he immediately ordered the offensive picture to be deleted and replaced with that of the examinee as soon as the matter was brought to his notice.

But on Monday afternoon, when this correspondent downloaded the woman’s admit card from the varsity’s website, the document neither had her photograph nor her signature.

The university, however, distanced itself from the controversy and stressed again that the mistake didn’t happen at their end.

Yadav said that he had sought a written explanation from concerned agency, which was roped in to issue admit card online.

“We would be able to trace out the lapse in this regard soon,” the controller said.

Last year in October, the university issued an admit card bearing the photograph and signature of the Hindu deity Ganesha to Krishna Kumar Roy, a first-year BCom (Hons) student of JN College, Nehera.

Authorities had held the student responsible, saying he was responsible for submitting his examination form online.

“The person at the cyber cafe had replaced his image with Ganesha’s before submitting the form. The university wasn’t at fault,” the controller had said.

The special investigation team of Delhi Police’s Crime Branch on Saturday arrested three staff members of the DAV School in Una in connection with the case.

“The trio will be taken to Una, possibly on Monday, to reconstruct the entire scene. The investigation so far has revealed that the paper was leaked from there, although it went viral through around 40 WhatsApp groups in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and maybe other states,” said a senior Delhi Police officer on Sunday.

The paper was allegedly leaked by DAV School’s economics teacher Rakesh Kumar, with the help of his colleague Amit Sharma, a clerk and Ashok Kumar, a peon of the school, three days before the Economics paper was scheduled on March 26.

“We will question the manager of the Union Bank of India as well as the principal of the Navodaya Vidyalaya in Una, where Rakesh was a superintendent of the CBSE exam,” he said.

Rakesh had allegedly taken out a bundle of the economics paper from the bank’s strong room on March 23, while taking out a bundle of the computer science paper, which was due that day.

A hand-written copy of the economics paper was then sent to many through 40 WhatsApp groups.

“We will also question the students who got the hand-written copy of the paper. The student in Una, who copied the paper in her handwriting and who was being helped by Rakesh, will also be questioned,” the officer said.

The Crime Branch will also question a female relative of Rakesh in Chandigarh, whom he had allegedly sent the hand-written question paper through WhatsApp. Two other women, who were sent the paper by the relative, will also be questioned, he added.","The Delhi Police will take the three arrested accused in the CBSE Class 12 Economics paper leak case to Una in Himachal Pradesh to reconstruct the sequence of events and question some more people there, sources said.

Close to 12 lakh students had applied for the exam. Of them only 2.2 lakh will be eligible for the JEE Advanced, which paves the gateway to IITs and other prestigious colleges.

The examination evoked mixed reaction from students across the country. Here is how students across the country reacted after the exam.

Allahabad

Mahendra Patel, a resident of Madhya Padesh, who appeared in the exam at YMCA Centenary School and College, Allahabad said: “The JEE Main paper cannot be described as easy or tough. I attempted all questions but the Mathematics part was exhausting due to complex nature of questions.”

“The Physics portion of the paper, though was in accordance to class 11 and class 12 syllabus, was tough compared to questions of Mathematics and Chemistry,” said Adarsh Kumar, a resident of Faizabad district of Uttar Pradesh.

“Physics questions were tough. I attempted all questions pertaining to Mathematics and Chemistry,” said Saurabh Shukla, a resident of Allahabad who appeared in the exam.

Bhopal

A class 12 student Ishita Pawan said, “Barring 3-4 questions in all the sections, I found the paper quite easy. The pattern of the paper was similar to the last year’s paper.”

Another student Shaksham Sharma said, “The physics was the tougher one as compare to Maths and Chemistry. Most of the questions were asked from the syllabus of Class 11.”

A teacher of a reputed institute, who is not authorised to comment, said, “Overall the paper was of moderate difficulty level. The Chemistry’s questions were lengthy. A few students found difficulty in answering questions of organic chemistry. The cut-off will be similar to that of last year.”

Lucknow

Candidates who took the JEE Mains in Lucknow were of the view that question paper in the first shift was quite lengthy and many of them could not answer all questions. They also found the question paper to be tricky.

Both Riya and Aditi from Lucknow were of the view that they had to race against time as the question paper of the first shift was lengthy. “We had to struggle to complete the paper. Some of the questions were tricky too,” one of them said, while the other agreed.

Priyanshu of Ambedkar Nagar too said he is worried as JEE has negative marking, so a wrong answer leads to deduction of one mark. Shivang and Priyanshi, both from Lucknow said, “We never expected that difficulty level of the question paper will be high.”

Kota

Students in Kota had a mixed response about the difficulty level of the exam. Talking about the question paper, aspirant Akansha Laddha (18) said she had appeared for the JEE Main exam last year (2017) but found Sunday’s JEE Main paper a bit difficult compared to last year. “While mathematics part was easy, chemistry was tricky and physics was of moderate level,” she said.

Another aspirant Subhra Supakar (18) said that the Paper was easier particularly physics part, whereas chemistry portion had more organic chemistry based questions than inorganic chemistry. She said mathematics was easier.

Riya Banzal (19), another student who took the exam this year said that the mathematics part was lengthy, whereas chemistry had less inorganic questions.

Mumbai

Sumit Vyas, a candidate from Mumbai said the Mathematics section was the lengthiest. “Most of us could not attempt the full section as most questions were time consuming. Algebra was given more importance than calculus in the paper,” he said. Many students are planning to challenge such questions with the CBSE that conducted the exam.

Manya Goel, another candidate thought the problems in most sections were solvable but time was a problem. “Except for a couple of questions in the Chemistry section, I found all other questions of medium difficulty level. However, it was difficult to solve the paper in three hours,” she said.

“We are happy that it was a copying-free examination and the answer sheets have been evaluated in time. We will declare the results of UP Board examinations for Class 10 and Class 12 in April,” Sharma, who was in Jaunpur to inaugurate a school, told reporters.

In the coming months, he said, this practice will be replicated in universities and colleges. “All universities have been directed to ensure all examinations are over by June 15. The government is also making efforts that from next year all universities hold their examinations at the same time.”

The board exams this year were conducted amid tight security and strict measures were put in place to discourage cheating. Reports have said more than 10 lakh students skipped the exams - conducted between February 6 and March 12.

Sharma previously said the objective of the measures was “copying-free examinations”.

Today he claimed: “The state government has checkmated copying mafia in the state. Some elements who are still running away from the government, will be identified by next year.”

The deputy chief minister, who also holds the portfolio of secondary and higher education, said the UP government has launched an Internet portal for teachers to register grievances.

“Whatever the service-related grievances of teachers be, will be resolved by June,” Sharma said.

He said the secondary schools will have a syllabus on the pattern of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).

The new academic session will start on April 16, and by July the new education calendar will be issued, he said.

Book Review: There is nothing frivolous about Diptakirti Chaudhuri’s Bioscope,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/book-review-there-is-nothing-frivolous-about-diptakirti-chaudhuri-s-bioscope/story-SOJ24WuRWh5x6Q7pOxPyzL.html,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 12:46:09 GMT","What do you expect from a book that claims to document, even if lightly, close to eight decades of breathless filmmaking, in just over 200 pages? Diptakirti Chaudhuri’s Bioscope, just like its quirky cover (a die-cut top layer that part-reveals, part-conceals a priceless poster of the 1958 movie Devta), is an endearing attempt at giving the reader a peek into the show-business that is Bollywood.

The book debunks conventional linearity in favour of a narrative that takes up themes that have been concurrent nearly at all times in the history of Bollywood. However, the individual chapters deal with these themes chronologically, starting from the 40s or the 50s, and culminating in the present day.

From how our favourite songs got made, how the audience’s fashion sense and that of filmstars have informed each other, to how the industry’s most memorable expats were often reduced to stereotypical characters, and how films have identified not only the audience’s pleasure points but its nerve — this book has it all. How Zeishan Quadri, emboldened by his watching of the Brazilian crime drama City of God (2003), pitched his desi crime story set in the hinterland of modern-day Jharkhand, to Anurag Kashyap, who liked it and came up with his legendary magnum opus in two parts, Gangs of Wasseypur (2012). How artisans and dressmakers were flown in from Old Delhi for the grandiloquent Mughal-e-Azam (1958), so that absolute historical authenticity could be achieved in terms of the way the characters looked. Or how Bhiku Mhatre, the character Manoj Bajpayee played in Satya, was named after an attendant that would bring chai for Ramgopal Varma.

Chaudhuri suitably peppers the narrative with forgotten films and landmark art-house attempts, and garnishes with lots of humour and familiarity. This helps to achieve readability even with chapters that some readers could find journalistic and more thoughtful than others, like the opening one that discusses box-office collections, or the concluding chapter that succinctly furnishes a sharp, concise history of modern Bollywood, right from the bloody partition that followed our Independence, the Sino-Indian war, constant acts of cross-border terrorism, the 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid, and the orgasmic moment India won the 2011 Cricket World Cup. This chapter makes for a beautiful antithesis to the otherwise lighthearted tone of the book.

That the book is ‘opinionated and emotional’ helps it avoid turning into a bland collection of trivia on a film industry. It is evident that Chaudhuri knows film industries and ways of filmmaking cannot be subjected to the same measuring scale, and this helps him to appreciate the Hindi mainstream industry benevolently, and with greater nuance. He unearths lost gems like Haqeeqat (1964), and separates the wheat from the chaff in gloriously bad attempts. No wonder another writer on Bollywood, Amborish Roychoudhury, credits Chaudhuri with sparking debates, in the afterword of his In A Cult of His Own: Bollywood Beyond the Box Office.

The language is lucid, and there is never a dull moment in the book, which is an asset when you’re dealing with a small page count. He has done it earlier it in his Cricket! All You Wanted to Know, a book about cricket World Cups, the slightly-longer, but insightful Written by Salim-Javed and Kitnay Aadmi Thay. Anyway, Bioscope is one for the cinephiles, and not just the frivolous ones.","The book debunks conventional linearity in favour of a narrative that takes up themes that have been concurrent nearly at all times in the history of Bollywood.

Carl XVI Gustav, the patron of the Swedish Academy who must approve any of the secret votes by the 18-member body before the result is made public, said the Academy was “thinking the situation through.” “It is a very, very, very important institution, so I am kept informed about developments,” he briefly told Swedish media. He said he was confident the problems at the academy would be solved “sooner or later.”

Klas Ostergren, Kjell Espmark and Peter Englund resigned on April 6 after the body voted against removing Katarina Frostenson, an Academy member since 1992, whose husband has been accused of sexual misconduct.

Swedish media have identified Frostenson’s husband as French-born Jean-Claude Arnault, the director of a Stockholm cultural centre. He was banned in December by the Swedish Academy from attending a Nobel banquet after Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter published allegations from 18 women claiming to have been assaulted or raped by Arnault.

The trio had called for her exclusion. None of the three was immediately reachable for comment.

Although he has not spoken publicly, Swedish media have identified Frostenson’s husband as French-born Jean-Claude Arnault, the director of a Stockholm cultural centre. He was banned in December by the Swedish Academy from attending a Nobel banquet after Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter published allegations from 18 women claiming to have been assaulted or raped by Arnault. He has denied wrongdoing to the paper.

The alleged assaults occurred between 1996 and 2017, according to the newspaper, one of Sweden’s largest.

According to NPR, Dagens Nyheter reported on April 9 that Arnault leaked the names of at least seven recent Nobel winners before they were announced — including Bob Dylan, Svetlana Alexievich and Patrick Modiano.

In March, Sweden’s prosecution authority said the investigation into reported rape and sexual abuse during the period March 2013-April 2015 had been dropped but the probe into other criminal acts would continue. It did not give further details.

The Academy also said last year that an annual funding of 126,000 kronor (approx Rs 10 lakh) to the center had been stopped immediately. The money had been paid to the institution since 2010 and the Academy stressed it had not been paid to Arnault personally. Academy members often attend events at the center including literary readings, academic lectures, dance and music.

Judges on the 18-member committee are appointed for life. In 1989, three judges quit after the academy refused to denounce Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for calling for the death of The Satanic Verses author Salman Rushdie.

Graphic novel tells story of UK’s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/graphic-novel-tells-story-of-uk-s-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle/story-DPabMZbBriAs3E17lci1lM.html,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:46:46 GMT","Fans of Britain’s royal family eagerly awaiting Prince Harry’s wedding to American actor Meghan Markle in May can read about the couple’s romance in a colourful comic book.

Harry, Queen Elizabeth’s grandson and fifth in line to the throne, will tie the knot with Markle on May 19 at Windsor Castle, the palace that has been the home of British kings and queens for almost 1,000 years. They have attracted large cheering crowds in public appearances since their engagement was announced in November 2017.

The comic, The Royals: Prince Harry & Meghan Markle, is available online in three versions: a traditional 26-page comic book, a hardback 40-page graphic novel and a wedding edition with a special cover by artist Joey Mason.

Mason’s credits include My Little Pony: The Movie, Green Lantern: The Animated Series and Scooby-Doo projects.

The comic book about Harry and Markle is published by U.S.-based TidalWave Productions, which has produced comics about other British royals, including Harry’s older brother, Prince William, and Kate Middleton before their wedding.

“Fans of the royal couple will love this issue for portraying Harry and Meghan as two well-rounded and grounded individuals,” publisher Darren Davis said in a statement. “But it also has enough pomp and spectacle to match the excitement surrounding the event.”

The comic details Harry’s life, including his military career, and Markle’s biracial background, her previous divorce and her acting career. It also includes the death of Harry’s mother, Princess Diana.

One panel of the comic reads: “The public couldn’t help but wonder when the young prince would settle down and assume duties of the state. The pressure was on for Harry to leave the bachelor life behind when his brother, Prince William, married Kate Middleton.”

The book describes how Harry and Markle met in 2016 through a mutual friend who set them up and how they travelled together to Botswana. It also discusses the couple’s engagement and how Markle’s ring includes Diana’s diamonds.The couple has invited 600 guests to their wedding and requested charitable donations in lieu of gifts.

The wedding is likely to attract huge attention around the world, as did the 2011 marriage of William and Kate Middleton, which was watched by an estimated 2 billion people.

Insta poet Cleo Wade’s new book Heart Talk encourages a healthy soul diet,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/insta-poet-cleo-wade-s-new-book-heart-talk-encourages-a-healthy-soul-diet/story-9U429Gl9zDcu1kBg8yZr0N.html,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:30:34 GMT","Cleo Wade is known for not only her poetry, but her positive, uplifting Instagram mantras that have earned her a following that includes Yara Shahidi and Jessica Alba.

So it’s not surprising that on a day when she’s running around like crazy promoting her new book, she doesn’t complain about being tired, but has another affirmation that fuels her eternally optimistic outlook.

“I (recently) went on a complaint cleanse,” said the poet and activist, whose reasoning was simple. “‘Your dream book is coming out into the world, it’s exactly the book you wanted to make. You can find a way to not complain about the logistics, work and people and things that come with it.’“

Heart Talk: Poetic Wisdom for a Better Life isn’t a self-help book, but it contains plenty of verses from Wade that are aimed to feed the soul — she calls it a “healthy soul diet.” Her inspirational slant has led her to be being called the Oprah for millennials. The book covers everything from self-worth to relationships.

“What is the opposite of self-care? Self-abandonment. We’re also in this state of not being able to practice self-care in our dynamics with our neighbour, our partner, our boss, our colleague, the world,” she said. “There’s so much nourishment that is needed for that space, in order for us to feel really cared for so we can recognise how to care for other people.”

You spend hours with fans at book signings. Why is it so important for you to give people your full attention?

Wade: There is a desire for people to be seen and heard. We can’t possibly learn how to love our neighbour unless we find common ground with them. But also we can’t understand how to listen to others if we don’t listen to ourselves. Whenever young people email me about heartbreak I tell them, this is the most divine point in which to listen to yourself because there’s such an education as far as your learning, your needs and desires.

You must find wherever you go people want deep conversation and encouragement.

Wade: I’m definitely the person that if I am in a space, I’m looking for the macro-connection and if I feel like I can’t take that on, I just stay home. For me, I definitely have that boundary of if I don’t feel like I could really be in that space, hear about your life, show up for you, and offer the best of me to you, then I know that’s a day that I need to stay home.

Where does your outlook on the world come from?

Wade: (Laughs) I definitely think a lot of it comes from growing up in a place like New Orleans because it’s a deeply expressive culture. Also my dad is an artist, my mom is a chef. Having these people with such clear manifestations of what they like to do with their time, it definitely fuelled me to understand that there is a very individualised thing you can do in the world.

Social media has really helped you spread your message but do you find it can be toxic sometimes?

Wade: It can either be used as a tool or a weapon. I always encourage people to really monitor their media diets. I don’t think food is the only thing we digest. We also ingest information and if you’re finding your media feels really divisive or if it’s making you judge or covet in a way that doesn’t make you feel good, then it’s time to maybe switch up your media.

"Thirteen Reasons Why, To Kill a Mockingbird on list of ‘most objected to’ books",https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/thirteen-reasons-why-to-kill-a-mockingbird-on-list-of-most-objected-to-books/story-14QMhfjDA1oBd5aJFRm63J.html,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:30:23 GMT","Before allegations of sexual harassment, Jay Asher and Sherman Alexie were facing criticisms of a different kind.

Asher’s Thirteen Reasons Why and Alexie’s The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian top the American Library Association’s list of “challenged” books from 2017, those most objected to by parents and other community members. The list also includes Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird and one of last year’s top-selling young adult novels, Angie Thomas’ The Hate U Give.

Complaints about the books range from the theme of suicide in Thirteen Reasons Why to profanity and sexual content in Alexie’s book. James LaRue, who runs the library association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom, said that future challenges could well be based on the authors themselves. Last year, Bill Cosby’s Little Bill Books were on the ALA list because of multiple accusations of sexual assault against the actor-comedian.

“I personally believe the book is distinct from the author,” LaRue said. “But when a librarian faces that kind of challenge, my advice is to treat it like any other kind of challenge. You look at the nature of the challenge, consider the context and make the decision based on the needs of the local community.”

Over the past few months, several writers have had book deals and other projects cancelled or have been kicked out of organisations. Asher was dropped by his literary agent and expelled from the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators. Alexie ended up turning down one of the library association’s highest honors, the Carnegie Medal, which had been awarded for his memoir You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me. The prize was announced in early February, just before allegations surfaced that he had harassed numerous women.

The ALA list is part of the association’s State of America’s Libraries report and marks the beginning of National Library Week, which runs through April 14. Books drawing attention, whether because of sales or a film adaptation, often become more likely to receive challenges. In 2017, Thirteen Reasons Why was adapted into a popular Netflix series, while The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian has been widely read and taught since coming out a decade ago. In previous years, Maya Angelou’s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series have been among notable challenged works.

Asher and Alexie have been on the list before; The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian topped the list for 2014, while Alexie’s book and “Thirteen Reasons Why” finished second and third, respectively, for 2012.

Books on the new list were a mix of older works such as Lee’s novel (violence, racial language) and Khaled Hosseini’s The Kite Runner (“May lead to terrorism”) and more recent books, including Cory Silverberg’s Sex is a Funny Word and I Am Jazz, by Jessica Herthel and Jazz Jennings (“Gender identity”). Three works were cited for “LGBT content”: the gay-themed penguin story And Tango Makes Three, by Peter Parnell and Justin Richardson; Alex Gino’s George; and Raina Telgemeier’s Drama.

The association tallied 356 challenges, up from 323 last year, but in line with numbers over the past decade. The ALA, which believes that reported cases are just a fraction of actual challenges, bases its list on news reports and on accounts submitted from libraries. A challenge is defined as a “formal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that materials be removed because of content or appropriateness.”

LaRue did not have a number for books actually pulled from shelves, although he cited some examples. After seven students from a Colorado community killed themselves, a school district official in 2017 ordered librarians to temporarily stop circulating Thirteen Reasons Why. An Arizona school district pulled The Kite Runner, and offered no explanation. A superintendent in Katy, Texas, pulled The Hate U Give after a man attending a school board meeting complained of the book’s language and depiction of drug use.

‘Makes me envious to see American books’: Orwell’s letter from hospital may sell for $15k,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/makes-me-envious-to-see-american-books-orwell-s-letter-from-hospital-may-sell-for-15k/story-crb5b9NyceKZ3IrS4OzAnK.html,"Mon, 09 Apr 2018 06:20:02 GMT","A three-page letter, written by the English novelist George Orwell while recovering from tuberculosis, is expected to fetch $15,000 (approx Rs 10 lakh) at an auction in the US.

Signed “George,” the letter dated March 8, 1948, was written to novelist Anthony Powell, while Orwell was admitted to the Hairmyres Hospital in Scotland. He describes his reviewing work for the Times Literary Supplement and reports on improved health having embarked on a course of streptomycin.

“I’m doing another book for the TLS (a rather dreadful anthology of recent American stuff called ‘Spearhead’). I didn’t suppose they’d send me the Mark Twain book. (By the way, after many years of trying I have at last got hold of a very rare book, Van Wyck Brooks’s ‘The Tragedy of Mark Twain,’ which he afterwards called in & reissued in a garbled version.),” Orwell wrote in the letter.

While working on the iconic novel 1984, Orwell became the first patient to receive streptomycin in Scotland. “I am a lot better. I am having a drug called streptomycin, which is a novelty in this country but is thought to be very good. It appears to be doing its stuff, though it’s too early for them to say for certain,” Orwell wrote.

Although his health at first showed improvement, he suffered severe side effects and the treatment had to be suspended after fifty days, according to US-based RR Auction. “I’ve arranged to bring out my uniform edition at the rate of a volume a year, & at present I have got six books to go in it, as I have suppressed several. I hope there’ll be others later,” Orwell wrote.

“I had always wanted to have something very sort of chaste but solid in blue buckram for about 5/-. I notice both Evelyn Waugh’s & Graham Greene’s uniform editions are very cheap-looking. They don’t seem to be able to make a book now with covers that don’t bend. It makes me very envious to see American books,” he wrote.

The review of ‘Spearhead’ that Orwell describes in the opening lines appeared in the Times Literary Supplement on April 17, 1948, and offered a long and wide-ranging review of current American poetry and prose.

Admitted to Hairmyres Hospital In July, he returned to his solitary Barnhill farmhouse on the remote Scottish island of Jura, where he completed the manuscript of 1984.

Book review: Meet the detective who can fill the gap between Sherlock Holmes and James Bond,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/book-review-meet-the-detective-who-can-fill-the-gap-between-sherlock-holmes-and-james-bond/story-AFLLCoQ9Fn4TqFOBE7A3gN.html,"Sun, 08 Apr 2018 11:08:16 GMT","The First World War is still five years away, but London is already an arena for proxy conflict between its potential European allies or adversaries — and their revolutionaries. And with the Great Detective of Baker Street having retired, and James Bond yet to come on the scene, who can Britain depend upon?

That is a question concerning an army officer in the War Office tasked with combating subversive activities. But Captain Vernon Kell has more problems than the lack of funds and support from an oblivious government, and a superior fixated on the idea that Germans are the prime threat and demanding he supply proof.

In the class-conscious British society of the Edwardian era, his biggest problem is that the staffers he has stand out in places where they have to be deployed — like a munitions factory from where plans are being stolen — are easily identified by the ruthless enemy and liquidated. Consulting Sherlock Holmes, living in retirement in the country, he is given a unique suggestion.

And in this engrossing story, H.B. Lyle finally does justice to a prominent and promising character from Holmes’ world who had not yet got a place in the sun. The once chief of the force that served as the detective’s nearly invisible but highly effective eyes and ears on the London streets — Wiggins of the Baker Street Irregulars.

But our young hero is reluctant to get back into government service after his experiences as a soldier. All that changes when his friend, a London police constable, is shot dead by a Russian anarchist after a robbery, and his own attempts to find who is responsible, among the closed, suspicious world of Russian emigres in the city, are both unsuccessful and potentially lethal.

Saved from certain death by a mysterious Russian woman, Wiggins is convinced by Holmes to help Kell and simultaneously achieve his own objective while keeping his employer in the dark about it. At the same time, seen hanging around Socialist meetings, he is also co-opted by a duo of Russian revolutionaries to help them in their own nefarious activities on behalf of their shadowy chief.

Meanwhile, Kell is not having an easy job of it, convincing his superiors that he is on the right track, but perseveres with the help of Winston Churchill, then at the start of his political career. But his time is limited until Wiggins can get something for him.

And can Wiggins, who has imbibed the Great Detective’s art of acute observation, survive in a shadowy world where few people are what they seem, killing is the simplest option, and the majestic forces of law and order may not always behind you? Can he fulfill both his tasks without losing his life in the dark streets of the city? And will he come to terms with what he finds?

Lyle, who was involved in feature films before turning to writing, skillfully spins both fact and fiction to create a tense, pulsating story that uses the frame of a murder mystery to exhibit international intrigue, history and social issues. It is not only about proxy wars and “false flag” operations, but also about a society on the brink of great political and social change. Socialism and Marxist parties pulsating story that uses the frame of a murder mystery to exhibit international intrigue, history and social issues — including those with not qualms about violence — are spreading, while women are demanding the vote as a prelude to equality.

The latter is most ably represented by Kell’s wife, a suffragist, and turning out to be better at clandestine work than her husband — forcing him to rethink most of his prevailing assumptions. Swinging between London’s high class dwellings and squalid slums, featuring Holmes and Watson, as well as real figures like Bolshevik Yakov Peters, and others, Lyle has laid the foundations of a new, engrossing series that takes up a period not very frequently focused in the thriller genre. So while Sherlock Holmes aficionados will find it quite interesting, so will a lot of others.

Review: We That Are Young by Preti Taneja,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/shakespeare-redux/story-sU1RCDfnl2zKCIfHF14NvM.html,"Sat, 07 Apr 2018 05:48:46 GMT","We That Are Young; Preti Taneja; Rs 599, 560pp; Penguin Random House

An old king unwisely decides to divide his kingdom among his three daughters based on whose declaration of love flatters him the most. The youngest, his favourite, refuses to play along and is disinherited. Thus begins King Lear, one of William Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies. As Lear comes to terms with the consequences of his actions and slowly goes mad, he learns that one must judge people by their actions and not their words. The play, of course, is much more than just the story of resentful, ungrateful children and foolish, overbearing patriarchs, and explores the larger themes of power, sanity, justice, cruelty and suffering.

Even if you have not read the original, you will enjoy Taneja’s angry, brilliant rendition of it. It features a billionaire family, is set in the India of 2012, and told from the perspectives of the so-called villains: the two wicked daughters, who, in Shakespeare’s play, drive the old King mad by throwing him out on the streets.

Devraj Bapuji, the former prince of Napurthala and founder of the largest business empire in India, is already somewhat mad with power when the novel begins. He rules over his family and business like a true despot: entertaining a hundred handpicked protégés at lavish Tuesday Parties at his palatial farmhouse, giving pompous speeches, pummeling servants when irritated, and teasing his family with juvenile mind games that feed his God Complex when not lacerating them with his ‘rakshas’ temper.

The novel, divided into five parts, is told from the point of view of the novel’s younger generation: Devraj’s three daughters – Gargi, Radha and Sita – and the two sons of his right-hand man, Ranjit: Jeet and the illegitimate son, Jivan. Devraj’s mad ramblings and reminiscences are interjected randomly throughout the five narratives though they begin to make more sense as the story races towards its predestined ghastly end.

The narrative remains faithful to the original play’s twists and turns, and recreates them organically in our ruthless, violent world. But it is the way Taneja imagines these characters (especially the daughters) and makes them familiar and relatable that turns the original on its head, without changing a single detail of the basic story.

When a young Gargi Devraj wonders why her father’s friends keep accidentally “brushing her here, or there” (Is it because their arms are “so much longer than women’s they have to”), her sister (who understands they’ve lost the lottery of gender and that her angelic beauty is her currency in this world) laughs and laughs till she cries and tells her “it’s because they can.”

Halfway through Preti Taneja’s book, Gargi Devraj Grover, 33, most obedient daughter and wife, talented, conscientious, childless, successfully shouldering the charade of a marriage she was bartered into at 18, and utterly starved of affection, has her own Time’s Up moment. Tired of collecting dead peacocks her megalomaniac father has been massacring at their farmhouse in another of his famous tantrums, and worried sick about her headstrong youngest sister who has walked out on him, she decides to stop being a bechari and give it back to him. Or as chauvinists would say, she becomes a bitch.

Like the play, Taneja’s novel starts with the return of the illegitimate son. Jivan Singh returns to Delhi from America after 15 years to find that the city of his childhood has grown exponentially, with high rises, swanky malls, flyovers and the metro, and that the rich here are above the law. That is the side he wants to be on.

Quick to unlearn his American way of life, he becomes an amoral agent of fate, a sort of detonator to the discontent and unhappiness in the lives of Devraj’s elder daughters.

Preti Taneja (Courtesy the publisher)

The novel is also a critique of contemporary India’s deep-rooted corruption, vast inequalities of wealth, social apathy, misogyny, and communalism. When Devraj begins to go mad (or madder), he does not go it alone. Through his fake anticorruption campaign, he takes the country with him as the narrative moves from Delhi to Amritsar and then to Kashmir. The original may have been written in 1606 and set in an England of an unspecified era, but it fits our times perfectly.

Taneja’s writing is fresh and lively and includes a generous bit of Hinglish. She takes the reader into the minds of each character – whether it is Jivan secretly grieving for his dead mother or a coked-up Radha trying to keep her grip on what’s happening around her – even as the narrative swirls back and forth from the continuous flow of their thoughts to the action taking place in the world around them.

At times, the need to stay true to the source material (and its vicious cruelty and absurdity) makes certain character developments and miscommunications seem forced.Still, because We That Are Young is set so close to home and offers no redemption, it is almost more disturbing than the original.","We That Are Young; Preti Taneja; Rs 599, 560pp; Penguin Random HouseAn old king unwisely decides to divide his kingdom among his three daughters based on whose declaration of love flatters him the most.

Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee, unbeknown to himself, set out on his last and fateful journey from Delhi railway station at 6.30 a.m. on 8 May 1953 as the passenger train, carrying him and his entourage to Punjab on his way to Jammu, steamed out of the station. The compartment in which he sat had been bedecked with flowers and Jana Sangh flags. Guru Datt Vaid, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Tek Chand, Balraj Madhok and a few pressmen were there with him. Shortly before his departure, he issued a statement explaining his purpose of going to Jammu, namely to find out for himself the extent and depth of the Praja Parishad agitation and the repression let loose on the citizens of Jammu by Abdullah.

Explaining why he had not applied for an entry permit, the statement said:

Mr Nehru has repeatedly declared that the accession of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to India has been hundred per cent complete. Yet it is strange to find that one cannot enter the State without a previous permit from the Government of India. This permit is granted even to Communists who are playing their usual role in Jammu and Kashmir. But entry is barred to those who think or act in terms of Indian unity and nationhood.

Regarding his aim in going to Jammu, the statement said:

My object in going to Jammu is solely to acquaint myself with what exactly had happened there and the present state of affairs. I would also come into contact with available local leaders representing various interests, outside the Praja Parishad. It will be my endeavour to ascertain what the intention of the people of Jammu is, and to find out if at all there is any possibility of the movement being brought to a peaceful and honourable end, which will be fair and just not only to the people of the State but also to the whole of India.

He was thus, contrary to what Nehru and Abdullah had sought to project, not out to provoke the agitators and take them on the path of further confrontation with Abdullah’s government. Ever the constitutional politician, he wished to bring the agitation to an end whereby both the warring parties would be able to save their faces. Only, in entering the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir he had refused to take the permit to be issued by the Government of India.

The first stop on his itinerary was nearby Ambala, in Punjab (now Haryana). While on the train, however, Dr Mookerjee remembered that before leaving Delhi he had promised Professor Walter Johnson, a visiting American dignitary, that he would send him papers on the Jana Sangh; and also more importantly, that he ought to send some official intimation to Abdullah about his entering the state. In fact, he had fixed up a meeting with Johnson on 13 May, but possibly on the apprehension that he may be arrested, also told him that he may not be able to keep the appointment. In any case, he shot off a telegram to Abdullah which read, ‘I am proceeding to Jammu. My object in going there is to study situation myself and to explore the possibilities of creating conditions leading to peaceful settlement. I will like to see you also if possible.’ He sent a copy of the telegram to Nehru.

The train reached Ambala at about 2 p.m., and there was such a huge crowd on the platform that Dr Mookerjee had a hard time getting down. Even before he got down the president of Ambala Town Jana Sangh, advocate Raghbir Saran, showed him the latest issue of the Illustrated Weekly of India 4 which carried on its cover the pictures of Dr Mookerjee and Jayaprakash Narayan with the caption, ‘After Nehru, Who? Mookerjee or J.P.?’

From Ambala he drove down to Karnal via Shahabad and Nilokheri where he had to make unscheduled stops and make speeches. From Karnal he sent a short letter to his sister-in-law Tara Devi, describing the reception he had had so far. He also expressed his worry about his dear Hasu, his younger daughter, whom he had left back in Delhi. He had a special soft corner for this one, the quiet, withdrawn girl who had never known a mother’s love, and had moreover recently recovered from a bout of tuberculosis. He spent the night at Karnal and the next day drove to Panipat and addressed a huge meeting there; then he took a train to Phagwara, where he received a reply to the telegram he had sent Abdullah. It read, ‘Thanks for your telegram. I am afraid your proposed visit to the State at the present juncture is inopportune and will not serve any useful purpose.’ Nehru did not bother to send a reply, or even an acknowledgement.

After Phagwara, the next stop was Jullundur where he addressed a press conference. He also sent back Madhok from Jullundur and boarded a train for Amritsar. In the train an elderly person introduced himself as deputy commissioner of Gurdaspur (the district in which Pathankot is situated) and told him that the Punjab government had decided not to allow him to reach Pathankot. Upon hearing this Dr Mookerjee proceeded to make arrangements for his arrest, and decided, after consultations, that Guru Datt Vaid, the well-known Ayurvedic physician and author who was then president of Delhi state Jana Sangh, and Tek Chand, a young energetic worker from Dehra Dun, would accompany him and court arrest with him. But strangely, he was not arrested, neither at Amritsar nor at Pathankot nor anywhere on the way. A huge crowd of over 20,000 received him at the Amritsar railway station where he halted for the night. He met the local workers and talked to them. He was emphatic that he would go to Jammu whether Abdullah liked it or not. The journey from Amritsar to Pathankot was yet another triumphant march. Thousands of people greeted him at every station. He arrived to an unbelievable reception at Pathankot. A sea of people with folded hands stood on both sides of the bazaar through which his jeep passed. Just before his departure a ninety-year-old lady blessed him in Punjabi with the following words: ‘Oye Puttar! Jit ke avin, aiwan na avin (My Son! Do not return until you are victorious).’

Soon after his arrival at Pathankot, the deputy commissioner of Gurdaspur, who seemed to have preceded him, sought an interview with him. He informed Dr Mookerjee that he had been instructed by his government to allow him and his companions to proceed and enter Jammu and Kashmir state without a permit.

He himself appeared quite surprised that the orders that he was due to receive had been reversed. Little did he, or anyone else present there, know that the diabolical scheme that had been hatched had it that Dr Mookerjee would be arrested in Jammu and Kashmir state and not in Punjab, so that he would remain outside the jurisdiction of the Indian Supreme Court.

The next stop was the border check post at Madhopur on the River Ravi, one of the five great rivers of the Punjab, marking the boundary between the states of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. There was a bridge across the river, and the boundary lay at the midpoint of the bridge. Dr Mookerjee and his companions reached the check post at 4 p.m. The deputy commissioner of Gurdaspur and other officers present there saw them off at the bridge. But as soon as the jeep reached the centre of the bridge, they found the road blocked by a posse of the Jammu and Kashmir state police. The jeep stopped and a police officer, who said he was the superintendent of police, Kathua, handed over to him an order of the chief secretary of the state, dated 10 May 1953, banning his entry into the state.

‘But I intend to go to Jammu,’ Dr Mookerjee declared.

Thereupon the police officer took out an order of arrest under the Public Safety Act of the state signed by Prithvinandan Singh, inspector-general of police, dated 10 May, which stated that Dr Mookerjee ‘has acted, is acting or is about to act in a manner prejudicial to public safety and peace’, and that ‘in order to prevent him from so acting . . . Captain A. Azeez, Superintendent of Police, Kathua’ was being directed to arrest Dr Mookerjee and remove him under custody to the Central Jail at Srinagar. ‘All right,’ said Dr Mookerjee on reading the order and got down from the jeep. Guru Datt Vaid, Tek Chand and others also got down.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee, his private secretary, had been with him up to this point. In his last message as a free person Dr Mookerjee told Vajpayee and others to tell the country that he had at last entered the state of Jammu and Kashmir, though as a prisoner, and to carry on his work in his absence.

The police jeep halted for a short while at Lakhanpur. The threesome was put in another closed jeep which rushed towards Srinagar through Tawi bridge and Jammu city. The people of Jammu had assembled in thousands near Tawi bridge to receive their hero. They waited for him till night but did not notice a closed jeep passing the bridge at dusk. They reached Udhampur at about 10 p.m. and Batote at about 2 a.m., slept the night there, and reached Srinagar Central Jail at about 3 p.m.

From there he and his two companions were escorted by the superintendent of the jail, Pandit Siri Kanth Sapru, to a small cottage near the Dal Lake where he, one of the most prominent members of the Indian Parliament, the president of one of India’s national parties, was to spend the last forty days of his life as a prisoner of Sheikh Abdullah, ostensibly just for having committed the offence of acting ‘in a manner prejudicial to public safety and peace’.

It is important to note here that many are under the impression that Dr Mookerjee was imprisoned for entering Jammu and Kashmir state without a permit. This is a canard deliberately spread by Sheikh Abdullah himself, as he had done in a broadcast, for reasons best known to him. Dr Mookerjee mentioned this in a handwritten note to his counsel U.M. Trivedi for the drafting of his habeas corpus petition. In fact, on 11 May the state government of Jammu and Kashmir issued an ordinance through the Sadr-i-Riyasat that it is an offence to enter the state without a state permit, but as the order of Prithvinandan Singh, inspector-general of police reveals, Dr Mookerjee was not (and could not have been) arrested under that ordinance. On the day of the arrest, the only permit that could have been issued was one by the Government of India and not by the government of Jammu and Kashmir. But as we have already seen, the deputy commissioner of Gurdaspur told him that the Government of India had already decided to allow Dr Mookerjee to enter Jammu and Kashmir state without a permit. This reveals a very strange and suspicious chain of circumstances that have been discussed later in this chapter.

…

The news of the arrest created a stir all over the country. Protests, meetings and hartals took place in Delhi and other places. This gave a new impetus and direction to the satyagraha. Satyagrahis began to proceed to Jammu without a permit and court arrest. But neither Abdullah nor Nehru was moved. Abdullah (whether with or without the consent or knowledge of Nehru, we shall never know) had a scheme up his sleeve which he was determined to follow up.

The place in which Dr Mookerjee was incarcerated was really a small cottage which was converted into a sub-jail almost in the middle of nowhere, near Nishat Bagh, far away from Srinagar city. It was situated on the slope of the mountain range flanking the Dal Lake. It could be reached only by mounting a steep flight of stairs which must have been a hard task for Dr Mookerjee with his bad leg, and proved to be much harder later. It had one main room about 10 feet by 11, in which Dr Mookerjee was lodged and two small side rooms which accommodated his co-detenues Guru Datt Vaid and Tek Chand. There was no room in this ‘sub-jail’ for a fourth bedstead. When Pandit Premnath Dogra was brought there on 19 June a tent had to be pitched in the compound outside to accommodate him. The whole compound was covered with fruit trees and vegetable beds leaving only small lawn, smaller than a tennis court, for the detenues to move about. It was at a distance of about 8 miles from the city. There was also no arrangement for adequate medical aid.

…

What a way to treat one of the most important, possibly the most important, member of the Opposition in the Indian Parliament!

Madhok states that many letters to and from him were completely suppressed. It was later discovered that Abdullah had ordered that Dr Mookerjee be given no additional facilities without his express orders. None of his friends or relatives was allowed to meet him while he was in jail. His eldest son, Anutosh, applied for a permit to visit Srinagar to see him. By that time there was a change in the rules of issue of the permit, and it had to be done by the government of Jammu and Kashmir. It was refused. Some of his relatives were in Srinagar at that time.

They too sought an interview with him but were also refused.

The only persons from outside who were taken to him for the purpose of interview were Sardar Hukam Singh, whose visit was purely political and U.M. Trivedi, barrister, who met him as his counsel. Madhok also reports that a half-mad sadhu was inflicted upon him whose nonsense he was forced to hear. It was probably done to tell the world after his death that interviews were allowed to him.

It was his long-cherished desire to write a biography of his father, and he began work on it. He also used to write his diary regularly. He took it with him to the hospital as well when he was removed there on 22 June. It would have been the most authentic source of information about his life and work, thoughts and ideals and above all his own feelings, and about the events that culminated in his tragic death. But it was kept back by the Kashmir government after his death and has still not been returned in spite of repeated requests.

On 24 May, Nehru and Dr Katju visited Srinagar for ‘rest’. They never thought to visit their august prisoner and see how he was being treated there. Later, after his death, Nehru said he had inquired about him and was told that he was in great comfort, in a ‘picturesque villa’ on the Dal Lake. ‘Being told’ was enough for Nehru.

The pain in his leg, thought to be due to varicose veins, got more severe by 3 June. In a letter dated 6 June addressed to Tara Devi, he wrote:

I was on the whole keeping well, but the pain in the right leg has again worsened during the last two days. Moreover for some days I have been running [a] temperature in the evening.

There is a burning sensation in the eyes and face. I am taking medicine. I get to eat only boiled vegetables. Fish [almost a staple food for Bengalis] is not available. The doctor has instructed me not to stand on my legs in order to give them some rest. As a result I get absolutely no exercise, and therefore lost all appetite. I wake up very early and around 5.30 a.m. I get up, go to the garden and recite the Chandi stotra . . . the whole day hangs heavy on me . . . all that I get to do is to read, recite the Bhagavad Gita, some writing.

He was feeling despondent and depressed because of the confinement and having nothing to do –– it can well be imagined what a punishment it must be for such an active person to be doing nothing from morning till night.

On the receipt of this letter in Calcutta on or about 12 June, Dr Mookerjee’s brother Justice Rama Prasad saw Dr B.C. Roy, apprised him of his health and requested him to contact Kashmir.

Dr Mookerjee always had a problem with the pain in his leg but it had never earlier been accompanied by fever. Because of loss of appetite he was getting weaker every day. Barrister U.M. Trivedi had gone to Srinagar on 12 June to argue his habeas corpus before the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. The government insisted that he would have to take instructions from him in the presence of the district magistrate. The Indian Evidence Act lays down that communication between a client and his lawyer is totally privileged and no one can be compelled to disclose it, even in court. Trivedi refused to take instructions in the presence of the district magistrate, and had to move the high court again to permit him to take instructions in private. After the high court struck down the government’s orders, Trivedi interviewed him for three hours on 18 June. He found Dr Mookerjee, who had braved so many adversities in his life, weak and cheerless.

Pandit Premnath Dogra who was taken from Jammu to Srinagar on 19 June to meet him was also struck by his poor state of health and low appetite...

The same night he developed a pain in his chest and back and a high temperature. On the morning of 20 June the authorities were informed about it. Thereupon, doctors Ali Mohammed and Amar Nath Raina reached the sub-jail at 11.30 a.m. The former diagnosed the trouble as dry pleurisy and prescribed streptomycin injections. Dr Mookerjee protested that his family physician had advised him not to take streptomycin as it did not suit his system.

But Dr Mohammed said that that was a long time back; lately a lot of new facts had come to light regarding this drug, and he need not worry. At about 3.30 p.m. the medicine was received and the jail doctor administered one full gram of the medicine into Dr Mookerjee. In addition he was also administered some powder, possibly some painkiller (no prescription was made available to anyone), which, Dr Mohammed said, was to be taken twice a day, but could be taken up to six times if the pain persisted or became severe. According to Guru Datt Vaid, Dr Mookerjee requested the superintendent of the jail on that day to send thenews of his illness to his relatives. But no such intimation was sent nor any bulletin issued by the government till after his death.

The next day, on 21 June, excepting the jail doctor who was only an assistant surgeon, no other doctor, not even Dr Mohammed, visited him. The jail doctor administered another one gram of streptomycin. His temperature rose and the pain increased during the day.

…

At about 4.45 a.m. on 22 June an attendant woke up Vaid and told him that Dr Mookerjee wanted to see him immediately.

Vaid rushed to his room and found that his temperature had gone down to 97° F and he had perspired profusely. He felt his pulse and found it very feeble. He administered him some hot cardamom tea and clove water which gave him some relief. Dr Mookerjee told him that he had slept fairly well till about 4 a.m., when he woke up and felt a severe pain in his chest and had broken into a sweat. He was also feeling so giddy that he thought he would lose consciousness. He thought he should not disturb anyone at that ungodly hour, but was progressively feeling so weak that he was forced to wake up Vaid. Apparently he had had a severe heart attack, a myocardial infarction as it is medically known––possibly the second or third one after the ones he had in 1945 at Barrackpore (see Chapter 7).

At 5.15 a.m. the jail superintendent was informed about his deteriorating health and was requested to come with a doctor immediately. Dr Ali Mohammed reached there at 7.30 a.m. He suggested to the superintendent that Dr Mookerjee should be immediately removed to the nursing home….’

Meanwhile Trivedi came to see him at about 10 a.m. At that time Dr Mookerjee was propped up in bed, and Trivedi found him in a good mood. They had discussions about his case for about an hour.

At about 11.30 a.m. the jail superintendent reached there with a taxi (not an ambulance), and they walked down the steep steps from his room to the taxi. Dr Mookerjee was removed, not to any nursing home but to the gynaecological ward in the state hospital about 10 miles away. He was kept in a room on the first floor (probably he was made to walk up the stairs). One Dr Jagannath Zutshi, a house surgeon, was detailed to look after him, though not exclusively.

What took place in the hospital is still shrouded in mystery. Barrister Trivedi came to see him at 5.30 p.m. after completing his arguments in the court. Justice Killam was hearing the matter. Trivedi was confident that Dr Mookerjee would be set at liberty the next day when the judgment was to be delivered.

Trivedi said later that he did not find him the way he found him in the morning, but Dr Mookerjee said he was feeling better than in the morning. … Trivedi stayed with him till about 7.15 p.m. and asked the attending doctor what his true medical state was. The doctor reassured him by saying that there was no immediate cause for concern. As he was about to leave, Dr Mookerjee asked him to get him some reading material of his choice. Trivedi shook hands with him trying to feel his temperature, which he found to be normal.

There was a nurse on duty in the room and some policemen on duty outside. Trivedi asked for permission to visit him at 9 a.m. on 23 June, but the doctor told him that his X-ray was scheduled at 9 a.m., so he should come and see him at 8 a.m.

That was the last time Trivedi saw Dr Mookerjee alive.

When he left at about 7.30 p.m., Dr Mookerjee was weak but cheerful. Doctors in attendance told Trivedi that the worst had passed and that he would be X-rayed next morning and would be all right in two or three days.

But on 23 June at about 3.45 a.m. Trivedi was told by the police superintendent that Dr Mookerjee was in a bad state and the district magistrate had asked him to be at his bedside immediately.

He was picked up from his hotel to go to the hospital. Pandit Premnath Dogra and the two co-detenues of Dr Mookerjee in the sub-jail, Guru Datt and Tek Chand, were also asked about the same time to get ready to go to the hospital. They reached there about 4 a.m. and were informed that Dr Mookerjee had breathed his last at 3.40 a.m.

This is what Madhok wrote about his last days in his lifesketch titled The Portrait of a Martyr and Guru Datt Vaid and barrister U.M. Trivedi said in statements made on 25 June.

Apparently, when Dr Mookerjee had made known his intention to visit Jammu, Sucheta Kripalani paid him a visit. Sucheta, it would be remembered, was Bengali, and had married Acharya J.B. Kripalani, and had assisted Gandhi during his visit to pogrom-affected Noakhali in 1946 (see Chapter 8). This is what Madhok said (on tape):

Sucheta Kripalani had told him, so many others had told him, that you won’t go, Nehru will not allow you to return safe from there. Dr Mookerjee told Sucheta, ‘I have no personal enmity against Nehru, I am working for a cause, why should he have any vendetta for me?’ Then Sucheta told Dr Mookerjee, ‘You don’t know Nehru, I know Nehru, he looks upon you as his main rival and he will try to remove you from the field if he can and he is capable of anything.’

Madhok was not explicit as to whether he had heard this conversation with his own ears. Quite possibly Sucheta spoke in Bengali, which Madhok does not follow.

And then again, on tape:

So, when Trivedi was staying in Nedou’s Hotel, one day a Pandit came to him. He said, ‘I am a Jyotishi [astrologer], Dr Mookerjee is not going to return safe, please get him released as early as possible’ . . . In the same evening, a police officer came, he said, ‘I am so and so, but please don’t disclose my identity, Sheikh Abdullah has a plan, Dr Mookerjee may not be allowed . . . [inaudible]. His habeas corpus is being discussed today. Please see that you get the judgment tonight itself.’ He insisted that [the] judgment is going to be given today, and you see, that he is probably going to be released, that is, judgment is given today itself and he is released.

This biographer had also interviewed Sabita Banerjee, Dr Mookerjee’s eldest daughter, at her flat in Koregaon Park, Pune, on 24 April 2010, and she had a somewhat different tale to tell. She was a widow at that time, about eighty-four, but perfectly fit, absolutely lucid and used to live all by herself with only a help. Her daughter Manju lived in another flat in the same block of buildings. Her interview was transcribed and got checked by her. She died about a year later. This is what she had to tell about the last days of her father.

After Dr Mookerjee’s death his eldest son Anutosh asked for a permit to visit Kashmir. In the application one has to always mention one’s father’s name, and presumably for that reason his request for a permit was refused. Then Sabita and her husband, Nishith, decided to visit Kashmir in his place, but quietly, posing as tourists, with their two children. They did not apprehend any trouble [and they did not have any] because then, in married women’s applications, the husband’s name and not the father’s name was mentioned.

They had a nerve-racking experience there. They had decided, for fear of trouble and possible arrest, that they would not reveal their identity. They took up residence in a big houseboat on the Jhelum. A friend of Dr Mookerjee from his days in London, one Jatindra Nath Majumdar, happened to be visiting Kashmir at the time, also as a tourist. He came to visit the Banerjees in their houseboat, and they were chatting in Bengali when a bearer of the houseboat came to serve tea.

Majumdar mentioned Dr Mookerjee in front of the bearer and asked her if she had seen the house where he had lived. Sabita winked at him so as to suggest that he should shut up, but she was still secure in the belief that the bearer would not understand anything as he did not know Bengali. As soon as Majumdar left the bearer asked them if they knew Dr Mookerjee. She said they didn’t and that they were talking about him only because he was Bengali. The bearer said that he could show them the house where Dr Mookerjee spent his last days. And he did.

They took a taxi to a hillock by the side of the Dal Lake, and climbed up the stairs to the sub-jail at the top of the hillock, she all the while feeling how her dear Bapi [father] must have felt with his bad leg when he was forced to climb those steps. It was a small isolated bungalow at the top of the hill, windswept and forlorn. In the sub-jail they found three cots in one room, side by side. Sabita asked the bearer about the whereabouts of the doctor who treated him in his last days. The bearer refused to divulge anything, but said that he could take them to a person who had been there when he died. Possibly Miss Rajdulari Tikkoo, his regular nurse at the gynaecological ward at the state hospital. Dr Mookerjee always insisted on a Hindu nurse.

They went to her house in Srinagar. Two women were living there, the nurse and her mother. As soon as Sabita revealed her identity the nurse said she would not say anything and asked them to leave. By now the Banerjees were extremely emotionally charged. Sabita burst into tears, and begged the nurse to tell her, saying that she would never reveal her name.

Then the nurse gave it all out.

Dr Mookerjee had fallen ill and was taken to the ‘maternity home’ as she described it. There, on his last day, she was on duty. He was sleeping. The doctor left, leaving instructions that whenever he woke up he was to be administered an injection, for which he left an ampoule with the nurse. After some time he did wake up, and [she said to Sabita, ‘I don’t know why I did it’] she pushed that injection. As soon as she did it, Dr Mookerjee started tossing about, shouting at the top of his voice, ‘Jal jata hai, humko jal raha hai (I’m burning up, I’m burning).’ ‘I rushed to the telephone to tell the doctor and ask for instructions.’ He said, ‘Theek hai, sab theek ho jaiga (It is all right, he will be all right).’ Meanwhile Dr Mookerjee had fallen into a stupor. And that was the end of him.

Then she said, ‘I have committed a great sin, and I had to tell it to you. But I will leave this house immediately, because you will get back to Calcutta, and talk about this, and all what I told you is bound to get out. Then I’ll be murdered.’ In fact that is what she did. The next day when Sabita and Nishith went to look her up both the mother and the daughter were gone. The nurse had refused to give her name.

According to a report printed in the Organiser on 20 July 1953 and translated and reproduced in Uma Prasad’s book, Rajdulari Tikkoo, the nurse, tried to get hold of a doctor when Dr Mookerjee’s condition became critical but no doctor was available. Tikkoo then asked an orderly called Noor Ahmed to fetch Dr Zutshi. Dr Zutshi came immediately, and telephoned Dr Ali Mohammed for instructions. Meanwhile Dr Mookerjee’s condition deteriorated further and he died at about 2.15 a.m., not 3.40 a.m. Dr Mohammed arrived about half an hour after his death. The source of this report is not mentioned.

The communiqué issued after his death by the Kashmir government on 23 June, gave the report of doctors Ali Mohammed and Ram Nath Parhar, who were said to have been attending upon him…

The aircraft, with its sad cargo… reached Dum Dum airport in Calcutta around 8.55 p.m. amid cries of his relatives, friends and admirers.... A sea of humanity besieged the body, and the truck carrying it could reach 77 Asutosh Mookerjee Road only as late as 4 a.m., seven hours later, a distance normally covered in less than an hour….The fifty-second birthday of the departed leader was just two weeks away, on 6 July.

That night many people slept on the road in front of 77 Asutosh Mookerjee Road, waiting for the body to arrive. The next day saw a deluge of humanity accompanying the body from the house to the Keoratala cremation ground, near Kalighat…

Dr Mookerjee’s eldest son, Anutosh, followed by others of the family, did the mukhagni, the ritual touching of the flame to his mouth. And then the pyre was lit and the body finally consigned to flames. And thus ended prematurely, even before he was fifty-two, the journey of the great man who could have saved the country from many of the ills that overtook it in the subsequent years.","‘But I intend to go to Jammu,’ Dr Mookerjee declared.

Syama Prasad Mookerjee; Life and Times by Tathagata Roy; Rs 599, 450pp; Penguin

Syama Prasad Mookerjee was the founder of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the predecessor of the Bharatiya Janata Party. He is undoubtedly one of the most iconic and controversial leaders in India’s recent history. In spite of his significant political and ideological differences with Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr Mookerjee was inducted into the first cabinet of independent India. However, following the Delhi Pact between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan, Dr Mookerjee resigned from the cabinet. His role during the Great Bengal Famine of 1943 and the Great Calcutta Killings and Naokhali Carnage of 1946 was historic. His premature death in custody - in Kashmir - remains one of the unsolved mysteries of India’s political history.

Dr Mookerjee was an educationist, politician and patriot who often opposed the official narratives of his time but fought consistently for India’s independence and pre-eminent position in the world. His life has remained largely unexplored until now. This book aims to rectify that omission by examining his life in detail and shedding light on the turbulent and contentious events of his times.*

THE RTI STORY BY ARUNA ROY WITH THE MKSS COLLECTIVE



The RTI Story by Aruna Roy with the MKSS Collective; 375pp, Rs 495; Roli Books

Aruna Roy resigned from the IAS in 1975 to work with peasants and workers in rural Rajasthan. In 1990 she helped co-found the Mazdooor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS). The MKSS struggles in the mid-90s for wages and other rights gave birth to the now celebrated Right to Information movement. Aruna continues to be a part of many democratic struggles and campaigns.

This book is a collective history that tells the story of how ordinary people can come together and prevail against great odds, to make democracy more meaningful.*

RITUSAMHARAM BY KALIDASA; TRANSLATED BY AND HAKSAR

Ritusamharam by Kalidasa; Translated by AND Haksar; Rs 399, 178pp; Penguin

Perhaps the most lively and exuberant of Kalidasa’s extant works, Ritusamharam is a glorious ode to nature’s bounty and the enduring emotional response it evokes in mankind as a whole.

Watch: Cricket, the biography of a neglected politician, and the story of RTI on #Bookstack this week

Recounted as a celebration of the passing seasons, it is a feast for the senses, capturing the myriad facets of love and longing in a kaleidoscope of sumptuous imagery: the mischievous moonlight that, like a pining lover, steals glances at sleeping maidens; the monsoon-bloated rivers that rush to the sea with a lustful urgency; the flame of lovemaking that is kindled anew at the onset of winter; the heady scent of mango blossoms that makes even the most unyielding of hearts quiver. Even animals, big and small, are swept into the playful pattern of the great poet’s lyrical homage.

Subroto Bagchi is admired and respected for co-building a one-office, one-country IT startup to an Indian MNC with 43 offices in 17 countries in fewer than 20 years. He is an author too and this book is a treasure chest. Bagchi calls himself a “salesperson” and generously recounts personal experiences from across the world, sharing lessons learnt, insights gained, wisdom gleaned from dozens of clients to whom he’s personally sold the services offered by his company. He knows his onions since he’s cooked them himself or sometimes been cooked!

According to Bagchi selling is also about magic, and he’s met quite a few wizards. Indeed, Sell casts its own spell because it is replete with the author’s encounters with wizards among salespeople and he’s spelt (pun intended!) out their wisdom for readers.

This book on salespersonship could well have been conceived and delivered as a handbook or perhaps textbook targeted at thousands of students eager to rote-learn sales techniques. Mercifully, the author abandoned such temptation and delivered a work that’s as far away as possible from a “How To” product. Each of the book’s 30 chapters carries a serious moral or, using jargon, sales mantra. Bagchi’s crisp narration is compelling. Lessons in the art, science and witchcraft of selling are tantalisingly camouflaged in parables unfurled with an accomplished raconteur’s panache.

Consider this edited excerpt. “I found myself in Silicon Valley. My task was to entice tech companies in the Valley to award R&D assignments to us. It was a time when most executives in American companies didn’t know where India was.” It took months for Bagchi to win a big multi-year business basket. “When I look back, that win is one of the major factors that eventually shaped my destiny.” The moral: Never give up cold calling because the process keeps your spirit of inquiry alive.

Or take this valuable insight: In sales you need to focus on three things – physics, chemistry and maths. Physics is the matter, the form and function, the price of what you sell. Chemistry is the relationship you build with the customer. Maths is revenue and profit that come from what the customer pays you. In this triad, it’s chemistry that’s most important. If that isn’t in place, you won’t succeed. Countless examples abound where wrong chemistry brought about the downfall of good products, great pricing notwithstanding. Moral: Use the chemistry to improve the physics to deliver the maths!

And then there’s this humdinger on coping with failure: “In sales, we obsess about winning. In truth, the scope to improve, to innovate, to break new ground requires us to fail. But even as we deal with failure, we gloss over them. In typical sales meets and conferences, wins are given exaggerated attention, losses are quickly buried under justifications and pointless blame games. To keep the big picture at the centre of one’s vision, one has to develop a reflective space, the ability to step back and be authentic. Finally, there may always be failure that needs to be handled; the point is to handle it with tact, poise and brilliance.”

Sell contains many delicious anecdotes that proffer insights and morals. However, the book’s own sales pitch is affected by some proof-reading and copy-editing shortcomings. To read ‘gauge’ as ‘guage’ hurts one’s eyes.

But let’s not bother. As a seminal volume, Sell stands tall on its own merit. Subroto Bagchi has contributed hugely to uplifting the quality of contemporary Indian management literature. We need more books as valuable as this one.

Review: Mothering a Muslim by Nazia Erum,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/review-mothering-a-muslim-by-nazia-erum/story-2b2XNVzPJ5tN1d8sNkuTbO.html,"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 12:18:57 GMT","Mothering a Muslim – The Dark Secret in Our Schools and Playgrounds ; Nazia Erum; 220pp, Rs 399; Juggernaut

It’s easy to judge this book by its cover. After all, the title couldn’t be more direct – Mothering a Muslim: The Dark Secret in Our Schools and Playgrounds. So either you’re driven to read the book because your values will not allow you to escape another sad reality of life. Or you ignore it because you’re feeling burdened by those same sad realities, and are only looking for entertainment. Or you scoff at it because, look at those terrorists, first they kill people and blow things up, then they whine.

If you fall in the third category of reader I described above, you need to understand one thing: it’s people like you who drove the author, fashion professional Nazia Erum, to look at the precious newborn in her arms and give her little girl a name that does not identify her with the religion she was born into. This in the hope that Myra will grow up not bullied for being a beef eater, not taunted for the existence of ‘Islamic terror’, not reviled as an enemy of the country that is her home, and never lynched for the mere fact that she is a Muslim. Since you are one of the people who actually caused this book to exist, it really would make sense for you to read it.

All’s not well?: Kids are being subjected to systemic othering in schools. (Sanjeev Verma/HT Photo)

But this rant is mine alone. It is not at all how Nazia Erum approached her subject. For a book that speaks of increased religion-based bullying and systemic othering in schools and playgrounds particularly since 2014, Mothering a Muslim is not about blame. It’s about insights. As Erum says in her introduction, after her daughter was born, “I wanted to know whether a Muslim mother’s worries were any different from that of her Hindu, Christian or Sikh counterparts. What were the challenges that were exclusively hers?”

This question led Erum to interview 145 Muslim middle class families across 12 cities over a year. Much emerged about Islamophobia in schools and colleges. But almost as much emerged about prejudices against almost all other minorities, prejudices within the Muslim community itself, the impact of ‘Islamic terror’ on ordinary Muslims, and the age-old tension between traditional community ideals and personal values. All in all, I found more to think about in this very slim book than I have in any other of this nature.

Watch: Disturbing stories inside elite schools of Delhi

For instance, there’s the question of blame. As one mother pointed out to Erum in an interview, how do you tell your child that her tormentor at school is just a child? ‘Just a child’ implies that a child cannot really understand the things she says and does. Yet, the child at the receiving end knows exactly what’s going on. Of the 118 Muslim families with children aged between five and 20 that Erum interviewed in Delhi/NCR, 100 said they’d been called ‘terrorist’ and/or ‘Pakistani’. Many were bewildered and hurt. Others shrugged and said this was the Muslim equivalent of Sardar jokes. Yet others pointed out how Dalits and other sections of Indian society face worse. But when 85 per cent of 118 children from one community have been called terrorists or enemies of the state, it’s time to figure out what is going on, how, why, and what could be done about it.

The schools these children go to or went to are all recognisable as ‘good’, and are apparently progressive in ideals and attitude. But Erum’s interviews showed something most people don’t think about. As entities, the schools may have cosmopolitan values, but the teachers they hire may not. And schools do not often react in a positive manner – or any manner – to complaints of religion-based bullying. Which is why many children and parents don’t complain at all.

But, in fact, as Erum discovered in Bhopal, religious discrimination can run deeper in the education system than anyone believed. Take the elective third language classes that all schools must offer. Sanskrit is one of the electives. In Bhopal, Urdu is another. Usually, students move out of their sections to attend their elective classes. But in Bhopal, students who take Urdu (mostly Muslim) are all in one section, and students who take Sanskrit (mostly Hindu) are all together in another. This means that though Muslims and Hindus attend the same school, they grow up only knowing each other as ‘the other section’. They don’t share tiffins. They don’t have friends from other communities. “Most of our friends are non-Muslims,” one of Erum’s interviewees told her. “My best friend is a Pandit. But my children only have Muslim friends.”

I could go on for another 5,000 words at least about what I learned from Mothering a Muslim, but frankly I’d rather you read the book than just a review of it. If I said I loved it, it would be hollow: this is not the kind of book you can love. But I read this book to review it, and I wound up reviewing not only the book, but myself, my family, my community, and my country. I can’t think of any other book I’ve read with such an impact.

Here’s the secret code to writing a best-seller: Publish your book in the festive season,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/here-s-the-secret-code-to-writing-a-best-seller-publish-your-book-in-the-festive-season/story-CO3gp2nDyKOjO8IbHxCN0H.html,"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 08:57:12 GMT","Books that are fiction, thrillers or mysteries, have high initial sales numbers and are more likely to be bestsellers if released around Christmas, according to a study.

Researchers from Northeastern University in the US used a big data approach to investigate what makes a book successful. By evaluating data from the New York Times Bestseller Lists from 2008 to 2016, they developed a formula to predict if a book would be a bestseller.

They found that general fiction and biographies were more likely to make the bestseller list more often than other genres. Those with a higher initial place on the list were more likely to stay on it for a longer amount of time, researchers said.

Books in the romance category were more likely to be written by women and men were more likely to be authors of non-fiction. Researchers found no gender disparity among best-selling fiction authors, but most non-fiction best sellers were written by men.

“The most surprising result was that we found a universal pattern to book sales: all hardcover bestsellers, regardless of genre, follow a sales trajectory governed by the same factors,” said Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, a professor at Northeastern University.

“This allowed us to create a statistical model to predict sales of a book based on its early sales numbers,” said Barabasi, lead author of the study published in the journal EPJ Data Science.

The researchers found that although fiction books sold more copies than non-fiction books, non-fiction titles were more likely to retain their bestseller status once achieved. An example of this was Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand, a non-fiction title that stayed on the bestseller list for 203 weeks, longer than any other book in the study, researchers said.

The fiction title that stayed on the list the longest was The Help, which stayed for 131 weeks; this may have been due to a popular film adaption, they said. The researchers also found that fiction writers had more repeat success with getting on the list than non-fiction writers.

Books in the romance category were more likely to be written by female authors and male authors were more likely to be authors of non-fiction books.

The researchers found no gender disparity among bestselling fiction authors, but most non-fiction bestsellers were written by men. They evaluated sales numbers and patterns from 2,468 fiction titles and 2,025 non-fiction titles from the New York Times Bestseller Lists 2008-2016 to create their formula for predicting how well a book would sell and whether it would be a bestseller.

Man Booker International Prize reverts author’s nationality to Taiwan after outcry,https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/man-booker-international-prize-reverts-author-s-nationality-to-taiwan-after-outcry/story-6wwPzGhN9MHUomCnanSW9M.html,"Wed, 04 Apr 2018 12:44:02 GMT","The Man Booker International Prize has reversed a move to change a Taiwanese author’s nationality to “Taiwan, China”, after the literary award was criticised for bowing to pressure from Beijing.

Wu Ming-yi – whose novel The Stolen Bicycle was among the 13 books longlisted for the prestigious prize – had protested after his nationality on the Man Booker website was revised from “Taiwan” to “Taiwan, China”.

The 2018 longlist on the Man Booker Prize website with Wu Ming-yi’s corrected nationality.

The change was prompted by a complaint from the Chinese embassy in Britain, according to the London-based award organiser Booker Prize Foundation. Taiwan is a self-ruled democracy but China views it as part of its territory, to be brought back under its control using force if necessary.

Beijing rejects any recognition of Taiwan’s sovereignty and has recently rebuked foreign firms – including Zara, Marriott, and Delta – for listing Taiwan as a separate country on their websites.

But the organisers said on April 4 the Prize has decided to change Wu’s nationality back to “Taiwan” after consulting interested parties and the British government.

“The country/territory of longlisted authors and translators will appear, and Wu Ming-yi will be listed as ‘Taiwan,’“ the Booker Prize Foundation said in a statement.

In what may be a compromise, “territory” was a new addition to the Man Booker International Prize nominee list appearing on its website on Wednesday.

“The prize is not about defining nationality; all global citizens are eligible, provided they are published in translation in the UK,” it added.

The foundation has notified the Chinese embassy but did not consult with them. Taiwan’s foreign ministry thanked Man Booker for the reversal and criticised Beijing.

“China is putting pressure on Taiwan’s international space on all fronts and at all times, both in official and civil situations,” the ministry said. Wu’s novel, written in Chinese and translated into English, is about a novelist searching for his missing father’s bicycle.

The shortlist for the prize will be announced on April 12 and winner on May 22.

Meet the man behind the 170 catchy jingles at Japan’s train stations,https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/meet-the-man-behind-the-170-catchy-jingles-at-japan-s-train-stations/story-VLz5L3DYkIq3UaB8wJef2L.html,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:08:19 GMT","Minoru Mukaiya is one of the world’s most played musicians, with millions of people across Japan listening to his songs every day -- but most of them don’t even notice. Mukaiya is a composer of “Hassha Merodii” or “train departure melodies”, short jingles that whisk commuters on their way at some of the world’s busiest stations. Almost no one would know his most famous track by name, a catchy electronic ditty broadcast for departures from platforms three and four at Tokyo’s Shibuya station -- the world’s third busiest -- but millions have it on their brains for hours after their commute.

Asked how many train jingles he has created, the 61-year-old former keyboard player with the jazz-fusion band Casiopea pauses. He has lost count and an assistant rushes over with a list. “170? What? I wrote 170,” he says, exploding with laughter. “That can’t be right!” “Hassha Merodii” is so common now in Japan that locals are unfazed when the sharp twang of an electronic keyboard or an organ’s trill spills out of a loudspeaker but tourists are often thrilled.

Millions of people across Japan listen to ""hassha merodie"" on loud speakers every day on the train platforms -- but most of them don't even notice. (AFP)

Nevertheless, Mukaiya’s work has attracted a cult following. He has more than 34,000 Twitter followers, performs the ditties at concerts to thousands of screaming fans and is now banned from playing at Ginza station -- the epicentre of Tokyo swank -- after a live show there sparked pandemonium. Fans tell him the music is “good for their health, for their work, for walking. It warms them up” after a hard commute to the office, Mukaiya told AFP in an interview in his music room. “I want them to be happy.”

‘Mountain train’

“Hassha Merodii” started when train operators were looking for ways to make their stations stand out and came up with the idea of a catchy jingle. The songs are capped at seven seconds -- the “dwell time” train operators have to cram people into packed commuter trains and still, famously, run on time. A spokesman for the JR East train company told AFP they were introduced “to prevent passengers from dashing onto the train”.

But despite the short timeframe, Mukaiya says that each ditty packs in a story. In Japan’s ancient capital Kyoto, “we have a deep respect for culture, so the song sounds more respectful of Japanese culture,” he explained, sandwiched between musical instruments and computer screens. The rapturous crescendo and rising pitch in Shibuya station’s departure song, on the other hand, is a nod to the train’s uphill journey to the next platform.

“The Toyoko line used to be up the stairs on a very high level. But now the Toyoko line has moved to the subway, and the journey from Shibuya to the next station is a very steep slope,” he says. “So I thought the departure song... needs to make it feel like the mountain train.”

Other jingles nod to local history. The station at Takadanobaba, the home to popular anime series Astro Boy, pays homage to the cartoon with a jingle version of the show’s theme tune. And Osaka station features a soundbite of “I guess I really do love you”, one of the region’s most famous songs. One of the distinguishing features of Mukaiya’s work is that the individual tunes at each station along a line can be combined to form a coherent song.

‘Science fiction world’

The jingles have allowed Mukaiya to combine his two passions, music and trains. His interest in railways was first kindled as an eight-year-old when Japan’s first ever Shinkansen bullet train glided into Tokyo Station a week before the 1964 Olympics. “I thought that this is a kind of science fiction world,” he said. Two decades later, he released one of the world’s first train simulator video games for fellow enthusiasts, amassing a huge following and nabbing the attention of industry stalwarts like PlayStation.

The game was so realistic that train operators around the country started asking Mukaiya to design something similar to teach their conductors and drivers. He even designed a life-sized mock-up of a train conductor’s compartment -- complete with control panel -- that occupies pride of place in his office. Staring out to an imaginary platform, he rings a bell -- confirming the train is clear to leave -- and assumes his position at the wheel, watching the monitor above for the traffic light to turn green before taking off. When the train pulls into the next station he walks back over to the carriage door, grinning. A makeshift platform projected from overhead, the number 10 appearing at his feet. He has lined up the train doors with the platform exit perfectly.

Dinosaur skeletons become trendy interior design objects.

Cage, however, did hand back the rare skull of a tyrannosaurus bataar, a close cousin of T. rex, that he bought in 2007 after it was found to have been stolen and illegally taken out of Mongolia. Dinosaur bones are increasingly gracing collectors’ cabinets, with another huge skeleton, that of a theropod, expected to fetch up to 1.5 million euros ($1.84 million) when it goes up for auction in June.

Chinese buyers

“For the last two or three years the Chinese have become interested in palaeontology and have been looking for big specimens of dinosaurs found on their soil, for their museums or even for individuals,” Briano said. The new buyers are now bidding against multinational corporations as well as ultra-rich Europeans and Americans, the “traditional” buyers of dinosaur skeletons, Briano added.

The price goes up if the skeleton shows traces of a fight or an incurable illness, as well as if it is considered rare, has a high percentage of verified bones, or a particularly impressive skull. (AFP)

In 1997, McDonald’s and Walt Disney were among donors stumping up $8.36 million to buy Sue -- the most complete and best preserved Tyrannosaurus rex ever found -- for the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. “Millions of people come to see it, it’s incredible publicity for companies,” said Eric Mickeler, a natural history expert for the Aguttes auction house. Palaeontologists acknowledge that many fossils that go on the block are of limited scientific interest, but important specimens do go up for auction and can, as in Sue’s case, be bought through acts of patronage. The market remains small and “isn’t for everybody”, Mickeler said. Only around five dinosaurs are put up for auction around the world every year.

‘People like the teeth’

The allosaurus which goes on sale Wednesday, among 87 lots of natural artefacts, is considered “small” at 3.8 metres (12.5 feet) long. It is expected to fetch up to 650,000 euros, while the diplodocus -- despite being bigger at 12 metres long from nose to tail -- has a guide price of 450,000 to 500,000 euros. Carnivores like the allosaurus often fetch more than herbivores. “People like the teeth,” Mickeler said. The price also goes up if the skeleton shows traces of a fight or an incurable illness, as well as if it is considered rare, has a high percentage of verified bones, or a particularly impressive skull.

“We recently sold a very beautiful piece to a Venetian family, they have a magnificent big room in which the dinosaur is perfectly at ease,” Briano said. But Ronan Allain, a palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum of Paris, denounced “completely nonsensical” prices. “It’s the luxury world, it’s not for people like us,” he said. “We could decide to buy it pre-emptively, but for the theropod, for example, that would mean shelling out more than a million,” he said.

A comedy play about the bragging affliction to be staged in the Capital,https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/a-comedy-play-about-the-bragging-affliction-to-be-staged-in-the-capital/story-sTFZcOZeBuYkva1J0UskNM.html,"Sun, 08 Apr 2018 11:04:09 GMT","In today’s virtual world, happy posts and pictures on social media are often uploaded to seek envy of foes and friends alike. So, in the real world, when two childhood friends speak to each other after many years, their conversations become highly exaggerated. Besides talking about the grandness of their houses in exaggerated proportions, as well as about their careers, they also brag about their husbands and their looks. And that’s how the upcoming play by Navras Theatre Group derives its title Mera Pati Salman Khan.

“The peer pressure in society to show off is so much that it takes us away from our real identity,” says Raj Upadhyay, director of the play. He adds that the bragging attitude is noticed more amongst the metro dwellers: “Delhi has this culture where a lot of other forces decide what or who we are. The play raises some serious question about our state, such as how lonely we are, and how we fail to connect with ourselves. The two female protagonists in the play — one from Delhi and the other from Mumbai — that everything they have is better than the other, including their husbands. That’s where the problem starts…”

A female actor’s voice is heard from the stage, where the group is rehearsing, and dialogues ridiculing the male protagonists’ looks and personality bring a smile on the face. “The serious issue of being distanced from reality will be presented through a comic narrative because comedy is what entertains people, and we, as a group, believe that theatre must entertain while educating,” says protagonist of the play Rashmi Vaidialingam, who is also a lawyer and Indian classical dancer.

My character of a CBI officer is a surprise element,” chips in Ganesh Seth, play’s co-producer. The group’s annual production will this time bring together about 12 veteran actors and younger theatre enthusiasts. Kimti Anand – who was recently seen as Pradhan in Akshay Kumar-starrer Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017) — will portray the character of a Haryanvi uncle in this play. Anand says, “I performed the first play for this group in 1962, and have been coming back every year for their annual production. The kick of performing on the stage and the opportunity to interact and learn from youngsters is what keeps bringing me back.”

Indian landscapes in Chinese-style brushwork,https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/indian-landscapes-in-chinese-style-brushwork/story-wsK8Z9TPG2k3vmgmeK8ktO.html,"Sun, 08 Apr 2018 10:31:14 GMT","Water bodies, trees, boats, flowers, and other elements of Indian landscapes are set to acquire a new meaning in an exhibition Emotions In Colour, which will showcase watercolour paintings by artist Nandita Bhattacharya. And her canvas for these artworks? Chinese rice paper using Chinese watercolours, and Chinese-style brushwork.

“Chinese painting is stroke-based. If I want to paint a coconut tree, I will require a different kind of brush stroke than the stroke required to paint a rose flower. Also, since I use thin Chinese watercolour to paint, I have to paint every petal in a single stroke,” says Bhattacharya, whose 12” by 24” works will be exhibited along with artworks by Kolkata-based artists Ananda Gopal Roy and Swati Roy.

One of the artworks by Nandita Bhattacharya, which will be displayed at the exhibition in Delhi.

Bhattacharya, who uses this technique of art to explore the various moods of Indian rural landscapes at different times of the day and in different seasons, learnt this style at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Singapore. “Chinese painters constantly update themselves. My teachers still visit China to learn new painting techniques, and I visit them to update myself. If I have to paint an Indian Mogra flower, I try to create it using my own style, and then get it approved by my teacher,” she says.

The beauty of Chinese-style paintings is attained after overcoming challenges, which include gaining expertise in painting on rice paper. “Rice paper is very thin and delicate. It has a tendency to tear up easily. Also, Chinese painting is freestyle. So, I don’t do a sketch. I paint directly. And even if I try to draw it first with a pen or a pencil, it will be impossible to hide those lines with colours, because the thin Chinese watercolours will make the pencil lines more prominent,” adds Bhattacharya.

Wonder how the colours merge beautifully on the rice paper vis a vis canvas? “The Chinese watercolours are minerals extracted from the mountains in China. They are tiny pieces of rocks that are scrubbed with water to produce colours used to paint.”

“The aim of the event is to promote the local food and culture of the fringe villagers. It is an attempt to create a model of alternative livelihood through food, handloom and culture,” Mitali from Food Sutra, one of the organisers, said.

“We are expecting participation of over 300 domestic and foreign tourists in the two-day festival.”

The festival has been organised, among others, by Indian Weavers’ Association and the Swankar Mithinga Onsai Afat, an association of reformed poachers in Manas who are now engaged in wildlife conservation and preservation.

The National park which is also a tiger and rhino reserve covers five districts of Assam - Kokrajhar, Baksa, Chirang, Udalguri and Barpeta. Residents of fringe villages that dot the National Park are all set to give the tourists an experience of a lifetime by offering them a peek into their rural lives.

Saumar.J. Sharma of the Indian Weavers’ Association said: “We have trained about 32 households about maintenance of hygiene and the basics of the service industry. We trained them on managing home stays and serving the guests home made food.

“When the locals start keeping guests in their home stays, it will not only provide then with an alternative livelihood but also direct market linkages to showcase and sell their products.

“Normally in Assam, the tourist season is for six months (April to November). However, with these initiatives, the locals can host interested travellers during the off season or all through the year.”

On Saturday, there will be a session of celebrity cooking with renowned chef Gautam Mehrishi and food blogger Kalyan Karmakar. Musician Joi Baruah is slated to perform on Saturday night.

The itinerary of the festival include village tours, exposition of local handicraft and handloom, cultural shows, local folk music and tasting of local cuisines and delicacies.

This Indian calligrapher is on a mission to revive Arabic calligraphy,https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/this-indian-calligrapher-is-on-a-mission-to-revive-arabic-calligraphy/story-q6HLBHIZCwhEYBhXV0QbFI.html,"Sun, 08 Apr 2018 08:21:30 GMT","Arabic calligraphy is worship for Muqtar Ahmed, an Indian calligrapher who has made a mark for himself at a global level. Hailing from a remote village in Telangana, and currently based in Bengaluru, Muqtar is on a mission to revive this dying art in India.

As beautiful as pearls, his works attract attention even if one is not familiar with Arabic. According to him, the aesthetics and refinement are the specialities of Islamic art. “Writing the Quranic verses and Hadith (sayings of the Prophet Mohammad) is worship. These works are sawab-e-jaria (continuous reward),” says the calligrapher, who believes that there is no script as beautiful in the world.

Muqtar believes his efforts have started yielding results as his disciples are carving a niche for themselves at a global level. The only Indian to obtain an “Ijazah” (Master’s diploma) from the Istanbul-based Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture (IRCICA) of the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Muqtar is grooming young talent at the Institute of Indo-Islamic Art and Culture (IIIAC) in Bengaluru.

He has so far trained 500 youngsters, including students and professionals coming from varied backgrounds at the institute. A Japanese girl is among the three foreigners who learnt Arabic calligraphy under him. Muqtar, whose calligraphic works adorn mosques and even private jets abroad, is happy that the institute is getting global recognition for the high standards set by it in Arabic calligraphy.

Three of his students bagged top prizes at a national-level calligraphy competition organised in New Delhi last year by Yayasan Restu, a Malaysian organisation. Ameerul Islam and Abdul Sattar of Hyderabad won the top honours and were selected for an 18-month training programme in Malaysia.

About 400 people from calligraphy institutes across the country participated in the competition. “For the first time, people in India saw what real Arabic calligraphy is,” said Muqtar, who has participated in many exhibitions in different parts of the world.

According to him, the art in India has been in continuous decline after the end of Mughal rule. He pointed out that the calligraphy work in India was never recognised globally, as it was nowhere near the international standard.

Ameerul Islam and Abdul Sattar are now teaching calligraphy at the institute’s Hyderabad branch, which was opened recently. The talented youth, who have participated in competitions in various countries, are training more than 20 students.

Muqtar, who plans to open another branch of the institute in Lucknow, believes that with more youngsters evincing interest in Arabic calligraphy, the art has bright future in the country. The “ijazah” obtained by Muqtar in 2013 may have fetched him a good job in the Arab world, where Islamic art is greatly valued. But he stayed back to revive the art in India, where it once enjoyed royal patronage.

One of his works was purchased by the then governor of Madina in 2011 when he participated in the international exhibition in the holy city in Saudi Arabia.

Interested in calligraphy from his school days, Muqtar migrated from his village in Medak district to Hyderabad to learn the art. He them moved to Bengaluru where he started working for a Urdu daily. Rendered jobless after the newspaper replaced calligraphy with computers in the early 1990s, Muqtar started writing wedding cards to make a living. “It was not my goal. I wanted to go deep into the art,” recalled the artist, who improved his art under renowned international calligraphers Mamoun Luthfi Sakkal and Mohammed Zakariya of the US, and refined it further under the guidance of Turkey’s Hassan Chalabi and Dawood Biktash.

Muqtar, who uses special, handmade pens for his writings, said he achieved precision with perseverance. “Even a small piece of calligraphy takes several hours. You have to write a letter hundreds of times to achieve accuracy,” he said.

Meet the women who are taking classical dance to public spaces,https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/meet-the-women-who-are-taking-classic-dance-to-public-spaces/story-WwX6la4aTrs05CdaBjDkIP.html,"Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:14:10 GMT","Three women in their early 20s, armed with a camera and ghungroos, are taking Bharatnatyam to the streets, staging what are essentially classical dance flash mobs. The dancers are usually dressed in T-shirts and track pants, and each performance is recorded for their YouTube channel, Bharatnatyam in the Wild.

They’re trying to demystify the dance form, address issues about women’s safety and the uncomfortable public gaze, and become more confident about their talent, say twins Aishwarya and Priyanka Kali and classmate Swathi Gangadharan, all 22.

Their first impromptu gig was in August 2016, at Delhi’s Lady Shri Ram College. They were recording a dance video to help Kali’s cousin, who had a Bharatnatyam exam coming up.

“We were doing basic steps like the adavus,” says Aishwarya. “We were taken aback by how aesthetic the video looked, even with no costumes or music.”

Intrigued, they began doing impromptu performances in crowded marketplaces, on pavements, even once at Hawa Mahal in Jaipur. They uploaded short clips on Instagram and Facebook.

The stares they got weren’t always friendly, and the responses online ranged from encouragement to rage. The women realised that not everyone appreciated seeing the ancient and highly stylised dance form played with like this. Which gave them the idea to take it further.

“Bharatnatyam was once performed in temples. Then it moved to auditoriums. It has always catered to a niche group, so we thought, why not take it directly to the masses,” says Swathi, who has been learning the dance form since she was four.

“The message we want to send out is that the public gaze cannot shame, police or embarrass us. There is a feminist element too. As with the Why Loiter campaign [a movement that encourages women to occupy public spaces in Indian cities], it’s our way of claiming our space.”

And so the women dance at traffic intersections, bus stops, heritage monuments, even on a boat in the middle of a lake.

“After we performed at Sarojini Market, we interviewed the hawkers and were surprised to find that most of them could not even identify the dance form,” says Aishwarya. “Some bystanders tell us we’re brave. Others stare awkwardly. Some scold us for ‘trying to get famous’.”

Convincing people that they mean no disrespect has been hard, and it’s a battle that began at home for Swathi. Her mother, who has studied classical Indian dance all her life, was aghast at what she saw as a disrespectful attitude to the form.

“I stood my ground,” Swathi says. “Then on a trip to Aurangabad, I convinced her to do a few steps with me in front of the caves and, to my surprise, she agreed. It’s the clip closest to my heart.”

Back home in Kolkata, Sushmita Kali, 46, mother of the twins, feels the project has made her daughters bolder and more confident. “When they try and explain concepts of feminism to me, I don’t always agree and maybe that’s the generation gap,” she says. “But I know they are on the right track when they ask me thought-provoking questions about gender equality. If this is their small attempt to bring a change, I am all for it working out.”

Meanwhile, the young women are having fun contemporising. Sometimes, they perform a traditional Bharatnatyam piece on the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh in front of a mosque; other times they rope in friends and add elements of Kathak and Mohiniattam as they dance in a garden.

“The nervousness will always be there. I still get a little shy and need to warm up to the spot before I start,” says Swathi. “But we are a lot bolder and more confident as women. It feels like we are reclaiming our spaces, one dance at a time.”","Three women in their early 20s, armed with a camera and ghungroos, are taking Bharatnatyam to the streets, staging what are essentially classical dance flash mobs.

Turkey’s Istanbul Modern art museum to relocate to historic mansion,https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/turkey-s-istanbul-modern-art-museum-to-relocate-to-historic-mansion/story-qIo6wqKjvFH3PNUr1EclRI.html,"Sun, 08 Apr 2018 06:40:18 GMT","It’s a busy afternoon at Istanbul Modern, Turkey’s premier modern art museum, and the gallery is packed with visitors taking selfies or discussing the artworks in hushed tones. Some pause in front of a massive canvas by celebrated German artist Anselm Kiefer, while others look in amazement at a masterpiece by Turkish abstract painter Fahrelnissa Zeid, or gasp at iconic black and white images of old Istanbul by legendary local photographer Ara Guler.

Since opening on December 11, 2004, Istanbul Modern, spectacularly situated on the Bosphorus with a view of the Ottoman-era Topkapi Palace, has become a symbol of 21st century Istanbul, open to outside influences but proud of its past. The rapid success of the museum was one of the reasons Newsweek magazine famously declared in a 2005 cover story that Istanbul was “one of the coolest cities” in the world.

But within a few days of the visit, all the artworks will have been taken down, carefully catalogued and put into protective cases. The building, a maritime warehouse known as Antrepo No. 4 in Turkish and beloved by many Istanbulites since the museum’s opening, will be demolished. However it will not be the end for Istanbul Modern.

Nourish our souls

After closing its doors on March 18, the museum will reopen in a historic mansion in the central Beyoglu district in May. The mansion will be a temporary home until a new museum is built on the site of the old Istanbul Modern to showcase its collection to even greater effect.

The new building will be designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano, who was behind London’s iconic skyscraper The Shard, and is expected to be finished in three years. Istanbul Modern’s director Levent Calikoglu admitted there was some sense of huzun — the Turkish word for melancholy — over leaving the building that had been the museum’s home for the last 14 years.

“Yes, in fact, we have a kind of melancholy and a nostalgia,” he said, inside the museum, which was devoid of visitors as staff carefully took down and packaged the art. “But a new future is in front of us and we have a completely different aim. This new building will bring a new vision to the art world and to Istanbul.”

The opening of Istanbul Modern was supported at the time by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then prime minister, who gave his approval for the use and refurbishment of the maritime warehouse. For some, the museum’s sheer existence was proof that the arts could prosper in Turkey under Erdogan’s Islamic-rooted ruling party, which came to power in 2002.

Artistic expression in Turkey has had some difficult periods since, but Istanbul Modern is proud not just that it has attracted seven million visitors since opening but that they have come from right across the country’s hugely diverse society. And on one of the museum’s final opening days before its temporary closure it was filled with Turks of all ages and backgrounds, as well as a sprinkling of tourists.

“There are things here that I am seeing for the first time, it’s interesting and I appreciate this,” said Gokberk, a 19-year-old who had come with his friends. Visitor Nesrin Aktar, a fan of the museum, hoped the revamp would go smoothly. “We come to see the exhibitions, to nourish our souls, that really inspires us.”

500-year timescale

The main financial backers for the new project are the museum’s founding sponsor Eczacibasi Group, a major backer of the arts in Turkey, and the Dogus Group-Bilgili Holding conglomerate. As with many art projects in Turkey, there is no state funding.

The new museum will be located in a specially dedicated area within the new $1-billion (815-million-euro) Galataport project, which aims to revitalise Istanbul’s historic harbour-side with new living and office spaces beside an overhauled cruise terminal. But it has not met with universal enthusiasm.

The Istanbul Chamber of Architects has denounced the Galataport project as being in violation of planning rules — a claim rejected by its developers — and risking “causing damage that will not be able to be reversed”. In an interview with the Hurriyet daily, Oya Eczacibasi, the chairwoman of the museum’s board, rejected concerns that the new museum would lose its identity within Galataport.

She said Galataport will “add a lot to Istanbul” when completed, insisting Istanbul Modern’s leadership will remain in full control of the museum’s programme. Calikoglu said the Renzo Piano building — whose design is set to be unveiled later in 2018 — should become a new symbol for Istanbul. “For this building he is looking on a timescale of 500 years, he is not looking at a timescale of 20 years,” Calikoglu said.

India’s drag queens on their feminine identities and challenges,https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/india-s-drag-queens-on-their-feminine-identities-and-challenges/story-O3UKpb3ODCi6ZPDuMxlwvI.html,"Sun, 08 Apr 2018 02:44:31 GMT","On any given day, Noida-based 24-year-old Prateek comes across as a soft-spoken, shy and introverted individual, hesitant to engage with others. In a little over three hours of layering make-up, he turns into an entirely new person, wearing clothes that ‘normally’ women would wear. He is almost loud, vivacious, glittering, looking like a showgirl from Las Vegas. This transformation from the boy-next-door to a drag queen named Betta Naan Stop is pretty much the story that several drag artistes go through every time they change their avatars.

Many people might assume that this is merely an act of cross-dressing or men wearing ‘women’s’ clothes but it’s much more than that. It allows men to invoke their expression of femininity through what is now an established art form across the globe. Even though it is self-gratifying for these men – who are all gay – it is an extremely challenging art form for reasons beyond sexuality.

A drag artiste lives a life of contrasts similar to day and night, seamlessly being two different characters, both emerging out of one.

BEYOND CROSS DRESSING

This is how it happens. Prateek creates another person and that person is part of himself but not Prateek as he’s known to be. This other person – the drag persona – is what is built and placed in the limelight. Unlike the pattern that is common to actors in theatre and cinema where an artiste gets known for the many roles that she or he plays, the drag queen is known by her constantly evolving character, which is at a higher decibel level than the person behind the make-up.

In this picture , taken by drag artists Lush, Kush and Betta, they can be seen changing into their costumes in the washroom of Tis Hazari metro station, Delhi.

Take, for instance, 29-year-old Alex Mathew, dark and handsome with a beaming smile, who turns into Maya, a name that comes from the word Mayamma, “mother of illusion”, he explains. This avatar turns the “he” into “she” and the “she” is an “epitome of elegance, sassy and outspoken,” characteristics that Alex hardly depicts while working as a public relations manager at a hotel in Bengaluru. Maya, in fact, still has a “rawness in personality” that people tend to lose “when they try to gel with the norms of society”. She is an alter ego and the lines drawn between the two personas are so clear that “Alex is from Kochi and Maya from a village near Kuttanad in Kerala.”

It is, as Alex says, gender fluidity. “I don’t want to be he or she in the way genders have been defined or need the validation of being a male,” he says. This approach to life, though rewarding and courageous, has left him losing many jobs on his way to becoming Maya.

Ikshaku, 26 years old, has a different story of being a practising environmental lawyer by profession and a drag queen by passion called Kush or Kushboo. As a lawyer and socially too, he is gentle and quiet, pursuing conversations that stimulate his mind, hooked to the world of literature and music. But when he is Kush he is “fierce, liberated, fashionable, risque, avant garde, a singer, actress and ruler.”

Hailing from Assam and now based in Delhi, Ikshaku “started off by simply donning the bedsheets and old clothes” of his mother and later lip-synched to songs. With a little practice, he did make-up and styled his hair – all this as he obtained the dual degrees of a BA and LLB.

His friend Ayushman aka Lush, has a similar story of being a lawyer and an active drag queen. “For most of my childhood in Ranchi, I had censored my life in a manner that I could never embrace myself for who I was,” he says. It was in Delhi that things changed, though not without hurdles. He trained in theatre but got rejected time and again for not being “manly or masculine” enough to get a role. He was more than open to taking on a woman’s role but no one was ready for that. That’s when the definitive image of drag came to him – a character who has “a sense of luxury, exuberance, opulence, and sensory pleasure” – and is “an extension” of himself.

THE ORIGIN

Drag as a term was reportedly first used in 1870 with some claiming that it was an acronym of ‘Dressed Resembling A Girl’. But this claim remains disputed as there is no concrete evidence that acronyms were ever in use in the 19th century. Yet, the word stuck and has now found its way into the Indian queer space of entertainment with an underlying message of non-conformity, trampling over the definitions of being a man, woman or the other. “Through drag I get to show that the pronouns ‘he’, ‘she’ or ‘other’ are often irrelevant,” points out Kush.

Just about every Indian drag artiste has a strong Western influence by way of RuPaul or an Alaska Thunder F**k, both hugely popular American drag performers. Any Indian influence is limited to language, music and names, but not from cross-dressers in the traditional theatre forms that are still alive in many parts of the country. “The context is different. The Indian example is a form of patriarchy that denied women the stage,” says the former Mr Gay India and drag artiste, Sushant Digwikar aka Rani Ko-He-Nur. Possibly this is why the celebrated actor from West Bengal, Janardan Nandi (whose surname is replaced with the word Rani), known for playing the role of a woman for almost all of his 75 years in theatre, uses the word ‘impersonation’ rather than drag.

Not every drag queen picked this art form as some kind of choice or realisation of the self. Sushant’s connection with drag was incidental as he cross-dressed as a co-host for the Kashish Film Festival in 2015. One thing led to another and he was soon given the drag name Rani Ko-He-Nur by Keshav Suri, who is credited with the rise of drag performances in India, given the way he has promoted them at his night clubs in Delhi and Bangalore, Kitty Su and Kitty Ko. This has suddenly led to a variety of events – such as the Red Festival, Queer- E- Mehfil and the Bangalore Queer Film Festival – throwing in a drag show or two.

Whether there is an ‘industry’ in the making is unknown but artistes such as Prateek have made drag their priority and want it to be accepted as a “respectable art form”. He already has a self-funded YouTube channel in place. Sushant aims to take drag to the national stage probably using media such as TV as a tool. Alex believes that there can be one drag queen for each state of India.

But it all comes down to finances and sustenance. According to Suri, he would never have imagined that when the first international drag queen – Violet Chachki – performed at Kitty Su, there would be 1,800 people in the audience. It is no surprise then that an Indian act draws a crowd of around 500-1,000 people. “Indians are not as close-minded as we like to pretend and portray,” he points out, suggesting that his message of ‘pure-love’ is one that will create a bigger space for drag artistes.

The queens, however, are not sitting pretty. They call themselves sisters, unified by their distinct characters, large-size eyelashes, self-stitched outfits with sequins and anything that shines. Many perform for free so as to garner a larger audience, making more people aware of what they do. They are happy to open their art to those who wish to come out of themselves and to get into this space. Unlike the world around them, “drag does not have rules or a specific criteria. If you want to do drag, you do drag!” says Prateek.","This transformation from the boy-next-door to a drag queen named Betta Naan Stop is pretty much the story that several drag artistes go through every time they change their avatars.
It allows men to invoke their expression of femininity through what is now an established art form across the globe.

"Bonsai guitar: Here’s how this orchestra is popularising the ukulele, with punk rock numbers",https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/bonsai-guitar-here-s-how-this-orchestra-is-popularising-the-ukulele-with-punk-rock-numbers/story-e2y5Gm0HMuraGBibCLrnZM.html,"Sat, 07 Apr 2018 08:24:43 GMT","The ukulele has two obvious selling points: it is affordable and easy to carry. But could the unassuming four-string instrument also incarnate the spirit of punk rock? Since forming three decades ago, the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain has helped build a new audience for what it calls the “bonsai guitar,” playing musically faithful but thoroughly tongue-in-cheek renditions of popular tunes.

Starting its latest US tour, the orchestra -- clad in evening finest, including tuxedo jackets and bow ties -- quickly pulled in dozens of smartphone-snapping onlookers as the eight ukuleleists strummed their way through AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell.” Playing with the Australian headbangers’ poetry, soloist Ben Rouse sang, “Hey Satan / Paying my dues / Playing in a ukulele band,” as the players raised their instruments to the heavens in mock defiance.

Asked why he took up the ukulele, fellow player Jonty Bankes said, “Basically, it’s cheap and rather easy to play, so for people like us it was a godsend.” But the self-styled orchestra has noticed a power in the tiny instrument over the years -- with gigs including two nights at Carnegie Hall, a set at the Glastonbury Festival in England and a private party at Windsor Castle for Queen Elizabeth II’s 90th birthday.

“The thing is, when you bring a ukulele out and start playing it, it does actually make people smile,” Bankes said. “It’s an unthreatening, friendly instrument which causes a bit of happiness worldwide, really,” he said.

- Started as a joke -

Co-founded by Kitty Lux -- whose death last year at 59 brought a rare serious note to the ensemble with a memorial concert -- the group initially was interested not in the ukulele itself but in the irreverent energy of punk rock, then on its wane.

Musicians Dave Suich and Peter Brooke Turner of The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain, (AFP)

“Punks could form a band and play three chords, if indeed they could play three. The way that the band started, the same thing happened” said Leisa Rea, who nonetheless had learned guitar before ukulele.“The instrument was a bit of a joke, I suppose, and we turned everything on its head. The spirit of punk is alive in the band,” she said.

“We don’t take ourselves too seriously. We’re British, so we’ve got to have some sense of humor, really,” she said. Rea fronted the group for its take of the Eurythmics’ “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),” with an amplified bass ukulele holding the rhythm under seven ukuleles of different pitches. “It’s a good way of detecting if a song is any good,” she said. “If you can play it on a ukulele, it’s a pretty good sign that it’s a decent song.”

- From irony to mainstream -

Despite the orchestra’s wide travels, it has never played in Hawaii, the birthplace of the instrument initially modelled after a miniature Portuguese guitar. The group is eager to make it to the island chain, but its failure so far to make it there is not entirely accidental. The orchestra avoids Hawaiian music -- as well as songs of early 20th-century British film star and ukulele enthusiast George Formby -- as it instead tries to surprise audiences.

But the ukulele has become less of an oddity for audiences since the band’s formation in 1985. Native Hawaiian artist Israel Kamakawiwo’ole found an international following in the 1990s with his mellow ukulele songs, while pop artists, notably the indie rock godfather Stephin Merritt, have found ample possibilities with the ukulele.

Orchestra member Dave Suich said he hoped the group has helped increase the popularity of the ukulele, especially in schools, where the little four-stringer has been giving stiff competition to the recorder as a first instrument for children.

“People younger than 40 don’t know that it’s funny,” Suich said. “They just think you play an instrument.”

Delhi weekend: Exhibition on Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay,https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/delhi-weekend-exhibition-on-kamaladevi-chattopadhyay/story-OJf7tpNzSKRqy9KZqKfRRP.html,"Sat, 07 Apr 2018 03:44:43 GMT","The name of Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay should be a fixture in Indian textbooks -- she was a freedom fighter, a social reformer, a feminist icon and a pioneering force in the revival of India’s handicrafts. Instead, on April 3, when Google created a special doodle to mark her 115th birth anniversary, her name was unfamiliar to most Indians, a testament to how often history forgets to celebrate remarkable women.

It is not easy to contain Kamaladevi’s life and legacy on a few mounted placards, but a new exhibition at the India International Centre attempts to introduce people to her vast contributions. It is befitting that both the venue and the organisers speak of Kamaladevi’s legacy -- the exhibition has been put together by the Delhi Craft Council, which was founded by her in 1967 and is showing at IIC’s Kamaladevi complex, named after her in honour of her services as the organisation’s first vice-president.

Kamaladevi was born on April 3, 1903 in an influential Saraswat Brahmin family from Mangalore. The youngest of four sisters, she was a keen student, learning dance and Sanskrit drama traditions. Prominent freedom fighters and thinkers such as Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Ramabai Ranade, Annie Besant were early influences in the young Kamaladevi’s life, but she drew her inspiration equally from her mother and grandmother, both educated, resilient women who brought her up.

In Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay and the Making of Modern India, a collection of essays on her many achievements, academic Radha Kumar recalls how she tried to convince Kamaladevi to let her write about her life, arguing that “her memories would repair a crucial gap in our knowledge of the history of the pre-Independence Indian women’s movement and, most crucially, of the immediate post-Independence period.”

Kamaladevi refused, but Kumar made a compelling case.

Remarkable is a word that applies easily to Kamaladevi’s life. Married at 14, widowed at 16. At 20, she married for a second time, to poet-playwright and Sarojini Naidu’s brother Harindranath Chattopadhyay, with whom she produced and acted in several plays, making her stage debut. If that was risqué, Kamaladevi defied tradition further by acting in silent films in the early 1930s, an act still considered taboo for women from upper-class, upper-caste households.

Hers was a life of many firsts, since she never shied away from exercising her agency in the face of constraints. She travelled to London with her husband and obtained a diploma in Sociology from Bedford College. Inspired by the suffragette Margaret E Cousins, she founded the All India Women’s Conference and became the first Indian woman to run for a legislative seat.

At the height of the Indian freedom movement, Kamaladevi was swayed by Mahatma Gandhi’s ideas and joined the Congress in 1927. Two years later, she was elected as the head of the Youth Congress. When Gandhi launched the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930, Kamaladevi persuaded him to allow women to participate actively. She was arrested for her part in the Salt Satyagraha at Bombay and sent to Yerwada jail.

She emerges as a woman fiercely committed to her convictions. Though she remained a proponent of Gandhi’s ideas, she was vocal in her disagreement with him on several issues, such as the participation of women in Dandi march and, crucially, on the Partition, which finally lead her to severe her association with politics. Post-independence, Kamaladevi eschewed any political positions, choosing to work for the rehabilitation of refugees and helping set up a Refugee Handicrafts Centre.

Kamaladevi’s vast, rich legacy has been the revival and championing of Indian handloom and handicrafts. In 1952, the government set up the All Indian Handicrafts Board, appointing her its chairperson. As its head, Kamaladevi invested in research, training and marketing and the result of her efforts could be seen in the revival of many a craft tradition, from the Chamba Rumals of Himachal Pradesh to the Ikats of Pochampalli.

How she lived, her political career, her literary and cultural oeuvre, her single-minded devotion to the handicraft industry, in all ways Kamaladevi’s life exemplified how the personal is the political. This weekend, head to this quiet exhibition to acquaint yourself with this extraordinary life.

"Child labour photos from 100 years ago that shocked America, in a new avatar",https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/child-labour-photos-from-100-years-ago-that-shocked-america-in-a-new-avatar/story-yogIJ1XXYegMgPeLH6EAcJ.html,"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 03:41:09 GMT","If you love poring over old pictures, chances are you may have come across a black-and-white image of 11-year-old Roland, a newsboy working tirelessly in heavy rainstorm in the America of the 1920s. Or, perhaps that of 8-year-old Jennie Camillo, picking cranberries, her dress muddied and skin tanned. Even Preston, all of just 5, labouring with cartons to make some quick bucks.

Set in the early 20th century, that was a time when, fuelled by Industrial Revolution, children were employed — or exploited — at a very young age as they were easier to manage and could be paid much less than adults. Shot by the famous Lewis Wickes Hine, the images were originally in black-and-white, limited by the technology then.

However, the same photographs are now available in colour, thanks to UK-based professional photo colouriser, Tom Marshall (29), who has breathed life into the long-forgotten snaps taken between 1909 and 1925.

Colourisation is a process by which colour is added to black-and-white images. It could be done as a special effect or to modernise black-and-white photos or films. “I chose to colourise the photos of American child labour due to their historical significance, and the impact that I thought the photos would have in colour,” Tom said.

Explaining the reason for choosing Hine’s photos, he said, “When I choose photos, I always try to look for clear and crisp images that engage the viewer. Lewis Wickes Hine’s photos are perfect for this, especially those where the children look directly into the camera. When colour is applied I think their faces seem more ‘alive’.”

“The issue of child labour itself is still very relevant worldwide, and I consciously chose the subject to get people talking about it. When my images are published I’m always fascinated by the online comment threads and the debates that they can spark,” says Tom, who’s colourising company is called PhotograFix and deals with some of the world’s leading museums, photo archives and publishers,” he added.

But how did the original photographer, Hine, manage to get these images clicked—there must have been some risk involved for sure? And how did he get access to such places where child labour was rampant?

“Hine took considerable risks to take the photos. He was employed by the National Child Labor Committee (NCLC), whose mission was to promote the rights, awareness, dignity, well-being and education of children and youth as they relate to work and working. To be able to document the children at work, he couldn’t simply ask for permission and so would resort to wearing disguises such as a fire inspector or industrial photographer (making a record of factory machinery) in order to gain access to the workshops. He was threatened with violence and death from factory foremen. So it was a risky business,” explained Tom.

However, how is it that such a practice was allowed to run in America for such a long time, and to what extent?

“Child labour wasn’t exactly a secret in America at the time, but it wasn’t something discussed in ‘polite society’. The 1900 US Census listed that 1,752,187 children between the ages of five and ten were employed in ‘gainful occupations’. This was a 50% increase from the 1880 figure, and the NCLC made a point of showcasing this worrying trend. Hine’s photos brought the issue to the attention of the wider public.

“Hine wasn’t alone in taking these photos—there were other documentary photographers—but Hine was a pioneer in the way that he used his medium as a tool for social reform. His training in sociology allowed him to use the camera as a means of tugging at America’s heartstrings,” said Tom.

Go for summer-friendly fabrics like muslin, khadi",https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/it-s-time-to-update-your-wardrobe-go-for-summer-friendly-fabrics-like-muslin-khadi/story-9dy1Z9qJn3UJwdZjdERuTP.html,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 01:26:47 GMT","Treat your skin to soothing fabrics and beat the punishing heat in jumpsuits stitched from khadi, tops made in poplin or kurtis in linen cotton, suggest experts. Anupam Arya, Director at Fabriclore, and Rishabh Khanna, Director at Fabricasa, have listed fabrics for this season:

* Muslin hand blocks: This loosely plain-woven cotton-viscose fabric is a summer-friendly option for designing casual ensembles. A colour palette of yellow, coral, olive green decked with hand block designs inspired by the Mughal gardens and architecture, or conventional designs of paisleys, bootas and more are a stand-out option for the season.

* Textured south cotton is a perfect fabric to beat the heat and yet keep your fashion game on point.

* Designs of plain textures, zari borders, patchworks, tie and dye and checks are an ideal match for crafting casual and semi-formal outfits like kurtas, asymmetrical dresses, jumpsuits, saris, blouses and men’s shirts and jackets.

* Gold foil and embroidered Chanderi silk: With a sheer texture, feather-like fall and breezy feel, Chanderi silk in a pastel colour palette is a no-brainer for summers. With the base in shades of blush, cadmium orange, rose madder, sap green and warm grey, you can choose from the subtle threadwork of paisleys or florals or gold foil printing in designs of bells, jhumkas, sun chariots, bootis, and more.

* Khadi: Being a go-to summery fashion-loyal fabric, khadi has been catching a lot of eyeballs in the fashion world. Dhoti or straight pants, jumpsuits, kurtas, crop tops, capes, short jackets and more done in soft pastel shades of brown, off-white, pink, beige are bang-on to make a summer style statement.

* Quirky poplin: Keeping in line with the summer mood, if you have a thing for quirky fabrics, poplin would make for an ideal choice. Fruity, birdy or playful object designs done in soft pastel tones on a smooth, shiny and sturdy fabric like poplin should be a summer constant in your wardrobe. Design a plethora of dresses, play around with the sleeves, necklines and accentuate them with quirky tassels or pom-poms.

* Plain modal silk: As soon as the summer heat knocks our door, a lot of us like to switch to basics. Modal silk in hues of pink, pista green and cool grey can be designed into straight suits, shararas, gararas, palzzos and skirts. A very luxurious fabric, you can match it with your prints or team it with a chanderi silk or tissue silk dupatta to complete the look.

* Digital print satin: Glossy floral and abstract patterns digitally printed on slick and lustrous satin, dipped in pastel shades of teal, salmon, lemon yellow, pansy violet can easily be fashioned into modern-chic outfits like gowns, concept saris, straight maxi dresses, skirts, crop tops and jumpsuits.

* Linen cotton: A nice peach pink coloured soft fabric with bamboo joint texture which is one of the most soothing and comfortable summer fabrics with sweat absorbing properties. The fabric allows easy air flow and reflects heat better.

* Cotton print: With the onset of summers, cotton makes the best wear as is it makes you feel comfortable even in the extremely humid time. It is lightweight and easily absorbs sweat from the body and helps your skin breathe making you feel cool.

But her latest is absolutely unforgettable.

In an Instagram post she shared on Monday, the style-setting actor put a picture wearing a high-slit skirt from French label Jacquemus’ spring/summer 2018 collection. Shilpa put a good portion of her body on display, wearing a strappy Massimo Dutti top and a ruffled asymmetric skirt from Jacquemus that exposed her thigh on one side, while appearing somewhat modest on the other. It is priced at €590 (Rs47,395).

The skirt, featuring a flounced trim for playful volume, drapes around the waist in the style of a summery sarong. It is sexy for sure, but the uplifting shade of yellow and a laid-back white top balanced that vibe. She accessorised with dainty Swarovski jewellery and a pair of white Kurt Geiger pumps.

If you’re on a mission to upgrade your wardrobe this season, try picking up a feminine skirt like Shilpa’s for an effortless piece that can be paired with a casual tee or sheer tucked-in blouse for one very stylish outfit.

Shilpa’s skirt is made to draw attention to your lower half. And if your frame is straight up and down with fewer curves you’ll be happy to have it in your closet. Because you’ll do best in such a skirt — one that has ruffles or asymmetrical details or anything that creates the illusion of curves or a wider bottom. You can mix and match with boots to stay warm or wear sandals for a more laid-back look. If you’re feeling extra frisky, toss on a cropped leather jacket for a bit of edge.

We love the idea of halter tops in summer — they’re less revealing than most tanks, and great for women who aren’t afraid to show off their shoulders. It can instantly amp up your going-out wardrobe, whether you’re attending a brunch with friends or hitting the dance floor on Saturday night.

Just remember, when reinventing the halter neck — both with tops and dresses — stick to solid colours and minimal cuts and accessorise with some seriously statement jewellery or heels or hairdo, as demonstrated by Malaika.

But that’s not all, Malaika has been showing off an understated (well, barring this halter neck two-piece) yet chic collection of looks during her recent spottings. (Basically, every time she leaves her house).

On Sunday, Malaika wore this cream and gold palazzo set by Ashley Rebello, which she paired with a grey net dupatta from Seema Khan. With the billowy bottoms, the look feels undeniably fresh and breathable, while the contrasting dupatta adds interest to the outfit.

"Never spray perfume directly and 12 ways to clean, store, preserve different saree types",https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/never-spray-perfume-directly-and-12-ways-to-clean-store-preserve-different-saree-types/story-ELpPUJs7ZkgY6JaTIZCVGN.html,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 08:01:50 GMT","Since you’ve invested in some beautiful sarees, it’s time to start treating them with respect. Buying sarees is one thing — but there’s a lot you can do to make them endure. If you need tips on storing and even cleaning your sarees correctly to prolong the life of your favourite items, you have come to the right place.

While everyone loves buying new sarees, sometimes the sarees already in your closet get neglected. But

Weaverstory.com founder Nishant Malhotra and Vineet Chhajer, director, Vineet’s Sarees, are here to save the day with suggestions on how to care for, clean and preserve sarees:

1. For koras, organzas and chanderis: They should be rolled around tall wooden sticks wrapped in mulmul and stored flat beneath a stack of heavy sarees. From time to time, refold them to avoid tears appearing along the creases. Never hang your koras and organzas in hangers for a long time.

2. For tissue sarees: It is always advisable to get your expensive tissue sarees washed from Banarasi karigars. A normal dry cleaning can put crinkles in your tissues, whereas they wash them on long tables.

3. Chiffon sarees: They need more care than most other sarees. Whether or not to roller dry (charak) chiffons/georgettes depends on the individual’s taste. A hard roller-ironing removes the natural crinkle in expensive diamond chiffons. But often ordinary chiffons have no crinkles, so roller-ironing is a must to provide an artificial crinkle.

It is always advisable not to put saree pins with your sarees, especially with chiffons. They shouldn’t be worn tightly as the cloth is very delicate. Don’t hang chiffons and georgettes with heavy embroidery or borders as with time, the weight of the work itself could tear the saree.

4. Cotton saree: This variety can be washed at home or at a laundry depending on how much you have paid for them, how often you wear them and how passionately you feel attached to them. It is advisable to get your fancy cottons or cottons with zari dry cleaned. Colours like turquoise blue, shocking pink and black almost and always bleed and require special precautions when washed at home. Starch often kills a cotton saree’s longevity, but then the beauty of a cotton saree lies in its crisp look.

Some more tips...

5. Wrap them carefully in muslin cloth as it will protect the saree from foul smell and unwanted dust.

6. Don’t use metal hangers so that the sarees don’t get corroded. In case you are not using hangers, stack it up one over another with ony one fold. Too many folds may lead to sticking up the weaves or the cloth, resulting in ruining a saree.

7. Dry cleaning is preferred because detergents could ruin it. If dry cleaning does not come in handy, wash it with a mix of baby shampoo and a spoon of liquid daily detergent.

8. Never dry the saree in direct sunlight unless you want to see the colours fade away.

9. To remove hard stains, you could consider using petrol if you don’t go for dry cleaning. Acetone can be used to remove nail paint stains. To get rid of oil stains, rub talcum powder before washing it with a mild detergent.

10. If you are willing to keep intact you heavy work sarees, always fold them inside out.

11. Using perfumes, deodorants or any form of fragrance directly on the saree may leave an non-removable stain. Hence, it is advised to spray a bit on your wrist.

12. Always keep it in mind to iron your sarees on low to medium heat. High heat may leave a patch.

13. Avoid keeping naphthalene balls around it to avoid moths. Instead, use neem leaves over muslin cloth to keep it fresh and odour free.

Aishwarya Rai’s hot pink lehenga is the perfect way to bring quiet drama to your wedding,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/aishwarya-rai-s-hot-pink-lehenga-is-the-perfect-way-to-bring-quiet-drama-to-your-wedding/story-1CvrOd3yVS06ceYDYOVsQJ.html,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 03:42:44 GMT","Whether you’re a bride or her best friend looking for outfit ideas for a wedding, look no further than actor Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s latest lehenga. Whether your wedding/ mehendi/sangeet is set in a casual garden or beachside, this knockout pink embellished lehenga from House of Masaba will — no doubt — speak to you.

Aishwarya’s look melded timeless (high-waist printed lehenga and modest high-neck blouse) with sassy (pink) at an event in Pune on Saturday and we think this style would be perfect for a traditional wedding that welcomes a touch of modern.

Designed by Masaba Gupta, the two-tone ensemble — pink lehenga embellished with tribal vase, leaf foil and kalash motifs in gold foil print and rich gold embroidered kallis paired with a light stone grey and gold printed dupatta in khadi — certainly doesn’t skimp on spotlight-worthy details. Be it its rich colours, exquisite fabrics, and dramatic silhouettes.

Aishwarya’s traditional gold and diamond earrings and bangles lent just enough shine to her polished ensemble. Poker straight hair, dewy make-up, a pink lip, exaggerated winged eye and a small black bindi finished off the look.

A post shared by Mufasa✨🌙 (@masabagupta) on Apr 8, 2018 at 3:53am PDT

For an edgy-meets-glam look that’s perfect for day and night-time nuptials, mimic Aishwarya’s festive pink look. Then to dress things up a tad, add statement earrings and keep your hair tied in a bun for a bold look, suggests Masaba.

The striking pink colour is a surefire way to get you noticed and can work everywhere, even at a black-tie affair. Morever, you probably will be able to wear it again after your wedding. It screams chic bridesmaid and then some. You can buy this lehenga for Rs 63,000.

A post shared by House Of Masaba (@houseofmasaba) on Apr 7, 2018 at 11:40pm PDT

Pink is a such wonderful way to add feminine sophistication to your special day, just like actors Sonakshi Sinha and Dia Mirza, and celebrity interior designer Sussanne Khan, recently showed.

While the hues ranged from soft pink to pinkish chrome to hot pink, the three celebrities, who attended separate weddings, showed that the sweet colour is definitely in trend with their must-see wedding-ready lehengas. Scroll to see who you think pulled off pink the best.

1. Sussanne’s House of Masaba lehenga was simple in silhouette, but a punchy fuchsia style and unexpected traditional accessories gave it that something special. With such a sassy-meets-classic aesthetic, this look can easily work for a garden affair. Don’t forget to add gold accessories and a bright lip for a pop of colour.

A post shared by Sussanne Khan (@suzkr) on Nov 23, 2017 at 9:06pm PST

2. Dia played up the feminine charm with her dusty rose-hued look from Ekaya. We appreciate the addition of traditional gold earrings and necklace, too. Find a classic, clean lehenga like this for a glamorous evening affair,then bring it to life via glam touches like traditional jewellery and an equally pretty clutch.

A post shared by Dia Mirza (@diamirzaofficial) on Nov 23, 2017 at 5:32am PST

3. Sonakshi didn’t fail to impress with her rosy floral applique lehenga either. The soft lace off-the-shoulder choli is a darling. This Monika Nidhii ensemble marriers sex appeal and romance perfectly and with its flowy, ethereal feel it would meld beautifully at a wedding by the water. Add beachy, wavy hair like the star’s to match.

Which tiara will Meghan Markle wear at her wedding? The history of the accessory offers clues,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/which-tiara-will-meghan-markle-wear-at-her-wedding-the-history-of-the-accessory-offers-clues/story-TRh8qNFSOCtfAdu9NYab9K.html,"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 03:35:29 GMT","For decades, the tiara was, at best, a retro piece of costume jewellery. Yet this classic accessory has been showing up on fashion runways from the likes of Saint Laurent and Miu Miu, as well as binge-worthy television shows such as Game of Thrones and Victoria, not to mention The Crown. Even Wonder Woman wears a uniform that features a weaponised tiara.

British jeweller Garrard & Co. has noticed a resurgence as well. Long synonymous with royalty, the warrant-holder has been the official crown jeweller for almost 200 years, and it is the company that Prince Charles tasked with making the engagement ring for the late Diana, Princess of Wales. According to Claire Scott, Garrard’s soft-spoken head of design, the company has had a surge in private commissions for tiaras this year. People are also waiting to see which tiara Meghan Markle opts to wear for her wedding.

“When I first started in the trade, there were tiaras being made — definitely some, but not as many as we see now,” says Scott. She’s sitting on a sofa in the tony, all-beige store off London’s Bond Street; the atelier is upstairs. She estimates her team will work on 20 custom tiaras this year, which, in this rarefied air, counts as a huge uptick. Under Scott’s direction, Garrard has introduced a large collection of ready-to-wear tiaras, too.

Part of the reason, Scott says, is that tiaras are unfailingly flattering. These mini-crowns tend to lengthen necks and straighten backs — the sheer weight of one will make even the slouchiest stand taller. “It gives you a different feeling, a different posture,” she says. “That’s something people like. It surprises them.”

Nothing has spurred the tiara revival more than the princess effect. (Instagram)

An additional benefit is that, in selfie culture, any jewellery worn on or around the face is appealing: who needs to filter a snap when you’re wearing a tiara? They are also unabashedly status-making jewellery pieces. Historically, sporting a tiara was a tacit wealth-signaler, and the association with wealth and power has persisted.

What distinguishes the tiara from a mere headdress is one thing: the framework, which encircles the head and is hidden with ribbons and upswept hair. It’s purely functional, allowing tiaras that could be cumbersome to sit more comfortably on the head. Traditionally, Scott says, tiaras were convertible. Maids could painstakingly unhook the gems from the framework, so the same piece could be worn as a necklace. Some of Garrard’s recent commissions offer this function.

...In selfie culture, any jewellery worn on or around the face is appealing: who needs to filter a snap when you’re wearing a tiara? They are also unabashedly status-making jewellery pieces.

If you’re buying a tiara, use this approximation to gauge perfect placement: With thumb and forefinger, measure the distance from the bridge of your nose — between the eyebrows — and your chin. Measure that distance from the bridge of your nose to the top of your head. Wherever it lands is where a tiara should sit. Etiquette has also been part of the tiara’s aura. Royal ladies don’t wear tiaras until they’re married, for instance.

“Your first wearing of a tiara would be on your wedding day,” Scott says. Among nobility, tiaras were usually heirlooms, pieces of family jewellery, so the family tiara would be passed down to a bride as part of her trousseau. In turn, that tiara was expected to be deeded to a daughter or daughter-in-law for use on her own wedding day —after a fit adjustment by the jeweller who had made it.

Today, though, these mini-crowns are tailor-made for the young and glamorous. And nothing has spurred the tiara revival more than the princess effect — via Frozen’s Elsa, Kate Middleton, or the upcoming nuptials for Meghan Markle. After Princess Diana’s death in 1997, there was a decade-long dearth of British royals able to wear tiaras, whether by age or inclination. But that has changed in the past five years: Soon, two married princesses will be able to rifle the royal dressing-up box.

When Kate Middleton married William, the prospective king, there was no family tiara for her to wear; instead, the Queen passed along a Cartier-designed mini-crown she had received for her 18th birthday. The big question now is which tiara Meghan Markle will wear on May 19. Perhaps it will be the Garrard-produced Lover’s Knot tiara, a favourite of Princess Diana — the guest Prince Harry is most likely to miss at his wedding party.

Summer skin care: Try these 5 Ayurvedic remedies to protect your skin from the sun,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/summer-skin-care-try-these-5-ayurvedic-remedies-to-protect-your-skin-from-the-sun/story-60cPRLUm41OCCLxTkNdZzH.html,"Mon, 09 Apr 2018 02:28:06 GMT","Summer can be fun despite the sweltering heat if one knows how to take good care of the skin and hair. Protect your skin from the harmful UV rays by putting together some simple natural ingredients that are available in every household.

Here are some Ayurvedic tips for tackling skin issues in summer.

* Skin hydration is the key: Ayurveda mentions that ‘Snigdhata’ (meaning internal hydration) of the body is the key to fight multiple skin-related issues. One should schedule water drinking reminders across the day. Carry a water bottle to avoid thirsty outings and travels. Replace aerated drinks, tea and coffee with coconut water, thandai, kokum sharbat, lemon juice, buttermilk, khas drink, sugarcane juice, etc.

*Mind the heat: According to Ayurveda, the basic reason behind blood impurification and skin disorders is sudden temperature changes. Avoid stepping out directly from AC rooms into the sun and vice-versa.

*Try Ayurvedic DIY (Do it Yourself) face mask: Use multani mitti face mask in combination with milk for dry skin, honey for oily skin and water for normal skin. This will improve the natural glow of the skin. One can also try a homemade face pack with smash boiled potatoes and 2 tbsp of lemon juice to bleach the skin.

*Spice up your life: Cinnamon has great anti-microbial properties. Powder it and mix with 1 tablespoon of honey and sugar granules. Use this mixture as a natural scrub to remove the dead skin from the face.

*Coat skin with layers of aloe vera and cucumber: Skin toners are very important for people with oily or acne-prone skin as they cleanse the skin and close the pores by tightening the cell gaps. Preparing a toner depending on your skin type will have a great effect. Mix apple cider, vinegar and water in 1:1 ratio and add half cup of green tea, cucumber juice and aloe vera gel. Shake it well and then apply it on the skin to soothe and repair it.

As for the latter two, we’ve got you covered in the what-to-wear department.

The most important things to remember? It’s all about keeping your outfit light and your accessories even lighter. To inspire your pool-party panache is actor Kareena Kapoor Khan, who made a bold, breezy statement with a light, albeit bright, House of Masaba ensemble.

A post shared by NISHSAYS (@nishsays) on Apr 8, 2018 at 12:39pm PDT

On Friday, the 3 Idiots star covered up her ochre-hued oversized slip dress with a half-sleeved bench-bed print cape jacket, while soaking up the son with son Taimur Ali Khan at friend Amrita Arora’s Mumbai residence.

To keep the free-spirited vibe consistent, she paired the silk ensemble, featuring royal blue motifs, with equally offbeat accents, like round tinted sunglasses and beaded slip-ons.

A post shared by Shivani Datwani (@shivdatwani) on Apr 7, 2018 at 11:07pm PDT

Get inspired by Kareena’s leggy sun-kissed look and try the free-spirited way to strut out to the pool: Add some luxe vibes to your one-piece by throwing on a matching kimono and belting it at the waist. You can buy Kareena’s ensemble for Rs 9,999.

Ah, the versatile cover-up — a must-have summertime staple: Who says capes or robes or kimon-style cover-ups are just for the beach? Not us — or Kareena or Alia Bhatt, for that matter.

A post shared by House Of Masaba (@houseofmasaba) on Jun 18, 2017 at 11:51pm PDT

When you are not digging your toes in the sand, repurpose your flouncy cover-up for an outing, like Alia did in June 2017. Demonstrating how a cape jacket can easily be dressed up with accessories for dinner-time, the Dear Zindagi actor wore the same resort-friendly Masaba item as Kareena for filmmaker Imtiaz Ali’s birthday celebrations. Totally acceptable.

While it might seem to be an unlikely association, history stands witness to numerous examples of fast-food giants teaming up with their fashion counterparts, combining their respective appealing powers, which have, occasionally, given us the perfect ‘best of both worlds’ products.

Many of the better food-fashion collaborations have ended in sneakers. Come on! Imagine a snicker-sneaker or a doughnut-sneaker! Shoe brands like Nike and Saucony have proved in recent times that designing sneakers based on the latest and hottest food trends can not only be a visual delight, but also a marketing hit. Here’s a rundown of Footwear News’ four greatest partnerships between food chains and sneaker manufacturers within the last year.

1. Saucony and Dunkin’ Donuts

With the Boston Marathon fast approaching, scheduled to be held on April 16, the popular coffee and doughnut house’s has joined forces with Saucony to create a limited edition design that looks like sprinkles falling off a strawberry doughnut. Available for both men and women, expect to see the coffeehouse’s tagline ‘America runs on Dunkin’ becoming a reality.

2. The Shoe Surgeon and Pizza Hut

Pizza Hut took innovative designing to a whole new level with the ‘Pie Tops II’, a sneaker that will take over the pizza ordering for you. In 2017, the company collaborated with Dominic Chambrone, a.k.a. The Shoe Surgeon, to come up with the first-ever basketball shoes that could order a pizza by pressing a button on its tongue. Just 50 pairs went up for sale, available in a red and wheat colour combo. The shoe includes a feature to pause live TV via a button on the other shoe.

3. Nike and Momofuku

Nike’s skateboarding team, last year, collaborated with Momofuku’s star chef, David Chang, who is well known for his affinity for the athletic giant, on the Nike SB Dunk High Pro “Momofuku”. Released in limited quantities last summer, the high top sneaker features a dark grey tone, resembling the colour of the aprons worn by the Momofuku staff, with the restaurant’s signature peach logo.

Want your skin to look youthful? Slow down ageing with these 10 simple habits,https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/want-your-skin-to-look-youthful-slow-down-ageing-with-these-10-simple-habits/story-fFMiGKWsEM9VpRT4HLhITP.html,"Mon, 09 Apr 2018 06:18:51 GMT","Ageing is a natural process that can’t be stopped but you can try slowing down its effects from showing by drinking adequate water and using sunscreen every time you step out, suggest experts. Shubhika Jain, Founder of RAS Luxury Oils, Sham Kumar, Education Manager at Kiehl’s India, and Chiranjiv Chhabra, Director and consultant dermatologist at Skin Alive Clinics, list some tips:

* Chronic dehydration is the number one cause for skin ageing. Drinking water helps to restore elasticity of the skin and moisturises on a cellular level. This in turn gives you a more youthful glow. Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day to keep yourself hydrated and get luminous, healthy skin.

* Cortisol, the stress hormone in your body causes mental and physical fatigue, leading to untimely ageing of skin. To reduce daily stress resort to exercising, meditation, calming massages and aromatherapy. These will instantly charge up your mind, body and spirit.

* Start your everyday skincare regimen with a gentle cleanser suiting your skin type. Look out for ingredients such as calendula or cucumber, which are mild in its approach and have soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. For the next step, apply an effective alcohol-free toner according to your skin type. The toner helps in gently cleansing the facial skin while refreshing it without any harsh synthetic drying agents. A toner also helps tighten the pores and prepares the skin for some serum and moisturiser.

Following the toner is a hydrating serum. Look out for an active and effective serum with ingredients such as pure vitamin C, micro filtered yeast extract or glycerin. A serum is used to intensively hydrate facial skin making it look less dull and tired. It also helps in smoothing the appearance of fine lines and uneven textures.

* Moisturise with a light but effective daily face cream. It aids in replenishing skin hydration by drawing and absorbing moisture from the air, leaving the skin smooth, soft and healthy looking. Look for a moisturising cream with anti-ageing benefits which has ingredients like hyaluronic acid, jasmonic acid, copper PCA, and calcium PCA.

* Collagen helps to strengthen our skin, hair and nails. This valuable protein in the body can be restored with inducing more protein in the diet. Adequate protein intake reduces sagging skin, prevents premature aging and support overall health. Introduce almonds, broccoli, oats, quinoa, walnuts and tofu and soya milk for repairing and constructing tissue and keep your collagen intact.

* Toxins leech vital minerals and cause premature ageing. Antioxidants like vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotene are essential to restore the lost nutrients from the body. Green vegetables support healthy blood glucose levels, manage blood pressure and reverse oxidative stress.

* Use natural oils like lavender, rosehip, geranium, pomegranate and sandalwood. They have potent moisturising properties that will make the skin look radiant, bright and wrinkle-free. From parabens to preservatives, toxic chemicals found in many beauty care products, not only increase our toxic load, but also age our skin at a faster rate.

* Sunscreen is an imperative step in the skin care regimen as UV A and UV B rays are present throughout the year. This can cause serious damage to the skin and can also lead to pre-mature ageing, deep tissue damage and skin cancer. It is recommended to pick SPF 50 when the sun is at its peak during the daytime. Opt for some UV filters in the sunscreen and look for mexoryl SX, mexoryl XL and titanium dioxide.

* It is hard to quit, but giving up your smoking habit is one of the best age-defying gifts you can give yourself.

* Avoid processed foods as much as possible. Phosphates fuel the aging process, interfering with vitamin D activation and weakening your bones. Genetically engineered food has also been linked to accelerated aging, so if you do choose processed foods, be sure to opt for organic.

The 55-year-old, who launched his namesake brand in 1992 and has designed over 15,000 shoes and boots since, spoke about it to Vogue magazine, reports femalefirst.co.uk.

“I have no interest in shopping. None. I never go clothes shopping, I have no patience for clothes,” he said. “I’d rather spend time with someone badly dressed but smart and funny and engaging than someone perfectly dressed and boring, who talks about clothes. To me, that’s the image of a nightmare: a woman incredibly well-dressed, who can only talk about clothes. That kills it for me,” he added.

Louboutin has a long list of celebrity clients including Margot Robbie, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Kardashian West, Selena Gomez and Melania Trump. However, he doesn’t fancy partnering with a celebrity for a brand endorsement because it shows a “weakness”.

Get rid of acne by washing your face and hands regularly and use tea tree-based products to regulate sebum production and reduce blemishes, suggest experts. Sargam Dhawan, Director at Paul Penders India and Sharad Kulkarni, Ayurvedic Expert at Kama Ayurveda have shared some tips to get rid of acne organically:

* To keep bacteria at bay, wash your face and hands regularly with the natural antibacterial alpina and tea tree cleansing wash. It contains essential tea-tree oil with a soft, foaming formula that gently and effectively cleanses normal to oily skin. It also helps in regulating sebum production and reducing blemishes. It is made with natural and organic ingredients.

* It is very important to moisturise your skin. Opt for juniper and yarrow moisturiser or aloe and lavender moisturiser as it will also have vitamin E that helps to replenish the moisture to avoid skin dehydration.

* Ayurvedic medication, on the other hand provides a more holistic approach. Bitter gourd juice intake every day acts as a rakta shodhaka (blood purifier) as its anti-bacterial action helps to flush out the free radicals out of the body. Thus, it keeps the skin clean and clear through internal cleansing.

* Start your morning with lots of water. This is known to push toxins out of the body relieving body from the harmful effects of toxins. Toxins are drained out of the body through sweat, urine and bowel. Once the body is detoxed the skin gets the glow. Apart from this fresh fruit juices and other natural sources of fluids are recommended.

"Going back in time, traditional costume fever grips Thailand",https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/going-back-in-time-traditional-costume-fever-grips-thailand/story-4HwYQkvvc4gm13aUw6BQsI.html,"Sun, 08 Apr 2018 08:27:24 GMT","Business is booming for Siri Seatea’s traditional dress shop in Bangkok.

“Out of the 30 years I’ve been running this shop, this is the peak for us,” 53-year-old Siri told Reuters as she stitched a Thai sarong for a client.

History fever is gripping Thailand and a growing number of Thais are wearing traditional dress, a phenomenon encouraged by the junta and the palace, and fuelled by a popular television soap opera.

But the trend, which began with a ‘winter fair’ initiated by King Maha Vajiralongkorn in February, has also been criticised by some as an attempt to glorify an era of absolute monarchy and gloss over the junta’s shortcomings nearly four years after it took power.

“History has long been used by the elite to maintain their status in politics,” said Anusorn Unno, Dean of the Faculty of Sociology and Anthropology at Thammasat University.

“Right now the junta is facing new challenges from a new generation of people so they have retreated to history to say that the past is better and more suitable for Thailand.”

Among the popular costumes are those worn during the reign of former King Chulalongkorn, known as Rama V, who ruled from 1868 to 1910 and is credited with saving Thailand from Western colonialism.

Television has also played a part. Love Destiny, a soap opera set during the 1656 to 1688 reign of King Narai the Great, has taken Thailand by storm. Many Thais are visiting the ancient capital of Ayutthaya, north of Bangkok, where scenes from Love Destiny take place. They pose for selfies dressed in traditional garb against the backdrop of the ruins.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha met with cast members this week at Government House and hailed the series as an example of the government’s longstanding policy of promoting ‘Thai-ness’. Prayuth’s own cabinet has held some recent meetings in the traditional dress of a 19th century elite. He dressed in a buttoned up silk jacket, breeches and a wide sash.

A coup led by Prayuth in 2014 followed months of unrest as demonstrators supporting the urban middle class and military-backed elite demanded the resignation of then-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, whose biggest following was among the rural poor. That long-standing division shows little sign of having disappeared despite four years of military rule.

Although the junta has now promised elections for February 2019, signs of frustration over repeated delays to the ballot have prompted protests in recent weeks.

Costume fever

In Ayutthaya, 80 km (50 miles) north of Bangkok, visitor numbers have nearly tripled since Love Destiny began, according to officials quoted by local media.

“It was booming since the winter fair held by our king and then this soap opera fueled the Thai costume fever,” said Chutima Wongchiangkwang, 55, a costume vendor.

Wearing traditional clothes can get you a discount at the cinema. The country’s Major Cineplex Group announced this week a buy one, get one free promotion. Flight attendants for national carrier Thai Airways International are also dressing up in national costumes from the reign of King Rama V this month to mark the Thai New Year festival known as Songkran.

This weekend, Thais flocked to an event initiated by the king ahead of the Thai new year festival of Songkran - which for many has become a rowdy water-soaked affair. The palace event, over three days, aims to revive a more sedate vision of Thailand’s culture with tribute being paid to past kings, Buddhist rites and displays of folklore.

“The public is encouraged to dress in traditional Thai period costume, wear Thai clothing or polite smart casual attire,” the Thai tourist authority’s news website said. “Water guns and baby powder pasting are discouraged.”

Back at the Siriroong Ruang shop, Maneejan Srilert, 23, an employee at the Stock Exchange of Thailand, eyed a gold and red traditional skirt to wear to an office party.

“I don’t think of it as a political thing,” she told Reuters. “For me it’s just fashion.”

Embrace your curves.

Ritika Taneja, senior director-categories, ShopClues, Natascha Tate, in-house stylist at LimeRoad, and Tanvi Malik, co-founder, FabAlley, list some tips to style plus-size clothing:

* Wear statement jewellery: Highlight your strengths and hide your flaws, by taking the attention away from your weight. Wear statement jewellery like a choker neckpiece with your outfits. It will make you look effortlessly stylish.

* Make black your best friend: Fall in love with darker shades and ditch the pastel shades, as best is the black shade. Black-hued clothes will add glamour style and, of course, make you slimmer.

* Wear shapewear: Invest in a good quality tummy tucker. It will flatten your body and elegantly accentuate the curves.

* Empire line dresses will look flattering: Be it western or ethnic wear, choose tops and kurtas designed in an empire line way. It will look flattering and complement your body type.

* Sheer and summery bodysuits: Pick plunging neck numbers to make sure you give your figure the accentuation it deserves. Pair them up with a rugged blue denim and classic white sneakers.

* Look out for metallic shift dresses: They’re high on shine and high on style, plus, the shift silhouette falls perfectly along the waistline. Make sure you have a stock of good ol’ party pumps to go with them.

* Asymmetrical stripes: Stripes got a bad name in the past, but these days, brands and designers have figured out how to use the optical illusion for good. Asymmetrical stripes make curvy women look svelte and taller. Just look for stripes that angle inward towards your waistline, for a flattering silhouette.

* Monochrome dressing: A monochromatic outfit can do wonders with a linear, long, continued line which is universally flattering. Just ensure that you pick a colour that complements your skin tone and add a colourful accessory to your outfit to keep the look from getting boring.

Dog-sledding in the snow,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/apr/09/dog-sledding-in-the-snow-1799226.html,"Tuesday, April 10, 2018 07:37 AM +0530","KOCHI:The ten Siberian huskies began barking in unison as Balram Menon stepped onto the sled. The time: 10.30 a.m. The place: Gorkhi-Terelj National Park at Mongolia. They set off. On all sides, there was snow and bare brown trees. The temperature was minus 20 degrees even though it was the month of March. Soon, the dogs picked up speed.

The Kochi-based businessman felt thrilled, as they raced through the snowy expanse. “There is a handle which could be used to apply the brakes and control the sledge,” says Balram.A kilometre ahead was a man inside a jeep. “His job was to keep control of the dogs,” says Balram. “If they see some animals they will get distracted and try to attack them. So, he blows the horn and removes the animals from the path. The Huskies are ferocious dogs but they have been trained to be friendly with human beings.”

Suddenly, the sled hit a rock hidden under the snow and Balram went flying. He had a soft landing on the snow. So he got up quickly and chased the sled and managed to get on.

After an hour came the lunch break. A barbeque was lit and meat fried. “I was feeling so hungry the food was welcome,” says Balram. In the end, he traversed 28 kms before the journey came to an end.

Balram got interested in going to Mongolia when he saw a dog-sled video on Facebook. The page belonged to a man called Bold Purvedelgar from Mongolia. So Balram contacted Bold. “He is one of the few Mongolians who can speak English,” says Balram. “He told me to come to Mongolia and would arrange everything.”

Asked about the temperature, Bold said that it varied from -20 to -40 degrees Centigrade. “He asked whether I could cope with that,” says Balram. “I told him I was prepared for the challenge.”

In the end, Balram had to wear five layers of thermal clothing. As for the route, since there is no direct flight from Kochi to Mongolia, Balram flew to Colombo. From there, he went to Bangkok, Beijing and then to Mongolia. “It took around 18 hours,” he says.

Apart from dog sledding, Balram tried paragliding. This was at Tsaonjin Boldog Province, around 100km from the country’s capital Ulaanbaatar. “We had to walk up a mountain and then run on a flat ground and leap into the air,” he says. “It was very exciting.”

Another highlight was visiting the huge statue of Genghis Khan (1162-1227), the founder of the Mongol Empire at Tsaonjin Boldog. “It is the world’s tallest equestrian statue,” says Balram. “The horse is 120 feet high. The statue is made of stainless steel.”

Khan is regarded as the father of the nation. “While the rest of the world thinks he was a terror, for the Mongolians he is a hero,” says Balram. “He had the largest army in the world and conquered large areas of Asia and Europe.”

Genghis was following a religion called Shamanism, through which you interact with spirits. “Before embarking on a war, he would communicate with the spirits, so that he would get an idea of whether he can win the war or not,” says Balram. “But after the conquest of Mongolia by Russia (1921-24), shamanism was completely destroyed.”

But the traditional food and culture survive. Balram stayed in a tent, called Ger, which is made of horse skin and hair. “It offers a good protection against the cold,” says Balram. “They have small ovens and use horse dung for fire. But there is no electricity, no digital communications and no bathrooms. You have to go out into the forest to do your ablutions.”

The food is unique and different. The staple food is steam dumplings. During winter, they have meat products, so that they can feel warm. And in summer it is cheese. There is also a national drink called airag, which is made from the fermented milk of a mare. “It is highly alcoholic in content,” says Balram. “One sip is enough to send you floating.”As for the attitude of the people towards Indians, Balram says, “They feel an affinity because the people of the North-East of India look like them.”","On all sides, there was snow and bare brown trees.

For some, it is the time to tick movies off their watchlist. For others, ‘tis the season to ‘kill and destroy’ on video games. Whatever the city kids do to pass their time, it involves this.

Picture this. On a fine sunny morning, children between the age of six and 12 are sitting on the edge of a pond with their fishing rods in their hand. Deep in thoughts, they are patiently waiting for the fish to get hooked on the bait. This would probably be the first time in a long time that they have heads engrossed in something other than the apps on their smartphones.

Now wait, don’t be so sceptical about it. Because the primary school students in Kochi will be given the opportunity to try their hand in traditional fishing. The initiative is organised by the Tourist Desk in Ernakulam Boat Jetty, in association with the State Tourism Department.

The initiative was inaugurated on Monday at 4 pm. The facility is made available in the temporary nursery pond set up at the jetty. ‘Angling’ or traditional way of fishing is a major tourism activity in Western countries. The Tourism Department has found even though Kerala is the land of water bodies, the state is at the bottom of the list when it comes to Angling tourism. The initiative will make children aware of the job opportunities in Angling tourism and pisciculture.

The fishing activity will be open to children from 11 am to 7 pm every day. Fees to take part in the two-hour activity is `25. For more details, contact 9847044688.","KOCHI:With the break of the century, vacations have been the season when children kill their time with technology.

And, considering the fact that not all can afford expensive tour packages, City Express presents a slew of options in and around Thiruvananthapuram district where one could easily plan an one-day excursion, while not burning a hole in your pocket as well.

Thiruvananthapuram city

Not many would give visit to Padmanabha Swamy Temple a miss if they land in the capital. But, the place has more to offer, than just the temple and here are a few places that can be edifying and entertaining at the same time.

Kerala legislature golden jubilee museum

It displays photos, objects and artifacts that show the rich heritage of democratic institutions of the land. According to officials, the museum provides the visitor with a deep insight into the history of Kerala Assembly. Working hours : 11 am to 4 pm on all working days. Admission is free.

The palace is constructed using teak-wood, rosewood, marble, and granite. It houses idols and sculptures made from white marble, Kathakali figures, Belgian mirrors and paintings. The palace is also famous for its 122 smiling wooden horses. Visiting hours: 08:30 - 13:00 hrs & 15:00 - 17:30 hrs. Closed on Mondays. Contact details: 0471 2473952

Meshan Mani

Located on the eastern side of the Padmanabha Swamy Temple, it has on its dial a man’s face with two goats on either side. Every time the clock completes an hour, the man opens his mouth and the goats hit his cheeks. The clock was said to be installed in 1833 during the reign of Swathi Thirunal. However, officials says the clock is not working properly at present.

Madavoorpara

Situated about 20 km from the capital city, it is 300-feet above sea level. The place is noted for its cave temple and bamboo bridge. The rock cut Shiva Temple here dates back to the 9th Century CE. The rock shrine, currently under the protection of the Department of Archeology, has a pillar with inscriptions in Vattezhuthu, the ancient Malayalam script. The 100-m long bamboo bridge here is also a sight in itself.

Vellanickal

25 km from Thiruvananthapuram. A good place to witness the sunset. It also provides the ambience of a hill station. There is also a hilltop temple, called Paramukal Kovil (hilltop temple) dedicated to Thampuran. It is, however, open only on Fridays. Meanwhile, it is advisable to visit the place in large groups as the place is rather remote.","It’s that time of the year when families plan holiday trips.

‘Thailand great for differently-abled’,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/apr/09/thailand-great-for-differently-abled-1799201.html,"Tuesday, April 10, 2018 07:30 AM +0530","BENGALURU : Travelling can be an enriching experience. While we able-bodied people look at ensuring we get the right facilities, visit the best spots and are carrying the right luggage with us when we travel, those who are differently-abled might find difficulty doing the little things while on a trip that we tend to overlook. In spite of their disabilities, these courageous people have travelled to multiple places across the globe. At a recent event called ‘Travel Tales’ in the city, City Express chatted with a few people with disabilities on the challenges and triumphs while going on holiday.

Mrinamayi Abroal, who also has a blog documenting her travel tales, says she has been to a lot of places in India and abroad. Being a wheelchair user, she claims travelling in Rajasthan has been her best experience so far. “I found a lot of places that were accessible there. The gardens of most of the tourist spots were accessible, however, the palaces that require some movement cannot be made accessible, and that’s fair.”

“I haven’t travelled too much, but my trip to Pondicherry was a great experience. I saw the sea and the ocean after a long time. I have also travelled to a couple of places in Karnataka. It was a good experience and now I plan to travel on my own. I plan to travel to Jaipur and Kerala this year, “ says Jyothishree SP.

Ajmal Mohammad is hearing-impaired, and has engaged himself in training people on how to use sign language, having recently stepped out of his home, he says, “I’m basically from Kerala.

I have travelled by bike with my friends. I would wonder how it would be possible to travel and communicate with people. Somehow I figured that acting would do, and via acting, I made it possible to communicate. Language is not important; it is about how efficiently you communicate. With the help of that, he first travelled to and from Bengaluru on his birthday.”

What is interesting to note about these anecdotes is that out of the many places that claim to be accessible, there are only a few that actually are. Disability rights activist Virali Modi shares her travel experiences, and claims the accessibility in Thailand is a notch higher than most tourist spots, she says, “My trip to Thailand was one of the best I’ve had so far. Most places there are made accessible.”

Enable Travels works towards making travel accessible for people with disabilities. Urvashi Kamat from Enable Travel, says, “We try and provide travel and leisure experiences to people who are in wheelchairs, visually-impaired and those who are deaf. We also started this for senior citizens. We have a panel of disable experts. We have three wheelchair experts, two visually-impaired experts, and we also have a deaf expert. We tell them to have a look at all our tools and tell us how accessible they are, or how accessible they are not.”","In spite of their disabilities, these courageous people have travelled to multiple places across the globe.

Vaishali VIjaykumar lists out summer picnic spots to rest, relax and rejuvenate.

CHEMBARAMBAKAM

Why should you go: Lakes are the new favourites among vacation seekers. Chennai boasts three lakes that are a must visit. Situated near the central prison is Puzhal, which has a huge dam and lake. Red Hills lake is another name to it. It is one of the two rain-fed reservoirs in the city while the other ones are Porur and Chembarambakam lake.

How to reach there: Puzhal is 14 km, and Chembarambakam is 25 km from Chennai.

Sadras fort

Why should you go: There are quite a few chances of missing out the Sadras fort, located on the outskirts of the atomic research centre near Kalpakkam. The fort has a huge tomb and also houses a cemetery. While it might not be on the top of your list to visit a cemetry, the green goodness in the area is enough to sedate your senses. A one-day picnic here is sure to give you enough rest and relaxation.

History: Modern Sadras was established as a part of the Dutch Coromandel in the 17th century. It was earlier a centre for weaving muslin cloth, which was exported, besides pearl and oil. It was built by the Dutch for commercial purposes. According to historians, the fort takes its name after a Vishnu temple, Sadurangapattinam, and was later shortened as Sadras.

How to reach there: It is 70 km from Chennai. Buses are available.

Dakshinachitra

You can either drive down the Old Mahabalipuram Road or take one of the buses. It’s a one-hour ride.

Pulicat lake

Why should you go: Pulicat is considered to be the second largest brackish water lake in the country. With about 186 species of fishes reported, this place is a major hub for fishing. If you’re a seafood and crustacean lover then you have more reasons to visit this lake. This wetland is also one of the most important migratory routes for birds. The Wildlife Division of ths state has listed about 115 varieties of birds. The Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary is also located in this catchment area. This is one of the best spots for birdwatchers.

Seventy kilometres further down will take you to Puducherry. And a few kilometres before you hit Mahabalipuram is the Tiger Cave. It’s a common sight to find families enjoying their packed meals here on their day out.



History: Once a navigation port, it is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its origin dates back to 700 AD. Most of us would have read about the Pallavas and the Cholas in our history textbooks. The shore temple is one of their creations. Every granite piece of stone here has carvings of mythological deities. Pancha Rathas and Descent of the Ganges are the standalone pieces; it’s hard to miss them.

How to reach: Mahabalipuram is 60 km southwest of Chennai on the Coromandel Coast. You can either drive or take one of the frequent buses by the East Coast Road and Rajiv Gandhi State Highway.



Covelong

Why should you go: If you’re a water baby, a sports enthusiast, and love surfing then Covelong is where you should be at, this summer. The beach is one of the few places in the city where you can try wind surfing. And if surfing doesn't interest you, check out kayaking, boating and other water sports activities.

Footsteps beyond the sand,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/apr/07/footsteps-beyond-the-sand-1797545.html,"Saturday, April 7, 2018 01:02 PM +0530","Karma for marine life watchers is seeing shoals of iridescent fish shivering through the currents, octopuses squirting black ink upon sensing human intrusion, jelly fish opening their colourful bouquets and sleek dolphins skimming the surface of the ocean to disappear again in a flash of dark silver. Narara, located 60 km from Jamnagar is part of the Marine National Park situated on the southern shore of Gulf of Kutch in Gujarat, where marine life can be seen in their natural habitat without having to snorkel or scuba-dive in the sea. The way to the seaside of the Gulf of Kutch is lined with mangroves and their aerial roots suspended. Mangroves can survive in extreme conditions, be it saline or with less oxygen.

They are also considered sentinels that protect the coast from natural disasters such as tsunamis, cyclones and hurricanes, and guard the coastline by slowing the speed of winds as well as waves. A closer look at the sand reveals trails left by small shells, each a home to a tiny hermit crab.Depending on the season, Flamingoes and Pelicans appear in saltpans just before reaching Narara.

“The recommended time to visit Narara is 3.5 hours after the high tide. It is when the tide ebbs and the reef is exposed. Also ensure that you leave the reef 3.5 hours before the next high tide. Wear sun hats and caps. Footwear should be waterproof and closed ones preferably. Remember not to wear flip flops as they get stuck in the mud,” advises veteran guide Mustak Mepani who has been organising marine and bird trips around Jamnagar for the past two decades.

As the water recedes, left behind are channels of seawater and rock pools filled with sea plants resembling cartilages, and colourful sponges growing on sea rocks, while seaweed and moss interrupt the spaces in between. And the beach floods with more birds than have been seen in months, feeding on the bodies of creatures abandoned by the tide. The Gulf of Kutch is home to 52 species of hard coral and 12 species of soft corals apart from diverse flora and fauna. It generally takes four-five hours to explore the 2.5 km coral walk at Narara.

Spotting crabs is easy here. A blue coloured crustacean could be a Neptune crab, which is named after the god of the sea, though the connection is not apparent. Another crab found here is the Wolf crab which sports brown spiky hair. Much of the marine fauna here shelter under the rocks during the day, away from the burning sun. Sabella is a deceptive denizen of the sea, resembling a fern in appearance but is actually a worm. It is the ‘touch me not’ of the ocean. Once it senses your approach, it quickly disappears into the seabed. Sea anemones have a symbiotic relationship with shrimps and often, a shrimp or two can be found in their company. “These anemone shrimps are naturally painted with hues of yellow, white and black. They are so transparent that one can even see their brains,” explains Mustak.

Puffer fish are more elusive and are well versed in the art of deception that evolution has trained them in millennia ago. When they feel threatened, they puff themselves up by drinking water and ballooning up to twice their original size as their name suggests. As one ventures deeper into the sea bed, the water becomes clearer, the seaweeds are more abundant and more coral is visible in colourful clusters of green, brown, and white. Their shapes vary from the human brain to stars and even the moon. Avian life at Narara includes Crab Plovers, Sand Plovers, Oyster Catchers, Ruddy Turnstones, Red Shanks, Green Shanks, Terns, Storks and Egrets.

The best experience in witnessing and learning about marine life is gained when it is done at one’s own pace. At Narara there is no guessing what will be found next and where. On Mother Nature’s own treasure hunt, there are surprises tucked in nooks and crevices of the Gujarat coast.","The way to the seaside of the Gulf of Kutch is lined with mangroves and their aerial roots suspended.

Tadipatri temple tales are waiting to be heard,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/mar/30/tadipatri-temple-tales-are-waiting-to-be-heard-1794853.html,"Sunday, April 1, 2018 03:00 PM +0530","CHENNAI: Sculptures are like photographs from the past,” said historian Chithra Madhavan as she addressed the city’s heritage enthusiasts at Tattvaloka as part of her illustrated lecture on Vijayanagara architecture and sculptures in South India (temples of Tadipatri).

Walking us through two ancient temples in Tadipatri — Chintala Venkataramana Swamy temple and Bugga Ramalingeswara Swamy temple, she drew connections on how architectural styles of the Vijayanagara empire was absorbed by artists and sculptors in different parts of South India. “Both these temples have several sculptures of parrots. It isn’t a common sight in temples now,” she said pointing to the image on the screen.

The Venkataramana Swamy temple houses several rare imagery and sculptures of Gods. Chithra pointed to one rare image of Vishnu with many arms. “Here, he is Venugopala/Krishna with the flute, and Rama, holding the bow and arrow,” she said.

The temple also holds a chariot-shaped shrine for Garuda, which is intricately carved in granite — a reminiscent of the famous Garuda mandapa in the Vittala Temple, Hampi. “This Garuda mandapa in Tadipatri is perhaps even more beautiful than the one in Hampi. But unfortunately, no one visits Tadipatri,” she rued.

Shedding light on the similarities between the Venkataramana Swamy temple and Hazara Rama temple, Hampi, the seat of the Vijayanagara empire, she said, “The outer wall of Hazara Rama temple, is covered in panels that depict the Ramayana. This temple has that as well but, it’s more intricate and a few panels have inscriptions that describes the scene.” It also has a rare sculpture of ‘Jatayu Moksham’ and the Goddess in the Anandavalli sanctum is in a standing position, which is rare.

The Bugga Ramalingeswara temple is a 16th century protected heritage site. Its breathtaking gopurams, intricately carved sculptures, musical stone pillars and its location — on the banks of the Penna river — make it a must visit site for one to soak in it’s architectural grandeur. “This temple has intricate designs on granite. We have to stop and look at the Temples and gopurams. They have so much to offer,” she said, pointing to the image of a female dancer, clad in a short pleated dance skirt. “There are musicians in this sculpture following the dancer. This was common in the 16th century The same imagery can be seen in the Mahanavami Dibba in Hampi,” she shared.

While the architecture and sculptures of temples are noticed sometimes, scant attention is given to inscriptions. “The British told that we don’t have a sense of history. Maybe we didn’t do it like how the Greeks and Romans did but, we had our own indigenous way of documenting and those are these inscriptions. I urge everyone to visit the Tadipatri temples for they are treasure troves of history,” she said.

"Staycations, solo travel: Travel trends for long weekends",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/mar/31/staycations-solo-travel-travel-trends-for-long-weekends-1795192.html,"Saturday, March 31, 2018 04:14 PM +0530","NEW DELHI: To loosen up and de-stress, millennials have understood that travelling is the best therapy. Utilising long weekends, Indians are exploring more offbeat locations rather than going to another city with the same hustle bustle, say experts.



Dhruv Raj Gupta, Founder and CEO, TripShelf and Dhruv Sharma, CEO and Founder of GuestHouser, have listed few travel trends this year:



* Staycation is in: Staycation or staying in the same city has undergone a very interesting paradigm shift due to over-tourism. Travellers are increasingly seeking out relaxed, luxury stays at holiday homes around them in the same city.



* Choosing home stays over hotels: A growing population of well-travelled urban millennials has grown tired of conventional tourism; which focuses on the simple historical sightseeing and standardized hotel rooms.



This population is looking for something more personal and unique wherein they can take a dip in an unfamiliar culture, and experience it by living with a native family. They also look forward to eating authentic food of the place they're visiting and home stays thus prove to be a good option.



* Exotic or offbeat destinations: Stress busting and exploring unexplored places are the two top reasons for travel on long weekends amongst millennials instead of catching up with friends, research or writing.



From quaint solo getaways to off-season mountain escapes and immersive adventures, urban millennials are not nervous about trying unexplored places. They prefer short backpacking trips with just 2-3 nights to stay, and don't mind taking overnight buses or road trips to destinations within a distance of 400 km from Delhi.



* Last minute travel: With the upswing of various online portals and last-minute attractive deals, spontaneous trips are trending among millennials and they don't hesitate in making plans on the go. Bookings are made less than 24 hours before the trip to various off beat locations.



* Solo travel on an all-time high: With an all-time high number of people travelling solo, the travel industry has completely transformed to enrich the experience of young solo explorers. These young travellers engage in enriching experiences, learning new skills, immerse themselves in culture while they are out there exploring.



The solo excursion helps in a personalized experience that is curated based on individual likes and preferences.



* Wellness retreat: As people are taking care of their mental health and are paying it equal attention to as their physical health, wellness trips are taking a huge hike. The goal is to be more mentally sound and relaxed before returning to the routine life.



Activities like yoga, meditation, hiking, surfing, long treks or even running are the focus of such trips to reduce stress. Various places like Rishikesh, Gokarna, Coimbatore and Mysore have amazing wellness retreats.","Utilising long weekends, Indians are exploring more offbeat locations rather than going to another city with the same hustle bustle, say experts.

* Going to the beach for holidays? Then pull out your sundresses. Pair them up with strappy sandals, oversized sunglasses, and a straw tote bag. Men can go for nautical prints, solid pastel-hued shorts and espadrilles.



* If you want to explore cities like Paris and Rome, opt for outfits with a single colour palette and accessorise with a silk scarf or a barrette to keep it elegant. Skip the heels and pick the ballerinas. Guys, pack your Breton tees, pinstriped trousers and classy loafers.



* Adventure on your mind? Equip yourself with quick-drying cargo shorts or fashionable elastic bottom trousers; you can opt for any of them. Hiking boots are a must as is a pair of flip-flops. If you're heading into the deep woods, then steer away from attention-grabbing bright colours and opt for earthy tones.



* While packing for your mountain trip, it is important to take into account unexpected changes in weather, so pack clothes that can be easily layered to accommodate the change-jackets, mufflers and socks. Also remember to carry a pair of comfortable jeans and a pair of boots.","NEW DELHI: Whether you are planning a quick weekend getaway, road trip or a week-long holiday, don't leave your fashion quotient behind, say, experts.

The Cacao Trail at Varanashi Farms that meanders through 50 acres of sprawling verdant plantations, is unlike the conventional cacao trails in Costa Rica or Peru. It takes visitors through farm and forest land to educate them on organic farming.

“The certified organic farm was conceptualised in 1993, but the chocolate walk is for children’ say the owners and researcher-farmer couple—Varanashi Krishna Moorthy and Ashwini K Moorthy—who have doctorate degrees from Mangalore University.

Varanashi Krishna Moorthy at the tree

house, located 40 ft from the ground

A third-generation farmer, Krishna Moorthy explains that many children are unaware that chocolate comes from the simple little bean—cacao. Kids find this out soon enough on the Cacao Trail which ends up at the manufacturing unit of Campco chocolate factory on the premises. Here, the precise and scientific process transformation of beans into cocoa powder and chocolate are unravelled for the children.

Children also get to see the dairy unit, bio-gas (of capacity 10 cubic), slurry tank (used as organic fertiliser), production of bio-organic manure and rainwater harvesting systems (three-fourth of rain water in the farm is drained to recharge ground water table).

The Moorthys gained their expertise by touring over 15 countries, and diversified into eco-tourism. Son Partha Varanashi, a post graduate in Biotech from Australia manages the project. The lush green property has five natural tanks and ponds. The Varanashi home stay includes dormitories and a tree houses that can accommodate between 50-60 guests. “We are planning to set up tents soon,’’ says Krishna Moorthy.

Ashwini adds that outdoor activities such geo caching, mud volley ball, rope swinging, swimming, kayaking, flying fox, stand-up paddle, cycling, and hiking through the forest give vamp guests the au naturel experience. Explorations of nearby water caves are conducted under the supervision of Partha, who is an internationally certified swimming coach. There is enough to occupy the inquisitive types, who can stroll through the trees looking for butterflies and discover over 40 varieties of exotic birds.

However, the tree house is offered as a highlight at the home stay. The large tree houses, like the ‘Devadaru’ are built with locally available wood It stands about 40 ft high and has 200 sq ft of cosy space that can accommodate up to five people.

“The sunlight streaming through the canopies of the trees and a panoramic view of the setting sun made us feel we were the luckiest people in the world,’’ said a techie couple from Bangaluru who had rented Devadaru.

The menu at Varansahi Farms comprises local delicacies which have distinct aromas and flavours. All the produce used in cooking is grown organically.

While many such places offer outdoor experiences, Charlie and Chocolate factory in a Karnataks forest gives kids more than just play and TV.

Tariff: `1,800 per person for dormitory use; `6,000 for the tree house. The charges are inclusive of breakfast, lunch and dinner.

A legacy left behind,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/mar/23/a-legacy-left-behind-1791539.html,"Saturday, March 24, 2018 04:50 PM +0530","CHENNAI:On an evening rush hour, I am standing amid the choked Triplicane high road — a concrete jungle with nothing but chaos, that’s often romanticised as ‘glorious traffic’. Trying to find my way to a famous heritage hotel, a haven for weary travellers from across the globe, I walk across the ‘burqa’ shops and hotels and a few minutes later, I reach ‘Broadlands’ lodging house, located in the quaint Vallabha Agraharam street. Standing in front of the facade of the unassuming building erected in the 19th century, we are welcomed by a board mounted on the wall right above the sit out, which reads: ‘Welcome, Namaste! Traveller!’.

As soon as we enter the building, it seems like we have stepped inside a time capsule — multiple courtyards, shutter windows and doors, stained glasses from a bygone era, antique furniture, crumbling lime plaster walls and a comforting blue, green and pink paint give us a welcoming taste of its old world charm. An enthusiastic staff member welcomes us and while we wait to meet its owner, the friendly banter of the guests keeps us engaged.

Clad in a red t-shirt and jeans, Krishna Rao, the third generation owner of the lodge welcomes us in. “My grandfather was from Andhra but had strong business ties here,” he says. According to Krishna, the building came into the family’s possession as part of a business deal or a bank auction. “Unfortunately, most Indian families have neglected to educate the next generations about their origins and history. So, what I know of this building’s history is very limited,” he explains.

Krishna Rao’s family came into possession of the building in 1951 from the ‘Badsha’ family, post which it was converted into a hostel and later into a lodge. “Law college students used to stay here when it was a hostel. Many even went on to become Supreme Court judges in the 90s and 2000s. This building is now a part of our family’s legacy and we haven’t changed anything here. Everything is intact, just like how we got it. With occasional maintenance and renovation work, the building is in great condition,” he beams as he walks us through the building.

Paintings and photographs from travellers are mounted on walls and as we progress from one courtyard to another (of a total three), it’s evident that the house gets bigger as we go further. “The current entrance of the building used to be the back or servant entrance before we took over the building. The main entrance opens to the big mosque but, we have always kept that closed. That’s why this part of the building is bigger,” he explains as we go up the labyrinth staircase.

“We really don’t know what the original history of the building is. Perhaps the previous owners could shed light on that,” he says, as we stand on the terrace of the building, watching the sunset, with a view of the big mosque, LIC building, Secretariat and Raheja Towers.

As questions of the larger part of the origin of the building shroud us, Krishna Rao offers us the number of a 66-year-old Faiz Badsha Sayeed, a fourth generation descendant of the Badsha family.A couple of phone calls later, along with Krishna, we land at the house of Faiz, in Triplicane. Seated in the hall with a stack of old photographs, a trade book about the family’s Mica business, Faiz along with his elder brother Faud walk us through the history of the building, which once was a link between Madras and Turkey. The now Broadlands was once the ‘Le Consulat de Turquie a Madras’ or the Turkish Consulate in Madras! Faiz narrates, “Our great grandfather Haji Mohammed Badsha Sahib is where the family root began. He was a very ‘normal man’ but, he got lucky when a piece of cloth, possibly indigo dyed, fetched him a fortune from Britain.”

The history of the building which once opened its gates to foreign dignitaries is lost somewhere in time. “We are old and there’s only so much we can recollect about its history. We hope that the next generation takes it up and tries to document more about the heritage of the building and the family,” says Faiz, as he shows us a vintage picture of the consulate in all its glory, taken from the main entrance. “It’s funny that we have never been inside the building. We would like to visit Broadlands someday,” smiles Faiz looking at Krishna as he gives an affirming nod.

TRIVIA

Haji Mohammed Badsha went on to become one the richest businessman in South India and founded the Messrs H Mohammed Badsha Sahib & Co, a leading textile firm. “He was the one who built this building back in the 1800s. It was also his personal residence and my grandfather MA Khuddus Badsha Sahib and his brother Abdul Azeez Badsha Sahib were born in that building,” shares Faiz about his grandfather Khuddus, who was the seventh son of Mohammed Badsha. “He was also one of the founders of the Indian Bank and served as the Vice-Consul at the Turkish Consulate in Madras. This is just the tip of the iceberg Berg, he wore several hats,” beams Faiz.","According to Krishna, the building came into the family’s possession as part of a business deal or a bank auction.

But now a Whatsapp group formed by the tourism police has made things easy. The group called ‘Guest Care’ was formed in 2017 and has helped police reach out to tourists who have been harassed by anti-social elements or cheated by traders.

“We have police officers, tourist authorities, hoteliers, guides, counsellors and homestay operators as members of the group ‘Guest Care’. Usually, the tourists prefer to share their distress with the hoteliers and homestays first. So any issues related to foreigners can be informed through this WhatsApp group. Once the information is passed, the police promptly reach the hotel or homestay and try to solve the issue,” said V B Rashid, sub inspector, Tourism Police Station.

There are around 300 homestays operating in Mattancherry and Fort Kochi. Along with it around 30 luxury and semi-luxury hotels are there at the tourist destination. “Last year following an information provided by a Guest Care group, a person who was abusing a foreigner was nabbed. We conduct meetings with the homestays and hoteliers on a regular basis. We insist the tourist operators pass on any information regarding crime against tourists. Similarly, the patrolling work throughout the day ensures the safety of tourists,” he said.

Police Museum

Police Museum close to Tourism Police Station is becoming a popular destination for those visiting Fort Kochi and Mattancherry. The museum showcases the history of Kerala police - pre and post independence.

There are a collection of uniforms from the era of Travancore kings to the present. Similarly, swords used by cops during the Travancore Kingdom, hats used by police officers, different types of canes, antique pistols and binoculars are also on display. At the entrance, there is a replica of a policeman from the Travancore King’s rule holding a spear. The entry to the museum is free. The museum is open from 9.30 am to 6 pm daily.","KOCHI: Monitoring and dealing with every tourist arriving at Mattancherry and Fort Kochi is not an easy task.

A handbook for a Himalayan journey,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/mar/22/a-handbook-for-a-himalayan-journey-1791112.html,"Saturday, March 24, 2018 06:54 AM +0530","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Pilgrimage to the Himalayas is everybody ‘s dream. The snow-clad mountains always beckon the pilgrims and tourists. Now there is help at hand. The ‘Himalayan Yatra, A Handbook’ by Babu John, a native of Palamukku in Pathanamthitta district has turned out to be a gift for those who want to undertake a trip.

While most of the books based on Himalayan experiences deal with its mystic beauty Babu’s book is noted for its direct narrative style. “Once you see the pristine beauty of the Himalayan ranges and awe-inspiring peaks set against the blue sky, you cannot escape from its magic grip. However, tourists and pilgrims who go there are often not aware of the hostile weather conditions, the tough mode of travel, the distance between various towns and villages, refuelling points, boarding and lodging facilities, hospitals and other essential facilities,” says Babu.

At the same time, Babu speaks about the legends, history and myths of the Himalayas.

Starting with a reference to the Thapovanaswamikal (1889-1957), Babu shows his adoration of explorers of earlier times like Rajan Kakkkanadan.

There are graphic details of the journey to Haridwar, Rishikesh, Yamunotri, Gangotri, Badrinath and Kedarnath. Important information like mode of transport, approximate distance, and travel fares have also been given.

Apart from all this, there are useful descriptions about the hill town of Uttarkashi. But at the same time, Babu has taken care to let us have a glimpse into the colonial past of the town with references to British era hotels like Charle Ville, which has been currently converted to the Civil Service Academy at Mussoorie.

He also describes the experience of dipping in the chilling lakes at Gomukh and streams at Thapovan in subzero temperatures. Babu also provides a description of the Thruyugi Narayan temple, Madhya Maheswar, and Thunganath, the highest peak in Uttarakhand at 12073 ft and his commentary on the Chandrasila bathed moonlight located near Thunganath. It will make the reader yearn for the ethereal beauty of the Himalayas.

His lonely and adventurous journey into the Valley of flowers and the description about the Mana village, the last Indian village before the border of China will give the readers an opportunity to have a glimpse at the flora and fauna of the Himalayas. Further, he has included photos of the Neelakanta parvatham, Kedarnath, Badari, Rudraprayag and other holy places as well as the origins of the Yamuna river.","The snow-clad mountains always beckon the pilgrims and tourists.

"Oh, to be in London!",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/mar/24/oh-to-be-in-london-1791593.html,"Saturday, March 24, 2018 06:51 AM +0530","HYDERABAD: For my second visit to the UK, I was well prepared: I binge- watched The Crown to sustain the mood and the flavour of the British. I also watched Victoria and Abdul on the Emirates flight, to add further fervour - though the film didn’t contribute to the quaintest admiration for the monarchy. I liked the film, fell in love with Ali Fazal, thanks to Dame Judi Dench’s extraordinary histrionics, I could see Queen Victoria from a different angle and empathise.

I took a train from Manchester and reached London on a cold, blustery forenoon. When I got into the cab in Euston, after a while Lee (the driver) and I started talking about London, the newly coming up bicycle lanes causing traffic jams; chicken tikka masala, and the beautiful monuments on the way. Then I asked in all my enthusiasm, if he was excited about the royal wedding, and planned to watch it live? He said in all seriousness, “Why? I had rather watch a football match instead!” This had almost stumped me. I met a Britisher who’s not a fan of the royalty.

My guide in London, Marguerite Ryder-Large, a Blue Badge tourist guide, expertly steered me through the busiest streets, and ‘crowded to the brim’ London tube stations: weaving in and out, her large frame leading with confidence and authority, while I followed, juggling with two bags, a heavy camera and an umbrella. The city is simply overwhelming even if you are visiting for the nth time. Though I have seen most of the touristy places during my last trip, I was awestruck by the city’s magnificence.

In London, every corner has some relevance to history, literature or something that I can always relate to. It just feels like connecting the dots… every place brings back memories of a novel or a book that I read fondly or a film that I watched and remembered dearly…most of the places give me a déja vu feeling.

London offers different types of walks depending on our interest – in these guided walking tours we can explore alleys that are keyholes into London’s past. I chose “Charles Dickens Walk” to experience the Dickensian London that I read so much about and imagined. Being an ardent Dickens fan, I read almost all of his books. This tour takes you to the Dickensian landmarks in London, the places that feature in his books. Marguerite and I got down at the Embankment Station close to the polish factory where Dickens worked as a young boy. My heart went out to the poor little boy.

Then we went to 15, Buckingham Street, where he lodged briefly and the hero of his novel ‘David Copperfield’ also lived here - it is said the book is his veiled autobiography. We stopped briefly at Rules Restaurant, Maiden Lane. It is London’s oldest restaurant: Dickens had his own table on the first floor at the back. The smartly dressed guard Attila Bodis is from Slovakia and he was so happy when I told him that I visited his country and liked Bratislava, where he hails from. He spoke fondly about his hometown, and immediately sent me a friend request on Facebook: now we are FB friends!

We went past St. Mary-Le-Strand where Dickens’s parents were married and then headed to 26, Wellington Street – Dickens’s last address in London that housed the offices of Dickens’s Magazine “All the Year Round” and his private apartments from 1859 to 1870 as the blue plaque on the wall says. I was most curious to see Covent Garden Piazza - the notorious Bermondsey slum featured in Oliver Twist.

It was here that Dickens worked as a child labourer and looked longingly at the fresh pineapples in the marketplace; years later he had his offices here; then we saw the Bow Street police station, where the ‘Artful Dodger’ was brought after being caught by the Coppers in Oliver Twist. In 1879, the court moved across the road to its current location, opposite the Royal Opera House (Dickens often visited this place).

We also went around Lincoln’s Inn, which featured in his Bleak House; “The Old Curiosity Shop” where “Little Nell” lived; and lastly 48, Doughty Street, where Dickens lived from 1837-39. Now it is a museum, but more about it later.

The British Museum is dedicated to human history, art and culture. Its permanent collection, numbering some eight million works, is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence and originates from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present. Almost the whole world is featured here and Marguerite knows the museum like the back of her hand! She said, “Many people don’t know that in London 20 museums are free, open every day of the week- people can make use of these free entries and benefit.”

I thought it’s a valid point. The museum is like a large ocean packed with information and our Indian gallery is with precious Indian artefacts. Then we called it a day and came back to my hotel, which is close by in Harrington Gardens, Kensington: tired with processing so much information in my small head, that night I went to sleep, thinking of Dickens.

Rajamahendravaram set to regain its cultural glory,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/mar/23/rajamahendravaram-set-to-regain-its-cultural-glory-1791333.html,"Friday, March 23, 2018 06:17 AM +0530","The old municipal corporation building, which was constructed during the British period, to be developed into a museum | Express

RAJAMAHENDRAVARAM: Rajamahendravaram, cultural capital of the State, is known for its old traditions, culture and practices. The historical town, named after Raja Raja Narendra nearly a thousand years ago, was known as Rajamahendravaram, which the British found it difficult to pronounce and changed it to Rajahmundry. The State government in October 2015 issued a G.O. No. 1017 renaming ‘Rajahmundry’ city as ‘Rajamahendravaram’.

Now, the Rajamahendravaram Municipal Corporation (RMC) is taking steps to restore the past glory of Rajamahendravaram and develop it as a great tourist hub within an year.

The civic body has prepared estimates with an outlay of `40 crore to protect the cultural heritage of the city. It is planning to develop the old municipal corporation building, which was constructed during the British period, into a museum.

Kambala Cheruvu and AB Nageswara Rao parks would be developed to attract visitors.

According to available information, Kotipalli area, which was visited by Mahatma Gandhi during Quit India movement and Devi Chowk area, which was earlier called as Lantern Street, as lanterns were used to decorate the street to welcome Vijayanagara kings, would also be developed into tourist spots.

The RMC is also planning to develop Godavari bund area and instal a statue of Kandukuri Veeresalingam in the city.

Tourist spots

Havelock Bridge: The construction of the bridge commenced on November 11, 1897 and opened for traffic on August 30, 1900. The Bridge was named after Sir Arthur Elibank Havelock, the then Governor of Madras. Having served its full life span of 100 years, it was decommissioned in 1997.

One can get the best view of this bridge during the evenings from Pushkar Ghat.

Watching the sunset over the bridge during the evenings is simply a mesmerising experience.

Kotilingeswara Temple: According to the historians, the temple was constructed between the 10th and 11th centuries. There is a ferry point here, from where one can get a country boat to travel to the small riverine islands.

Kandukuri Veeresalingam Town Hall: It is a cultural centre of yesteryears built by the loving son of Rajamahendravaram, Kandukuri Veeresalingam Pantulu. He was the great social reformer, who fought for education for women and remarriage of widows. He was considered the father of renaissance in Andhra. He wrote the first Telugu novel Rajasekhara Charitam. The tourists can visit the house where Veeresalingam lived in, the place where the first widow marriage took place and also the printing press used by him, in the city.

Dowleswaram Barrage: Dowleswaram is the village at which Godavari river splits into two streams or distributaries, ‘Gautami’ on left and ‘Vasistha’ on the right. An irrigation engineer, Sir Arthur Cotton constructed the barrage across this river. The total height of the masonry structure was 15 feet. A museum in the memory of Sir Arthur Cotton was constructed here. It narrates the stories behind this barrage and it is the only civil engineering museum in the State.

Other places to visit: ISKCON temple, Damerla Rama Rao Art Gallery, Chitrangi Palace and Rallabandi Subbarao Museum. Rajamahendravaram is well connected by road with all major cities in Andhra Pradesh.

Rich history

Rajamahendravaram is a beautiful city located on the banks of the mighty Godavari river. Rajaraja Narendra, the Eastern Chalukya king built this city in 1022 AD. ‘Adikavi’ Nannaya, who belongs to this region, is held in high regard as the person who revived the Telugu language.","The old municipal corporation building, which was constructed during the British period, to be developed into a museum | ExpressRAJAMAHENDRAVARAM: Rajamahendravaram, cultural capital of the State, is known for its old traditions, culture and practices.

A Mythical Reality,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/mar/17/a-mythical-reality-1787726.html,"Saturday, March 17, 2018 01:16 PM +0530","Two towering mud walls made of packed earth between which runs a long and slim path are green with moss and exudes the smell of damp mud. They seemed to have miraculously risen up from hard earth like the Pandora from Avatar. Rising 70-80 feet, they dwarf people meandering at the far end of the path. The walkway itself abruptly ends at a massive courtyard, equivalent to several football fields, with a series of steps that lead to a huge bronze statue of the Hindu mythological bird, Garuda. This statue forms part of the main highlight of the Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park in the Badung area of Bali.

Spread over 60 hectares, the park, located on a limestone plateau, is higher than the rest of the surroundings. Developed as a major tourist attraction of Bali, the park’s theme is taken from Hindu mythology. At its centre stands Lord Vishnu upon his mount Garuda. Together they tower up into the sky, 120 metres high. The two statues are yet to be amalgamated, since they had been first established in two separate locations in the park.

The 18-metre high Garuda image is done in thick bronze sheet and set over an elaborate armature and scaffolding. It sits at one end of the area called the Lotus Pond, designed as an outdoor gathering space for large events, including a concert by heavy metal band Iron Maiden and pop band Paramore. The form looks dramatic from a distance and is intimidating at close quarters. Yet it has a serene feel. A little distance away from the Garuda statue stands the soaring form of Vishnu, rising up 75 metres.

Even before the two installations, the park had been quite popular with local visitors and tourists alike, boasting of various sights and activities. The entire space is crisscrossed by long narrow paths, holding secrets like a tranquil pond surrounded by lush landscaping and statues of mythological figures. A series of giant carvings in stone depicts characters from Hindu epics, especially from the Ramayana. Statues of Rama, Lakshmana, Ravana and other divine figures, done in Balinese style, line the corridors that lead to a small auditorium, where traditional kecak shows are held. A massive serpent done in black granite curves down the balustrade along long narrow flight of steps.

From time to time, a little enclosure near the Vishnu statue comes alive with the sounds of lilting music and staccato drum beats. They set the mood for the beautifully clad Balinese dancer, who arrives soon and enthralls the audience with her graceful movements, all the while holding an open paper fan in her delicate hands. As the tunes pick up tempo, her movements become vigorous and captivating.

Then suddenly the music stops after reaching the crescendo and an abrupt silence falls over the stage under the deep, calm gaze of Vishnu. The Lord seems satisfied with the peformance, as inscrutable his expression may be. While the evening shadows deepen through the coming twilight, the park and its environs turn into a surreal vista as the lines between myth and reality blur to present a haunting picture of alternative reality.

Factfile

The park is in Badung area.

How to reach: Many carriers offer flights from Indian metros to Bali’s capital Denpasar. The park is about 20 minutes’ drive from the airport, but you will have to hire a taxi since there is no public transport.","This statue forms part of the main highlight of the Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park in the Badung area of Bali.

York Art Gallery: Steeped in Heritage,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/mar/17/york-art-gallery-steeped-in-heritage-1788293.html,"Saturday, March 17, 2018 09:50 AM +0530","HYDERABAD: We continued our walk through York with Matthew Greenwood, our guide who took us along the historic York. In the 18th century the moneyed classes regarded York as an attractive and elegant alternative to London and today, the city’s lingering Georgian town houses and buildings are a precious reminder of its most elegant manifestation. There is so much to see and do in York: even their evening entertainment includes ghost walks through city’s shadowy snickelways and ginnels to find haunted pubs – of which York boasts a great many. But I chose to opt out of this adventure, as I am not too fond of ghosts.

York Art Gallery

This multi award-winning Art Gallery’s attractions include an impressive collection of paintings from 14th century to contemporary (including Picasso); Italian altarpieces, 17th century Dutch morality works; 19th century French artists; British paintings (from 16th century); a large collection of studio ceramics, Chinese and Korean pottery, glassware and other decorative objects.

I found a painting by Philip Mercier (1689-1760) – “A Scene from the Careless Husband” interesting and funny. I always like paintings that tell a story. In this scene from the popular 18th century play, his wife finds Sir Charles Easy in a compromising situation with a maid. However, instead of being angry, Lady Easy worries that her husband may catch a cold and gently covers his bare head. The loss of his wig was especially significant as it was considered shocking for a man to expose his naked, shaven head. I thought his exposed adultery is much more shameful and shocking!

JORVIK

One of the most popular visitor attractions in UK, the week-long JORVIK Viking Festival had just started that day: York wore a festive look, celebrating its rich Norse heritage. Inspired by the ancient Viking celebration of “Jolablot” - a Norse festival that heralded the end of winter hardships and the coming of spring, this thousand year old tradition was long forgotten until it was brought back to life in the 1980s. Matt said proudly that the festival’s fun-filled events, and battle re-enactments attract over 40,000 visitors from across the globe. We saw many people dressed up as Vikings: small children holding swords and posing for pictures; men dressed as pirates with fully set up shops; women in equally interesting Viking costumes, it was a journey back to the Viking era.

At JORVIK Viking Centre, during the ride, one can experience the recreated sights, sounds and smells, of the Viking-Age based on the excavations, as it stood in the 10th century York. It is said that over 15,000 objects were recovered in the process of uncovering a Viking village complete with workshops, rubbish pits, latrines and wells. The authentically recreated flora and fauna growing in the ground; the breeds of animals portrayed; the splashes of natural dyes found in one of the backyards; the ancient languages spoken from Old English, Norse and even Ancient Arabic, all depicted a true Viking village that York once was.

National Railway Museum

York’s first railway station was built in 1839, and the present magnificent edifice dates from 1877. When it was opened, it was the largest station of its type in Europe: the city was naturally an ideal setting for the National Railway Museum. The giant halls are full of steam and diesel engines alongside railway legends including Mallard, the world’s fastest steam locomotive. With over 200 years of history, and innumerable railway objects, the museum receives close to half a million visitors each year. The star attractions are Stephenson’s Rocket, Station Hall - home to queen Victoria’s favourite saloon and the world’s finest collection of royal carriages.

The Chocolate City

We had a lovely chocolate break - don’t we all know that York is famous for its chocolates? While other British cities were built on steel, coal or wool, York’s fame and fortune have rested on chocolate for almost 300 years and still remains UK’s home of chocolate. Nestle (formerly Rowntrees) and Terry’s chocolate factories grew up here - Kit Kat too was born here! We indulged in sinful chocolates of all kinds and bought some to carry home.

Minster

A massive, imposing statue of the Roman emperor Constantine greeted us at the entrance as we reached the world-famous York Minster. It is said that Constantine the Great was crowned in York in 306 AD, and is the only Roman emperor to have been crowned anywhere outside of Rome. York Minster is said to be the largest Gothic cathedral in Northern Europe.

Today it stands to dominate the city: with roots in the nation’s earliest history. The glorious structure is said to have taken 250 years to build, from 1220 until its consecration in 1472. A masterpiece in stained glass and stone, the great East Window is known to be the largest area of medieval stained glass in the world. It looked like an enormous canvas with innumerable colourful paintings, all illustrating different stories from the Bible.While we sat admiring the stunningly beautiful interiors, we could hear the choir rehearsing for the evensong. As the notes of the divine music filled the lofty space, I could sense an all-encompassing peace and heavenliness.

Samuel Abhishek, a student from the city almost died on a trek to Sar Pass in the Himalayas last year.

“I had no clue how steep the terrain would be. It was my first trek and my body was in no shape to take on the challenge,” Samuel recollected.

The five-day trek left Samuel with High Altitude Pulmonary Edema, a fatal disease which fills the lungs with fluid. He had to be carried out of the mountains by fellow trekkers. He was warned about such complications but only before setting of on the trek.

“I wouldn’t have registered if I had been told it would involve in such dangerous environment with possibilities of life threatening illnesses,” Samuel said in retrospect. The trek took a toll on his friends as well. “Regret set in in the first two days,” he said.

Tarun Rathi, co-founder, Plan The Unplanned, a trekking agency in Bengaluru, said it’s important for wanderlust-struck newbies to not bite more they can chew. He also emphasised the importance of getting to know the distance before even planning to register for a trek.

To last a day’s trek (12-15 km), a person must be able to at least run five kilometres at one go. “For bigger treks, involving a few nights in the open, higher fitness levels are required,” he said.

Tarun shared a checklist to follow before setting out on a trekking adventure.

Humans can last without food for a week but two days without water can kill you or leave you severely disoriented. Pack more water than required because you never know what you might need it for.

2) First-aid kit

They can buy injured trekkers time till they can get to a hospital. Carry an exhaustive kit to ensure even serious injuries can be addressed.

3) Local guide

In the recent forest fire tragedy in Theni, the local guide played a crucial role in saving lives. He guided a 13-member group to safety through an alternative route. Venturing into any environment without a local guide is dangerous.

4) Walking sticks, pads

Walking sticks go a long way during long treks. They offer support and balance while tackling steep terrain. For climbing knee pads also come in handy.","Samuel Abhishek, a student from the city almost died on a trek to Sar Pass in the Himalayas last year.
It was my first trek and my body was in no shape to take on the challenge,” Samuel recollected.
The five-day trek left Samuel with High Altitude Pulmonary Edema, a fatal disease which fills the lungs with fluid.
He had to be carried out of the mountains by fellow trekkers.
To last a day’s trek (12-15 km), a person must be able to at least run five kilometres at one go.","['setting', 'trek', 'samuel', 'calling', 'trekking', 'terrain', 'fit', 'trekkers', 'mountains', 'local', 'treks', 'days', 'water']",
Visit these cool destinations in South India to sober the searing summer,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/mar/10/visit-these-cool-destinations-in-south-india-to-sober-the-searing-summer-1784941.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 10:22 AM +0530","NEW DELHI: These places are strikingly beautiful even in summer and will give you the perfect break from heat and pollution in the city.

With its gorgeous slopes and poised ascents, its ethnographic attractions, its water bodies and so much more, Devikulam is no less than a calling for those who want to know why Kerala is called 'God's Own Country'.

Reliving the memoirs of Rangasthalam,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/mar/09/reliving-the-memoirs-of-rangasthalam-1784648.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 09:00 AM +0530","Visit Rangasthalam set and the first thing you notice is its aesthetic brilliance. Production designers and real-life partners Ramakrishna Sabbani and Mounika Nigottre Sabbani have recreated an artistic village of the 80s era comprising a government hospital, Gangalamma temple, panchayat office and houses with old potsherd roofs and mud replicating a beautiful village of Godavari in the city. The couple takes us back on their nostalgic trip in an exclusive interview

HYDERABAD: Born and brought up in Hyderabad, Ramakrishna Sabbani’s tryst with films started with Andala Rakshasi. After his second film Sahasam, he relocated to Mumbai and returned to Hyderabad for Kerintha and went onto allure the audience with his creativity in films like Subramanyam for Sale, Bhale Manchi Roju, etc.

So, what exactly is a production designer’s job? Ramakrishna shares, “Our work is to create a perfect ambience and the backdrop a story demands by using our imagination, colour without distracting the audience from the story and the characters.”

Sharing how they seized the opportunity, Ramakrishna and Mounika explain, “Impressed with our work in Jyo Achyutananda, Sukumar approached us for Nannaku Prematho. But we couldn’t grab the offer due to other commitments and finally collaborated for Rangasthalam. When Sukumar narrated the script, we realised that it will be an ambitious film in our career. We visualised the film, the texture, colour hues and design it should have in the discussion stages and planned everything accordingly. Besides production design, we have handled the art direction for Rangasthalam too.”

Interestingly, the duo didn’t take any references to build the set and everything was conceived from their own imagination. “Before arriving at what we thought would be appropriate for the film, we have sketched the village to make Rangasthalam possible. As 90 percent of the film has to be shot in the set, every day was a challenge for us. We had six assistants working closely with us. Given the budget and time constraints, we have delivered everything on time. As creative people, we have to constantly analyse our work and improvise the concepts, if needed. We ensured that there won’t be any room for mistakes with our meticulous planning. Also, Sukumar is sure of what he wanted and he was involved in every aspect. That made the things easy.”

Terming Rangasthalam a special film of their career, Ramakrishna and Mounika recall, “The film has an interesting, yet nostalgic design with props. The emphasis is always on realism. Since the film was set in the 80s, nothing from that era is available in the market. So, we have decided to create everything from the scratch. The rats, roofs, wooden gates, doors, cool drink trays, Frooti pack, Horlicks box, cool drink, trays were all the work of the production department. The village set cost `5 crore and 400 people worked for two months.”

The real challenge of craftsmanship came while marking. “The outdoor was a rocky terrain with only two trees. So, to come up with all the designs and placement of each thing in line without imagination was really difficult. We spent many days working on the modalities. We started the shoot when summer was at its peak and continued to work under different weather conditions. I must say, it was an enriching experience,” recalls Ramakrishna.

Mounika, who hails from Delhi, says there were no references to those years and it’s was tough to gather all the material at hand. “At times, Sukumar, Ram Charan and others were surprised to see the things on set which they have seen in their childhood,” reminisces Mounika.

So, from where did the duo obtained these things? she says, “We have procured some items that ruled our lives in the 80s from some antique shops in Rajahmundry. We also salvaged old building materials like windows, doors, vintage trunks, chests from the locals. We have got brass vessels, antique iron spatulas, bowls, jugs and other kitchen utensils in exchange for new ones from the villagers. We have used three trucks to transport all these things to Hyderabad.”

The BFA graduate from Hyderabad, Ramakrishna says it’s tough to shoot in a remote village. “We shot in a village near Polavaram and it was difficult to reach the location in the early morning and return to Rajahmundry in the nights. We travelled on boats carrying all the equipment and worked till late at night. There were no mobile signals and if we have to call someone, we have to place a call at the nearest post-office. We tried to hook an antenna for mobile signal but after some days, it was knocked off due to heavy wind. So, it was impossible for us to co-ordinate without phones. Imagine a 400 member team including Ram Charan, Samantha living without any facilities and external communication. With a lot of determination, we braved all the challenges and experienced the life of the 80s (smiles),” reveals Ramakrishna.

He adds, “Some villages we shot in were submerged due to Polavaram project. So, if one has to see the green cover of their villages, they should watch Rangasthalam.” Working on a film of this magnitude is not an easy job and at times, some differences may crop up between technicians. Ask Ramakrishna if there was an instance which required him to convince or persuade Sukumar? He explains, “There is no room for arguments or differences whatsoever. We had a plan and our only job is to make sure our director’s conviction comes true. Everything went on really smooth. I take this opportunity to thank Sukumar, our producers and other crew for supporting us in all endeavours.”

Most often, you meet amazing people along the way and make connections that last a lifetime.

It is time to let go the insecurities, dependency and take yourself to chase your freedom. Anybody can be an explored if they wanted to be one.

So, if you are ready to explore, Jayanth Sharma, co founder and CEO Toehold has a list of some must visit destinations in India, which are prominent for their beauty and are absolutely safe:

Ladakh

The crown of India is beautified by Ladakh, the land of high passes, situated in the picturesque state of Jammu and Kashmir. During summer, this beautiful region is adorned with a plethora of vibrant colors, but come winter time it is transformed into a snowy white wonderland, often cut off from the rest of the world.

Start your trip from the charming town of Leh, which will woo you with its quaint markets and charming palaces. Visit the beautiful Sham valley and the ancient monasteries of Lamayuru and Liker. Take a trip down to enchanting Nubra valley and visit the famous Deskit monastery and the Hall of Fame, to experience local culture at its best. Lose yourself in the hypnotizing of the beautiful Pangong Tso and enjoy a memorable sunrise and sunset by the lake. A thrilling camel safari and drive through the highest motor able road in the world, seems just too good to be true!

Kabini

Kabini is one of the most popular haunts for those who love to explore the wilderness and enjoy getting up close with nature. It has a lot to offer right from the Jungle Safari, boating to trekking in Nagarhole Forest. The nature walk in the forest is a must if you want to reconnect with the surroundings and nature all over again. The jungle safari is a wonderful opportunity for all the environmental enthusiasts to mingle among the variety of flora and fauna. Enjoy the royal feel of an elephant safari for the view is just spectacular with dense forest all around and at times spotting various animals in their natural surroundings makes the ride worth it. A trip to Kabani can introduce you to the world of misty forests, valleys and watercourse.

Andamans

Andaman is known for its beautiful flora and fauna, and its mesmerizing and breath-taking locations. Explore the phenomenal journey to exotic and beautiful islands of Andaman as they are a perfect place to ramble around or simply chill out on sun-toasted beaches. Butler Bay is Little Andaman’s best beach which has a spectacular curved beach with lifeguards and good surf.

Also Visit Radhanagar which is One of India’s prettiest and most famous stretches of sand Then there is Little Andaman lighthouse makes for a worthwhile excursion. For a Good swimming and snorkeling the white sand beach Lalaji Bay will be apt. Another Must vist places are Cellular Jail which is located at Port Blair, stood mute witness to the tortures meted out to the freedom fighters, who were incarcerated in this jail and the Anthropological Museum provides a throwback to the islands’ indigenous tribal communities. The glass display cases may be a tad old school, but they don’t feel anywhere near as ancient as the simple geometric patterns etched into a Jarawa chest guard, a skull left in a Sentinelese lean-to, or the totemic spirits represented by Nicobarese shamanic sculptures.

Ranthambore

Ranthambore National Park is one of the biggest and most renowned national park in Northern India. Being considered as one of the famous and former hunting grounds of the Maharajas of Jaipur, today the Ranthambore National Park terrain is major wildlife tourist attraction spot that has pulled the attention of many wildlife photographers and lovers in this destination.

Spotting a tiger in its natural habitat is one of the most captivating sights you can ever imagine at Ranthambore National park. Hiking up to the Ranthambore Fort as it offers brilliant views of the entire park. Unlike the rest of Rajasthan, Ranthambore offers unique handicrafts to take home.

She was delivering the keynote address at the inaugural session of the national seminar on ‘Narrating Travel, Mapping Identities’ at the Senate Chamber, University of Kerala, Palayam, on Monday.

“Travel writing needs to be factual, linear and objective,” she said to the students assembled for the event. Her talk ‘Travel writing in India and the West’ analysed the relation between India and the west in travel writing. She delved on the two streams of mountain travel writings of the 1930s - the scientific and the Christian mystical mountain travel writing - and explored its relation to narrative and identity.

The talk also laid due emphasis on refugee literature and analysed contemporary migrant and refugee works from Pakistan. ‘Exit West’ by Mohsin Hamid and ‘A Time of Madness: A Memoir of Partition’ by Salman Rashid were examined in the category. She said Rashid’s book was the ‘true’ travel book to her.“In lucid, unembellished prose, Rashid writes of a journey of places and people. It is much more powerful than fictional travel,” she said. Noting that travel writing should always have a real journey, she stressed the strength of travel writers is in their attention to facts.

Kerala State Higher Education Council vice-chairman Rajan Gurukkal, who gave the inaugural address stressed upon different techniques and forms of ‘narrative’ and traced its contribution in shaping society’s development over centuries.

The three-day seminar on travel writing organised by the Institute of English, University of Kerala, will have plenary sessions on travel writing by noted academicians and travel writers.

Straight out of a Danish dream,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/mar/03/straight-out-of-a-danish-dream-1780749.html,"Saturday, March 3, 2018 07:41 PM +0530","I haven’t stopped smiling since I landed in Aarhus. As I walk through the 150-metre circular walkway of the Rainbow Panorama—an installation by the artist Olafur Eliasson atop the ARoS Art Museum—it feels like moving through a kaleidoscope of myriad hues. Aarhus, the City of Smiles, has a new sobriquet. It is dubbed the European Capital for Culture.

The Grauballe Man who is preserved in the Moesgaard Museum in Aarhus is a macabre representation of primeval tragedy—a pre-historic corpse discovered in a peat bog, with his throat slit. There is magic to be encountered, too, while passing into another time by losing oneself in the fairy tale atmosphere of Den Gamle By—the Old Town of Aarhus. Seventy-five half-timbered buildings and houses brought and assembled here from over twenty 16th and 19th century Danish towns create an illusion of a “living town”.

The Jutland Peninsula of Denmark is surrounded by the North Sea, the Baltic, Skagerrak and the Kattegat, and is bordered by Germany on land. Old towns, ocean legends, fishing hamlets, pretty yellow houses, handsome seamen, museums and churches mix to form a smorgasbord of road trip.

Further ahead is a windswept charming little seaside town called Saeby. It is a sea of yellow houses, looking like miniatures in a Hans Christian Anderson dream. Amidst them stands a pristine white church, towering dramatically over the landscape. The façade of the 15th century building is austere but do not be misled: the interiors are colourful.

In Saeby, the sea casts a spell. Lulled into a deep slumber, the anchored yachts are huddled together while the shore looks like a picture postcard with an array of cafes and restaurants; some housed in charming monuments. Standing tall is the two-faced Lady of the Sea. Dotted with ceramic tablets crafted by children, the sculpture has been inspired by Norwegian writer, Ibsen, who had visited the quaint town. From there on, the road leads past the Frederikshavn port to Skagen.

The lusty winds, the wild sea, the dreamy yellow houses, the red cabins by the shores—Skagen is a dreamscape from a fantasy novel. No wonder, the town known for its “Skagen yellow” homes has attracted artists and writers, including Andersen.

At the Grenen, two oceans meet—the North Sea or Skaggerak and the Kattegat drained by the Baltic Sea and separated by a sliver of a sandbar. To stand with feet set in different oceans and watching the wild waves is like straddling the essence of different continents.

At Aalborg stands the monumental Utzon Centre designed by the architect John Utzon. But it is the Kildeparken, the musical park of Aalborg, that stirs with a unique ecosystem. In the winds that sweep the town, the trees planted there by musicians from all over the world sing their songs.

Fact File

Jutland is the mainland part of Denmark. It is a large peninsula connected to the European continent.

How to reach: Billund Airport is the main airport. It has direct connection with almost every major North European hub.","The Jutland Peninsula of Denmark is surrounded by the North Sea, the Baltic, Skagerrak and the Kattegat, and is bordered by Germany on land.

A day is full of possibilities in Israel",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/mar/01/history-culture-nature-a-day-is-full-of-possibilities-in-israel-1780618.html,"Thursday, March 1, 2018 03:00 PM +0530","TEL AVIV: How about visiting a beautiful beach along the Mediterranean Sea, walking on layers of history stretching back to over 2,000 years, and dropping in on one of the most diverse organic farms in the world? All in a day?

It is possible to pack one's day with vast possibilities in Israel, a country rich in culture and history -- and one that is geographically compact and yet has a varied topography. The excellent transport infrastructure also ensures easy and fast travel.

We started our day with a quick visit to the organic farm of Mizpe Hayamim, a hotel in northern Israel that can be a role-model for the farm-to-table concept. Spread over a vast area, the organic farm has flowers, vegetables, herbs, fruit trees, livestock and a dairy.

The farm provides fresh seasonal produce for the hotel's vegetarian restaurant and meets almost all its needs. Apart from boutique cheeses, liqueur, jams, unique blends of coffee, home-made pastries and sweets, even soaps are produced on the farm.

The farm is on a hillock and reflects the enterprise and determination that have turned the seemingly barren land into a fertile asset, attracting people from all parts of the world.

Mizpe Hayamim is close to the Sea of Galilee and views of the vast expanse around were amazing. The expansive views continued as we travelled to Zichron Ya'akov, a quaint town on Mount Carmel, founded in 1882 by 100 Jewish pioneers who returned to their Biblical homeland from Romania.

The main shopping street at Zichron Ya'akov is on a slight incline, making the walk a pleasure. It is lined with cafes, small shops and old buildings. After having a sumptuous lunch at a Baronita restaurant, located on a pedestrian street, we headed for the ancient port city of Caesarea, a fascinating place steeped in history that transports you back in time by centuries.

The Caesarea National Park has remains of many periods and the attractions include Roman theatre, hippodrome, sea-shore promenade, the crusader gate and the magnificent port.

The city, rebuilt by Herod the Great in 22-10 BCE, is a treasure trove for any student of history and archaeology. While we took a quick tour, an entire day can be spent here discovering its chequered past -- which also saw it emerge as a major port of trade between the Roman empire and Asia.

It did not take long to reach Tel Aviv from Caesarea and the city impressed with its neatness and vertical architecture. The modern, cosmopolitan city with several avenues of shopping and a thriving nightlife also has the highest number of high-tech companies per capita in the world. Located on the eastern Mediterranean coastline, Tel Aviv has captivating beaches.

We took Segways, the two-wheeled electric vehicle, to explore the beach promenade, and it was an unforgettable treat.

Moving along on the big wheels in gentle breeze, the Segway tour presented different views of the waves, the sea, the setting sun and the elegant shops on the beach side. It is not difficult to use Segway and all it requires is a bit of practice under watchful eye of an expert.

Tel Aviv can be the base to visit some other destinations in Israel, including Jerusalem and Haifa.

The coastal city of Haifa has a sense of tranquility about it and the Baha'i World Centre and Hanging Gardens -- a Unesco World Heritage Site -- immensely add to its quiet charm. There are quite a few places to explore nearby. We went to Derech Hatavlinim Herb and Spice Farm and it was a model for agri-tourism. The farm attracts about 150,000 people from all parts of the world annually. The farm, with a visitor centre in the fields, offers about 600 varieties of species and hundreds of varieties of blends and now has shops in different parts of the world.

Jeruslam, 66 km southeast of Tel Aviv, is a perennial attraction and our visit to Israel would have been incomplete without a look-in at its Old City. The Church of Holy Sepulchre, the Western Wall and the Dome of Rock are a few minutes walk from one another.

The Old City Train -- a cute little green and yellow road-train -- makes it easy and interesting to go through the Old City to the Western Wall.","It is possible to pack one's day with vast possibilities in Israel, a country rich in culture and history -- and one that is geographically compact and yet has a varied topography.

"Tips for picking, packing footwear for travel",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/feb/26/tips-for-picking-packing-footwear-for-travel-1779217.html,"Monday, February 26, 2018 04:43 PM +0530","NEW DELHI: Picking the right kind of footwear for your trip is important but what is more important is how to pack them. Wear your heavier shoes for the flight to lessen luggage weight, suggest experts.



Ishaan Sachdeva, Director at Alberto Torresi, Tabby Bhatia, Director at Voganow, and Harkirat Singh, MD at Woodland, have listed tips to make your travel lighter:



* Though slip-on shoes make everything faster at airport security, it is often recommended to wear your heaviest shoes when travelling. These account for half of luggage weight, so it's a big saver of space! It may take more time in the queue, but the sacrifice is well worth it for the saved weight and space.



* Try to find versatile shoes that will mix and match with all your outfits.



* Think outside the bag. Tie laces together and loop shoes onto the outside of your backpack, instead of packing them inside. Not only does this save room, but it lets smelly shoes breathe.



* When trying to figure out how to pack shoes for travel in a small bag, stuff smaller items and accessories into the shoes to utilise every available inch of packing space, and to prevent them from getting crushed.



If you're not stuffing, pack pairs of shoes tightly together, soles out, with the heels at opposite ends.



* Determine what activities you will do on your trip so you pack the appropriate footwear for the climate.



* Limit your colours to brown and black, as they go with anything. Besides, dark colours help hide scuffs and stains. If you pack a matching belt, you'll always be in practical style.



* Put the pair of shoes in a large plastic bag. Not only will this save you from digging through your luggage for a lost shoe but it will also help to keep your luggage odour-free.","NEW DELHI: Picking the right kind of footwear for your trip is important but what is more important is how to pack them.

Splendours of an era lost in time,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/feb/24/splendours-of-an-era-lost-in-time-1777486.html,"Saturday, February 24, 2018 08:00 PM +0530","Confined by the strict linearity of time, humans have constantly yearned to transcend its boundaries by reconstructing a picture of the bygone using evidence at our disposal. Lothal Burkhi is an inconspicuous station on the Ahmedabad-Bhavnagar railway line accessible by passenger trains running on an archaic narrow gauge. It takes merely two hours to cover a distance of around 96 km from the bustling city of Ahmedabad in 21st century to the forgotten town of Lothal that flourished in mid-third millennium BCE. Lothal is akin to a once valuable clock, a childhood artifact, gathering dust in the attic stuck in a time reminiscent of happy memories and unfulfilled dreams.

It has been nearly 4,000 years since boats sailed upstream from the Gulf of Khambat on the River Sabarmati and its tributary Bhogavo to Lothal in search for etched carnelian beads, seals and sealings, shell, ivory, copper and bronze objects that were in high demand in Western Asia. The boats took advantage of the high tide to reach this important trading town, unloaded their goods on a wharf adjacent to the dockyard, reloaded the goods earmarked for export and rode the waning tide to the Arabian Sea. The trade route navigated along the Gujarat coast halting at ports like Bet Dwarka before heading further west to Sindh, Baluchistan and Gulf of Oman ultimately entering the Persian Gulf. Today, it is perplexing to imagine this riverine character of Lothal as the ancient river has disappeared though the ruins of dockyard and an adjoining warehouse still exist. Built from kiln-fired bricks, the dock has two openings for passage of incoming and outgoing boats along with a stepped exit through which excess water was drained. The warehouse was raised on a mud-brick podium with a wooden superstructure. Sixty-five burnt clay seals typically associated with sites of the Saraswati-Indus Valley Civilization were found here along with a seal of the Persian Gulf style shedding light on the town’s probable trading partners.

Set against the backdrop of a vast countryside, it is the dockyard and foundation of the warehouse that greet a modern day visitor to Lothal. To North West of the warehouse is the Citadel or Acropolis elevated on a mud-brick platform that consisted of several large-sized houses, a well, and twelve bathing floors with accompanying drains that discharged into a larger drain. The Citadel must have had an impressive aerial view of the town spreading before itself with dockyard to the east, Lower Town to the north and a commercial sector to the north-west. The Lower Town had houses comprising a courtyard surrounded by rooms on three sides and fire altars were discovered in some of these dwellings. In the commercial area, the bead factory seems to have been a prominent enterprise and during excavation, a sizeable cache of beads made of carnelian, shell and steatite were discovered. Beads in different stages of production were strewn in the courtyard and eleven rooms surrounding it. Nearby a bronze drill bit was found that was used for boring the beads along with a fire kiln used for baking raw material and finished products.

Today, the erstwhile crowded markets of Lothal bear a deserted look. Decaying foundations are sole remnants of splendid structures that stood here aptly signifying the futility of human endeavours. The wells are dried up and the fire altars and kilns crave a touch of fire but warmth has long abandoned Lothal. The remains of a human presence in Lothal are graves in the cemetery west of the bead factory of which three had skeletons of two bodies placed side by side, a rare occurrence in the Harappan sites. But what do we know about the humans that inhabited this town? What were their aspirations, their festivals, their joys and fears?

When we come across the ornaments worn by women of Lothal or a terracotta bull and horse that might have been prized possessions of a child, we are overwhelmed by a strange tinge of sadness. When we behold a couple of vases painted with the story of a wise crow who dropped pebbles into a pitcher to drink water or a cunning fox who fooled a couple of birds holding a fish in their beaks to sing, we instantly appreciate the timelessness of these stories. And when we stumble upon terracotta gamesmen resembling the pieces on a chessboard, we realise that even though we shall all perish eventually, some of our memories will survive even the indifferent march of time.

Documenting a monument,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/feb/20/documenting-a-monument-1775828.html,"Tuesday, February 20, 2018 12:13 PM +0530","KOCHI: For Sreedevi Varma, it was her inquisitiveness, which led her to create the documentary ‘Chitharal’. The documentary, based on the ancient Jain monuments at Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, was released recently at Press club in the capital city.

According to Sreedevi, who has handled the script as well as the direction, the work is a detailed research on the history and origin of the place, taken mostly through interactions with researchers and scholars from the Archeological Survey of India. Sreedevi says, “We received permission from the Archeological Survey of India a few months back. Ten of us were associated with the work, and the shoot was completed in two days.”

A very ancient monument and religious spot associated with Jains in the south, it was the filmmaker’s inquisitiveness to know more, which drove her on the journey to make the film. The director, for whom visiting the relics was not a spontaneous idea says, “I had earlier written an article regarding how there is no concept of temples or idols for Jains. This section of people do not believe in worshipping even a flower. It was this article which generated curiousity in me to visit the place, which is believed to have the relics of an ancient Jain temple.”

Director Sreedevi Varma with crew members, Gireesh Paruthimatom and Hari Charutha

The director says that even if it is a story or article, she always had the habit of finding out more about the lifestyle, mannerisms and history of those associated. It was this habit which made her to do more research on this.While what remains of the Jain relics are mostly caves, going back to the eighth century, a Devi temple was later erected in the area by the then Travancore ruler, Sree Moolam Thirunal explains the filmmaker. It was the desire to let the public know more about Chitaral led her to work on it.

Winding up, she says, “There are many who don’t even know about the significance of the place, While Jainism and Buddhism is mostly associated with China and other Asian countries, the site became under the jurisdiction of the ASI. There are many other specialities to the place, one of which is being one of the few places in the south eastern coast to have a particular kind of rock formation which produces water when pressed or sucked on. The rocks also have red algae, which is also an uncommon phenomenon.”

The Chitharal Jain Monuments; also known as Chitharal Malai Kovil,Chitharal Cave Temple or Bhagwathi Temple, Chitral; is situated on the Thiruchanattu Malai (Thiruchanattu hillocks) near Chitharal village, Kanyakumari.

Living among the Japanese: An entrepreneur's tale,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/feb/19/living-among-the-japanese-an-entrepreneurs-tale-1775329.html,"Tuesday, February 20, 2018 12:11 PM +0530","KOCHI: Whenever the Tokyo-based Tiby Kuruvila introduced himself, the Japanese would say, “You Indians are so bright and intelligent.”One of the reasons for this attitude is that all the Indians in Japan are either in the IT industry, or working as engineers or scientists. “There is nobody from the worker class,” says Tiby. “They usually come from Philippines or Vietnam.”

Tiby Kuruvila with his family

The Japanese have a huge respect for India. “Since most Japanese are Buddhists, they revere India as the land of Lord Buddha,” he says. “They know about Mahatma Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose.”

The youngsters have a different attitude. “They feel India is growing so fast, at 7 per cent, compared to Japan’s 2 per cent, so they are thinking about how they can invest in India, and make money,” says Tiby.

But some misconceptions do exist. Since there are many North Indian restaurants in Tokyo, they feel that all Indians eat naan every day. “For them the curry we have is either vegetable or chicken,” says Tiby. “They are surprised to know that we eat with our hand. After watching movies, they feel that there are a lot of animals on the streets.”

Tiby, who is originally from Kothamangalam, has been living in Japan for the past 19 years. He is the CEO of a company called Pinmicro, which provides indoor GPS platforms. His partners are two Malayalees, Jayaraj T G and Gijo Sivan. They provide digital solutions to improve efficiency in the workplace, be it offices, factories, warehouses or hospitals.

He gives an example. “In a confectionery factory, the management wanted to ensure that every employee who enters the factory should have an air shower (this is usually done at entrances to remove particles on the clothes), followed by a hand-wash with alcohol to get rid of germs,” says Tiby. The company had placed cameras all over the factory. But then they realised that nobody can look at the cameras all the time. But through Tiby’s GPS platform, if a person forgets to do a hand wash, an alert is immediately initiated. “Hence, he or she cannot enter the factory premises,” says Tiby. “This will ensure employees who enter the work place are always clean.”Asked whether this constituted an invasion of privacy, Tiby says, “We are not recording anything.”

Meanwhile, when asked the advantages of working in Japan, Tiby says, “The technology is at an advanced stage. The transportation is very efficient. It is a clean and safe country.”And the people have a social attitude. During the devastating earthquake which hit Tokyo in 2011, there was a water shortage. The government instructed that everybody would receive two bottles of drinking water every day. “They would only take the amount specified by the government and not more,” he says. “When there were widespread power shutdowns, there were no reports on any thefts in the numerous shopping areas, which would have happened in other countries. The Japanese are a very self-disciplined people.”

But there are negatives too. “It is difficult to work in Japan since people only speak Japanese,” says Tiby. “It took me a few years to learn the language.”

The business model is still the old industrial style. “So everybody follows what the boss says,” says Tiby. “But that time is over. You have to work fast, make decisions quickly, and be innovative.”

And Tiby can notice the ‘falling behind’ effect when he goes to the malls. Ten years ago, when he went to buy a mobile phone, there were Japanese products from Sharp, Casio and Fujitsu. “Now, it is only Samsung and Apple, and a few Japanese brands,” he says. “Many American, Korean and Chinese companies have gone past the Japanese.”

Another problem for the Japanese is the declining birth rates. “The number of children per couple in Japan is very low,” says Tiby. “A small work force will have to feed a lot of elderly people. This will become critical in the next five years. So, the government is doing a lot to attract Indian talent to Japan. There are a lot of Indo-Japanese events taking place in India as well as Japan.”

However, Tiby says that even though they live in Japan, the Malayalis are preserving their culture. “For Onam, last year, 500 people gathered and we had sadya and other celebrations,” says Tiby who is married to Nigi and has two children, son, Johaan, nine-and-a-half and daughter Jewel, 7. Asked his future plans, Tiby says, “I plan to work for the next ten years in Japan till my children reach university. Then I will return to Kerala and help young people who have plans to set up start-ups.”","“They usually come from Philippines or Vietnam.”Tiby Kuruvila with his familyThe Japanese have a huge respect for India.

A stroll through the artworks of historic Holland- The New Indian Express,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/feb/16/a-stroll-through-the-artworks-of-historic-holland-1774441.html,"Saturday, February 17, 2018 12:14 PM +0530","HYDERABAD: Holland greeted me with a stormy weather but compensated with hot chocolate (with lots of cream on the top!!) and stroopwafels. Well, both the weather and the irresistible food are typically Dutch. While in Holland, one has to take the weather with a handful of salt and grab the goodies with both the hands.

In a scenic drive of fewer than 30 minutes from the Amsterdam airport, we reached a beautiful Country Estate – ‘Landgoed Duin & Kruidberg’ (try pronouncing it!).

This lovely property ensconced in the woods has turned from the once princely hunting grounds to five- star hotel, restaurant and convention centre all rolled into one: it has an interesting history and many exciting tales to tell. The fairy tale Old-Dutch style monument takes one back to the 17th century when many Amsterdam traders boasted rural estates like this. Its oldest known owner Hendrik Reijnst was with Dutch East India Company.

The estate changed many landlords from governors to ministers to politicians; it became a hunting lodge; underwent changes from baroque to typically British. What impressed me most was its priceless art filling every corner. Its four beautiful period rooms were my favourite haunts as I would walk through them or recline in a seat and sink in the old world charm. My room had a pretty view of the pond where ducks were swimming the whole day. On the way to the Brasserie in the basement, I would often stop at the statue of Moses and give him an admiring look, silently appreciating the sculptor.

My introduction to Dutch cuisine happened rather interestingly. In their Michelin starred restaurant De Vrienden van Jacob, the chef sent me a starter that tasted like our much loved “masala vada”, one of the many gems from the South Indian “evening tiffin” repertoire. When I enquired after its history, the young, enthusiastic waiter went to the chef and came back with the recipe: it is made of buckwheat and powdered macadamia nuts, deep-fried to a golden brown.

Then came a “sago papad” like fritter, which reminded me of home, of the heavenly rasam, hot rice, melted ghee and potato chips: the waiter went to and fro again to get me the info – it is made of the stuff used for the outer cover of spring roll. That’s all, I didn’t bother him anymore, though he looked at me questioningly after serving each course – I relaxed and enjoyed my first Dutch meal that ended with the most delicious and sinful chocolate-caramelised banana combo with peanut butter. I threw caution to the squally winds outside and indulged without an iota of guilt.

That afternoon, as a storm raged with the gustiest winds, we set out to visit Zaanse Schans (another tongue twister?), which is a unique mill village that brings together many important elements of Dutch heritage from the Zaan district. Numerous mills and historic houses have been collected here and restored to their former glory. Along with the Old Dutch crafts like clog making, cheese making, and pewter casting, it provides a good impression of Netherlands’ rich history. We had a memorable tour of this place: more memorable because of the weather. Fighting against a cruel gale, holding my upturned umbrella with all my might, I saved myself from being blown away by the strong winds!

As we strolled past, clutching the flying umbrellas of course, the 18th and 19th centuries were brought to life and the smell of fresh bread wafted across. Entering the 17th-century cheese farm “Catharina Hoeve” was like stepping back in time. Dressed in the traditional Dutch costume, a charming lady demonstrated how the world famous “Gouda” cheese is produced in accordance with a very Old Dutch recipe. We tasted different types of cheese after gaining considerable knowledge on the subject of Dutch cheese. The farm shop was set in a charming ambience – I bought lots of cheese and some souvenirs to take back home.

The De Vrede warehouse from the 18th century now houses a clog maker’s shop and clog museum. In a fun-filled demonstration, the handsome young man with a winning smile showed old clog making craft that magically transformed a plain block of wood into a lovely wooden shoe. The accompanying clog museum houses the finest collection of antique clogs in the Netherlands, accumulated over the years, including many unusual specimens, like authentic carved bride clogs, work clogs, and the famous Hindelooper church clogs from 1675.

To take back home, I bought many pairs of tiny and very pretty clogs made of porcelain and wood: quite different from the usual fridge magnets which either end up fighting for space on an overcrowded fridge door or sit wrapped and unnoticed in the kitchen shelves.

In this Dutch location, there were several working windmills producing paint, oil, wood and mustard, attractive little shopping streets lined with authentic, green painted wooden houses. This is certainly Holland at its best!!

She was all of 25 when she started her own venture, an event management company. An engineering graduate, who went on to pursue media and communication, Ambika always knew that she was made for something more creative than doing data entry on the system.

“I started with my husband’s birthday, I organised it and put up the pictures on social media and the next thing I know I started getting more such events,” she says. Believing in the concept that no two events can be the same, if you infuse into it a personal story, Ambika has been successfully organising creative and quirky events in Chennai, Bengaluru, Goa, Udaipur and also in Bangkok. In a tête-a-tête, the young entrepreneur talks about her love for travel, bucket lists and getting over her fears. You mentioned that you were actively involved in college culturals. Is there a particular event that you were fond of?

I love singing. In fact that is how my husband and I met. We used to be a part of the college band. Music is what drives me. I enjoy all genres but I prefer soulful music with lyrics. I am not a big EDM fan, but I love rock, metal and Hindi music, especially songs of Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Atif Aslam, Arijit Singh, etc.



You recently went on your first solo trip. Do you trvael a lot?

Travelling is one of my biggest passions. When I close my eyes I want to see myself smiling and someone who has seen the world. I work hard every day because I had to have enough money in my wallet to be able to travel. My first solo trip was to Shillong (November 2017), I went to see the Cherry Blossom festival. There were many who raised their eyebrows and said ‘oh, travelling solo?’, but I didn’t care. I thought it changed me for the better.



You also have a bucket list of things you want to do. Have you ticked off anything?

I am an adventure sports lover. I have ticked so many things off my list like sky diving. This year when I did my solo trip, for a person who is claustrophobic and also doesn’t know swimming — I love challenging myself, I booked this place at the border of Shillong and Bangladesh and did my first scuba diving there. This time I went to Gili islands and did my third dive there in the ocean, it was so beautiful. And I think life is more beautiful under water.



What is the best thing about travelling?

I love meeting new people. Each individual has a lot to teach you. When you go to different places, you meet new people and when you listen to their problems and stories, all your problems and stress begin to seem like nothing. I think if I don’t put my daughter in college, I would just give her money to backpack and see the world, because it can teach you so much, that books probably can’t.



Are you a foodie? Do you also cook?

There was a time when I used to eat to live, but now I live to eat. That changed because of my best friend, who is in the hotel industry, and she made me eat some really good food. Travelling, eating good food and discovering culture goes together. I love trying new places. I am a huge fan of Asian cuisine; nothing beats it. I am a very moody cook; I don’t go into the kitchen every day. But, I have been told that when I cook, I cook well.



Do you have any hobbies?

I did not know this until last year, but I love gardening. I have seen my mother gardening but never knew I would have a thing for it. So now my office has many plants, mostly low maintenance ones that I procured from different places. It is so therapeutic to wake up in the morning to water them and just see them grow.","CHENNAI: The A-Cube Project was the result of one restless night in bed, where I thought to myself what I was doing in life,” exclaims Ambika Ankit Agarwal.

They arrived in Kerala as traders around 10 centuries ago and have made rich contributions to our culture. The Jew Street at Broadway, the Ernakulam Market developed by them and the seven synagogues - all hold testimony to the Jewish influence in Kerala history. With the community migrating to Israel, their promised land, the heritage lie in tatters.

Dwindling population and neglected synagogues reflect the predicament they face. After the formation of Israel in 1948, members of the community started migrating to their Holy Land and only a few, around 30 to be precise, remain in Kerala. The Jew Town at Mattancherry, which is famous for the Paradesi Synagogue, has got just five Jews - four women and one man and three of them are above 80 years of age.

“There are only less than 30 Jews here in Kochi. But we want our heritage to be protected. Recently, we decided to renovate the Thekkumbhagom Synagogue located at Broadway and begin prayer service. My family used to attend prayers at this synagogue. We have decided to celebrate Pesaha (Passover) in April this year and around 50 members of the Kerala Jewish community are expected to arrive from Israel to attend the celebration. We have a Rabbi (priest) called Aviv Mizrahi, who will conduct the prayers. My son Anil Abraham is making the arrangements for the group,” said Josephai Abraham, known as Sam, the president of the Association of Kerala Jews.

It is said the 16th century Torah Ark, Bima (pulpit) and other inside furnishings of the Thekkumbhagom synagogue were taken to Israel in 1970s and incorporated to the Moshav Nevatim’s Synagogue.



The seven exquisite synagogues in Kerala - Paradesi and Kadavumbhagam in Mattancherry, the Thekkumbhagom and Kadavumbhagam synagogues at Ernakulam Market, and the three at Paravur, Chendamangalam and Mala are gradually disintegrating due to neglect. The Association of Kerala Jews is striving to conserve the buildings and is planning to approach the Union Government seeking steps to protect them as heritage structures.

“As every other Jew, I want to migrate to Israel, the Holy Land. It’s God’s will and we have to abide by it. But I want to ensure the synagogue is protected before I leave,” said Elias Josephai, the caretaker of Kadavumbhagam synagogue at Broadway. No sabbath was conducted at the synagogue after 1972 and Elias wanted to revive the prayers. According to halakha, the Jewish religious law, the sabbath is observed from the sunset on Friday evening till the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night. “But there are only three people in Kochi who know to read the Torah. We conduct prayers only when some visitors come from Israel,” he said. There are no Rabbis and it is the male elders of the community who lead the prayers.

“It is a fact the Jewish diaspora is vanishing from Kerala society. But you cannot ignore our contributions to the state’s culture and development. When the Jews arrived here, Kochi was a marshy land and we developed it as a trade centre. We brought business here. Because of our efforts the city flourished and this fact should be recognised. The Ernakulam Market was under the control of the Jewish community till 1935 and we handed over the rights to the Kochi Municipality in 1935. The government should protect the synagogues as heritage structures. Though the Jewish cemetery near St Teresa’s College is a protected monument, its has turned into a dump yard. The cemetery at Mala is being razed and converted into a stadium. We may not live here for ever, but these structures are remnants of the past and they should remain,” said Elias.

Paradesi Synagogue

Queenie Hallegua, the oldest member of the Paradesi community in Mattancherry declined to comment on the demand of protection of synagogues. “I don’t want to draw the synagogues into a controversy. The members of the community will decide on protecting them,” she said.Two years ago the 1,000-year-old synagogue at Mala was vandalised by miscreants. It is said around 40 Jewish families lived in Mala till 1955. Once the community migrated to Israel, the property was handed over to Mala panchayat. Mala Paitruka Samrakshana Samithi has been striving to conserve the synagogue as a monument.

The Jews from Kochi had made a representation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Israel last year demanding steps to preserve their heritage including the seven synagogues in Kerala. The 8,000-strong community of Kochi Jews in Israel has been discussing steps to conserve their heritage in Kerala. The community has made representations to the Kerala government seeking steps to conserve the synagogues.

Bengaluru's Malleswaram: Where live gods and their noble soldiers,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/feb/15/bengalurus-malleswaram-where-live-gods-and-their-noble-soldiers-1773456.html,"Thursday, February 15, 2018 08:04 AM +0530","BENGALURU: Malleswaram is a hub of citizen activism, with protests organised against varied ill-advised government actions – be it tree-felling or converting a playground into residential layout. Interestingly, residents here have never taken things lying down, even a century ago. At a walk, conducted by Sahapedia Walks & Talks, the guide Sujatha Balakrishnan said that Malleswaram residents had raised hell for the British in 1890s for not providing them with proper sanitation facilities. This locality was later developed by the Raj when plague struck Bengaluru.

Sujatha said that residents here demanded that they be provided basic needs of potable water and hygienic surroundings. She said, “It is also said that they left corpses at doors of the officials as a sign of protest. The British were concerned that the disease could spread to the British-occupied areas too.” After relentless pressure from locals, the British officials developed this area as a modern example of a hygienic suburb.

The walk, which started at Sri Kaadu Malleswara Temple built in 17th Century, continued to Sri Dakshinamukha Nandi Tirtha Kalyani Kshetra, Malleswaram market, Sri Venugopala Krishnaswamy Temple, Government Girls School, CTR and K C General Hospital. Twenty five people, from teenagers to 40-year-olds, walked through this more-than-a-century-old locality.

Sujatha, who has been teaching history for 30 years, said that story-telling format always makes classes interesting. A theatre artist, she also uses the art form to teach lessons and takes students on field trips. A teacher Uma Panicker Sarath, who was at the walk, agreed that story-telling and seeing a place helps you feel more connected with the subject. This was her first heritage walk apart from the field trips from her school. “I had heard stories about Malleswaram from my librarian. She lives here. But seeing these places is a completely different experience,” she said.

Most residents in this locality are unaware of its heritage structures, said Archana Magundi and Ashritha Shri. Ashritha, a BSc student who lives in Malleswaram, said, “I have known this places but didn’t know about its history. The walk helped me understand my neighbourhood better.”Archana, who had studied in a government girl’s school in Malleswaram, said, “I did not know that my college building was once a private palatial bungalow of Nanjundaiah,first vice-chancellor of Mysore University.”

Participants also said that such walks help them see how locality has changed. Uma, said, “You can see small old buildings placed between huge commercial establishments. You train your eye to see a mix of old and new things here now,” said Uma.The walk ended with a filling breakfast at New Krishna Bhavan. The owner Gopinath spoke about how his restaurant manages to run ‘zero waste’.

Kadu Malleshwara Temple, 15th Cross

Shiva, as Mallikarjun, is the main deity in this temple on 15th Cross, Malleswaram. The temple is also known as Mallikarjun Swamy Temple. This locality, which was earlier known as Mallapuram, was named after this temple in the late nineteenth century. Venkaji Rao, step brother of Shivaji, is credited with building this temple. There is an inscription on the rock that reads whoever tries to destroy or harm the place will be reborn as crows and donkeys. If it is done by a Hindu, it would be considered equivalent to eating a cow in Kashi and if it is damaged by a Muslim, it would be equivalent to eating pork.

Villa Pottipati,4th Main Road

The building was built in 1865. Wilson, the caretaker, said, “Malleswaram was a forest area and there were very few houses back then. When the plaque hit the city, the British officials were asked to shift to this neighbourhood.” The house was bought by a businessman from Andhra Pradesh Ramalinga Reddy in 1925. The place was then leased out by the third generation of the family to Neemrana Hotels.

Venugopala Krishnaswamy Temple, 11th Cross

Originally, Nambi Narayana Swamy was planned as a main deity at the 115-year-old temple but, during the course of the construction, it was changed to Venugopalaswamy (infant Krishna). It is said that God appeared in Dewan Venkataranga Iyengar’s dream and asked to install deity of Venugopalaswamy. The deity were donated by Mysore Maharaja. The royal family donated a sum of 3,750 varahas (the then currency) and the local residents contributed 1,1794 varahas for the construction of the temple. It is also believed that couples’ prayers to have a child also comes true if they tie a small swing to onto temple’s ancient beams.

CTR, 7th Cross Road, Margosa Road

The Central Tiffin Room was started by Y V Subramanyam and brothers in 1920s. “It is said that they did not want the staff to be overburdened with work and hence, the family and friends of the owners would help serve at the restaurant,” said Sujatha. It was later established as Shree Sagar.

Government Girls High School, 13th Cross

The building was earlier a private palatial bungalow that belonged to H V Nanjundaiah, the first vice chancellor of Mysore University. He donated the building to the cause of girl’s education. Sujatha said, “I think Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV was the best. During his tenure, lot of educational institutions and industries came up. It was the golden period of the state.”

K C General Hospital, Malleswaram Circle

One of the city’s oldest hospitals, this government-run multi-speciality hospital located at Malleswaram Circle is said to be named after Mysore princess Kempu Cheluvarajamanni. Sujatha said, “A hospital was necessary as the city was hit with plaque.”

Malleswaram Market, Sampige Road

Sujatha said, “This was the BBMP land and around 50 years ago. This was given to about 200 shopkeepers. It was leased out to them at `150.” A few years ago, the BBMP said they want to bring down the building as it is dilapidated and gave it to BDA to develop a shopping complex. The shopkeepers who made appeals to the High Court were given makeshift shelters to do their business. “When I interviewed a vendor, she said her livelihood is doomed. The authorities promised them a floor in the complex but how can they afford the rent?,” she asked.","At a walk, conducted by Sahapedia Walks & Talks, the guide Sujatha Balakrishnan said that Malleswaram residents had raised hell for the British in 1890s for not providing them with proper sanitation facilities.

The event is modelled on inclusion, and will witness persons with disability participating with bikers in rock-climbing and scuba diving at Waves Swim Academy, Pallavaram, on Feb 17.

Persons with disability from Adventures Beyond Barriers Foundation (ABBF), who have been active in adventure sports like wrappling, para-gliding, and rock climbing will participate. Speaking to us about this initiative, Rana Pahwa, head of marketing at Firefox Bikes, said, “Our re-branding objective is to include ‘adventure’ in everyone’s vocabulary. We want to break the myth that persons with disability can’t be in sports. They’re the largest minority in India, and inclusion must start with them.”

This is the sixth edition of the event. Since August 2017, the previous editions in Pune, Mumbai, Gurgaon, Bangalore and Hyderabad, saw wrappling, rock climbing, and para-motoring activities for persons with disabilities. “For this edition, we have partnered with ABBF, who professionally train persons with disability in adventure sports. Divyanshu Ganatra who heads ABBF is visually impaired and is into para-gliding himself,” says Rana.

This edition will host 35 persons with disability and 40 Firefox bikers, apart from on the spot registrations. A brief will be given to all participants three hours before the event. Rana says, “If able-bodied persons like you and I can come and not just talk, but play a sport with persons with disability, only then we’ve achieved something.”

In an attempt to take this initiative of inclusion a step further, Firefox is planning to employ persons with disability across the country. Rana says, “We will start looking at profiles by next quarter. We will start by employing them as store managers in Chennai.”","CHENNAI: When Firefox Bikes, a brand of imported cycles in India, decided to remodel itself as a brand that brings adventure to everyone, it came up with #EverydayAbility.

The most beautiful courtyard Sundari Chowk in Nepal is restored and now open to public,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/feb/13/the-most-beautiful-courtyard-sundari-chowk-in-nepal-is-restored-and-now-open-to-public-1772639.html,"Tuesday, February 13, 2018 10:10 AM +0530","KATHMANDU: While the reconstruction of various heritage sites around the Kathmandu Valley remain mired in controversy, the ten-year-long restoration of the Sundari Chowk, an example of the grace and ambition of Newar Architecture, is now complete and open to the public, a report in The Kathmandu Post has said.

It is almost three years now that the devastating earthquakes hit Nepal, ravaging and terrifying the people and the landscape. Rebuilding has been slow, the government lagging, the head of the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) has changed multiple times due to political wrangling, and most people seem apathetic of the government’s will to really help its people.

Amid this morass, it is worth mentioning that the Patan Durbar Square and its adjoining palace complex is busily being repaired with dozens of people at work every day on 12 ongoing restoration projects—repairing and rebuilding the monuments and artefacts damaged by the earthquakes.

The multi-crore-rupee Patan Durbar Earthquake Response Campaign (2015-2021) launched just a day after the quake by the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust (KVPT) aims to restore the entire square and the Patan Palace by the year 2021, contingent on available funding. Today, walking across the square, instead of rubble, there is labelled scaffolding, describing the institutions or individuals who have generously given to the 26-year-old Trust.

While the furore over who should rebuild the iconic and beloved Kasthamandap (our Valley’s namesake situated in a still devastated Kathmandu Durbar Square) continues, the KVPT quietly rebuilds: One of its first major accomplishments was to repair and restore the fallen and squashed copper repoussé statue of King Yognarendra Malla to its place on the pillar looking east towards the three-storey Degutale temple.

While work continues around the square and the palace complex, the KVPT’s ten-year-long restoration of the Sundari Chowk (2006-2016), long considered the most beautiful courtyard in the Valley and an example of the grace and ambition of Newar Architecture at its best, is now complete and open to Nepali nationals for an entrance fee of Rs 30 which covers a visit to the Patan Museum’s Keshab Narayan Chowk, the Mul Chowk (or main courtyard), and the now complete inner-most Sundari Chowk, accessed via the Mul Chowk or circuitously through the gardens that are home to the also restored Bhandarkhal tank and its intricate stone pavilion.

The travails of fund-raising and gathering expertise for the restoration of this storied courtyard are recorded in a beautiful, scholarly book published by the KVPT as documentation for future restoration efforts—but for those who are not necessarily engrossed in the essentials of architectural history and are just enamoured by magnificent edifices, an unparalled use of space and light, a window into an exemplary of Newar architecture, the artistic traditions encapsulated within it, and a unique, innovative example of converting a palace into a museum, the beautiful courtyard is waiting to be visited.

The adaptive re-use of the 17th Century (thought to have been first built in 1627 CE) southern most addition to the Patan Durbar made by King Siddhinarsingh Malla, now includes within its restored walls an architecture gallery that houses a permanent exhibition illuminating the tradition of Newar Architecture. For those who may want to see how the Sundari Chowk itself may have been conceived and constructed, along with galleries with mud-floors and exposed wall paintings have been left untouched by the restorers so that the public may experience the feeling of bare feet on finely laid mud, an aspect that has now been taken over by brick tiling in an emulation of tradition that is not strictly accurate but more practical: The mud floors in the Sundari Chowk must only be stepped on without shoes and the galleries are closed weekly for maintenance in order to keep these fragile floors intact.

Today the Sundari Chowk is an emblem of a decades-long dream to establish architectural galleries within it—celebrating the arts that house them. The permanent collection in the grey painted Architecture Gallery, curated by Niels Gutschow, holds works of drawings and carefully recreated architectural edifices that seek to elaborate how former generations set about creating components of palace spaces such as the Sundari Chowk. As the Patan Museum, a former part of the palace restored by Götz Hagmüller, contains modern elements re-imagined to further enhance a contemporarily curated collection, so does this newly opened architectural gallery create fresh opportunities for larger pieces that can hang in spaces that would never have been used otherwise.

The North, South, and West Wings of the Sundari Chowk had been completed by the time the earthquake struck in April, 2015; they remained intact due to the structural fortification during the restoration (construction began in 2009, the former two years were devoted to fund-raising), holding despite the violent tremors. The as-yet unrestored East Wing collapsed, and it is this wing that was reconstructed with loving detail in keeping with the fortuitous documentation that had preceded its collapse. The East Wing now houses the double storey Architectural Gallery that is an example of adaptive re-use, creating a venue hitherto unseen before, similar in intention to the glass pyramid juxtaposed in front of the former palace that houses the collection of the Louvre; a choice now widely admired even while its detractors would have had it removed.

The Sundari Chowk is now available for big, ambitious exhibitions that the previously dark palace interiors could not have housed, in keeping with its analogue in the galleries of the Patan Museum which hold an open-air staircase that is bracketed by the glorious struts of the Bhai Degah Temple that may never have been seen at eye level in an older, lower ceilinged gallery structure. The restoration of the Sundari Chowk has accounted for and followed in the tradition that allowed its own organic adaptive evolution from palace complex, destroyed multiple times over the past four centuries, to the prison and Malpot office that it once housed before its restoration as an annex to the Patan Museum.

If you have missed this painstaking, thoughtful, exquisitely documented restoration, that followed the stringent rules of the government run Department of Archaeology, it is now time to go and see it for an experience of what can be accomplished given the will, the vision, the discipline, and of course the funding.","KATHMANDU: While the reconstruction of various heritage sites around the Kathmandu Valley remain mired in controversy, the ten-year-long restoration of the Sundari Chowk, an example of the grace and ambition of Newar Architecture, is now complete and open to the public, a report in The Kathmandu Post has said.

Rare images of Cochin Port Trust's early days handed over to Heritage Museum,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/feb/13/rare-images-of-cochin-port-trusts-early-days-handed-over-to-heritage-museum-1772421.html,"Tuesday, February 13, 2018 08:04 AM +0530","KOCHI: The Cochin Port Maritime Heritage Museum has got richer with a collection of 25 rare images dating back to the days of yore. The archival pictures depicting the construction of the port, especially the construction of the rail-road bridges to Willingdon Island, were handed over to the Museum on Monday.

R Shivshankar, son of R T Ramachandra aka RTR - the Resident Engineer in charge of bridge works for Cochin Harbour during 1936-40 - handed over the photographs and some old writings on the making of the Port to A V Ramana, Cochin Port Trust (CPT) deputy chairman at a function held at the museum.

Shivshankar recalled his father was the only Indian Engineer in the team of Sir Bristow who entrusted Ramachandra with executive charge of the bridges in Cochin. It was an engineering feat since underwater concrete pillars were erected on this scale for the first time in South India.He fondly reminisced Sir Bristow's farewell speech in which he showered encomiums on Ramachandra, calling him a person of exemplary conduct and an exceptional combination of theoretical and practical abilities.

coalesced into the CPT of today

Ramana recollected the contributions made by Ramachandra in providing the much needed rail-road connectivity to Willingdon Island as the Resident Engineer in the team of Sir Robert Bristow, the legendary British harbour engineer regarded as the architect of the modern port of Cochin. Of these, the Venduruthy Rail-Road Bridge and Mattanchery (old) bridge remain engineering marvels even to this day.

Ramachandra was a great philanthropic, who used to set apart a portion of his income to educate the children in his village. He was like a lighted candle which has the ability to spread light to many more candles. Ramachandra lit the candle of knowledge in several children in a rare act of benevolence. Goutam Gupta, Traffic Manager, Cochin Port Trust and C Premakumari, Secretary also spoke on the occasion.

Small-town kid made big

Ramachandra was born in Rudrapatna, a small village in Mysore, Karnataka in 1902 and graduated in Civil Engineering from the then Bangalore in 1923. He worked with the Bombay PWD, B.B & C.I. Rly, Callender’s Cable & Construction Co. Ltd, Braithewaite & Co. Engineers Ltd during 1923- 1936. After a four- year stint with the Cochin Port, RTR worked with the Inspection Wing of the Directorate General of Industry and Supply, Government of India. He passed away in 1962. RTR and Seethamma had six children and his son Shivshankar is now settled in the US.

Showcasing maritime history

The Maritime Heritage Museum situated at the North End of Willingdon Island depicts the maritime heritage of Cochin and evolution of the Cochin Port. It has on display rare photographs and old maritime equipment connected with the construction of Cochin Port. The images include arrival of the first train to Willingdon Island, loading of elephant gifted by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to the children of Russia, Mattanchery shore lined up with boats from Alleppey and construction of bridges and wharves. Models of mariner’s clock, mechanical calculator, underwater searching tool, steering unit etc are also on display.","KOCHI: The Cochin Port Maritime Heritage Museum has got richer with a collection of 25 rare images dating back to the days of yore.

Travel goals: How to fit exercise in your vacations,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/feb/12/travel-goals-how-to-fit-exercise-in-your-vacations-1772120.html,"Monday, February 12, 2018 11:29 AM +0530","LONDON: With the emerging trend of fitness fads, there is absolutely no reason to leave your fitness goals behind, even when you are travelling.

A good workout on the go can always be accommodated in your travel schedule, whether for business or pleasure.

As quoted by The New York Times, Annette Lang, a certified personal trainer said, “You can actually maintain and even improve your fitness level when you’re on the road. And, you don’t have to bother with a gym to do it”.

Lang shared some of her tips for fitting in some exercise while you travel:

- Feel and experience the new environment through activities:

You can include some physical activity each day of your getaway. Lang suggested renting a bike if you are in an urban location and ride along some scenic locations.

Take the stairs, hike along a local group, throw in a little exercise, or explore a local park – all these activities should do the trick.

- Create your own walking tour:

Nothing beats the experience of discovering a new locale on foot. It is the ideal way to get an authentic sense of place and include some physical activity while doing so.

Lang suggested making a list of destinations and set out on foot to explore them on foot.

- Go healthy with a mini breakie workout:

A short burst of high-intensity workout followed by a healthy breakfast is the perfect start of your day on a vacation.

“You’ll burn calories first thing and also feel energised for the rest of the day,” Lang said.

Do a quick internet search for ideas and just start your day on a good note.

- Instead of standing, gear up while waiting in a queue:

While standing in a line to buy tickets or stuff is inevitable, it is also possible include some quick physical activities while doing so. Lang suggested calf raises, glute squeezes, and belly breathing. While you might garner some odd looks, but the results will be worth it all.","A good workout on the go can always be accommodated in your travel schedule, whether for business or pleasure.

"Of Crumbling Forts, Faded Havels and Horror Films",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/feb/10/of-crumbling-forts-faded-havels-and-horror-films-1770434.html,"Saturday, February 10, 2018 06:33 PM +0530","Driving through the old town of Junagadh towards an ancient Buddhist cave gives the impression that the faded façades of old houses and havelis on the way have trapped the place in a time warp. You cross numerous maqbaras, mosques and ornate buildings showing its rich historical past. ‘Junagadh’ literally meaning ‘old fort’ lives up to the antiquity of its name: there are old forts, mausoleums, caves and ancient temples scattered across the town that gives a sepia tinge to travel.

The ancient town is an amalgamation of religion and culture, evident in its historic architecture. Its history stretches from the invasions of the Greeks (Alexander’s foray in India), the expansion drive of the Mauryas, Chudasama Rajputs, the Gujarat Sultanate, to the Babi dynasty nawabs under the Mughals.

assortment of spices in a shop

The tastes of Junagadh’s various rulers have influenced its architectural landscape. For history buffs, this makes a compelling reason to visit. Vertical thrill seekers are assured of an adrenaline rush by climbing the 9,999 steps from the Girnar Taleti to the Girnar Hills; the highest peak in Gujarat.

Hailed as an important pilgrimage site for both Jains and Hindus, it takes a hardy pilgrim and ample devotion to undertake the climb. While on a quest to explore the earliest of the three Buddhist caves dating back to 3rd-4th century AD, you have to tread a bit cautiously through narrow roads of the old city. The caves tell their own stories: while buying a ticket to enter the Khapra Kadiya caves protected by the Archaeological Survey of India, the ticket seller informs that its latest claim to fame is that a Bollywood horror film was shot there. The other two cave groups, Baba Pyare caves are in Uparkot fort.

Junagadh is heaven for spicing up life: local vendors can be seen selling mounds of spices. They supposedly come from Goa by sea and are fresh and reasonably priced. Spice shopping done, take a stroll to the ancient fort of Uparkot built during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya in 319 BC. You could peep through telescopes for just `10 to pay long distance obeisance to the revered Amba Mata temple and Gorakhnath temple. Entering the ornate triple gateway of Uparkot which is built on a plateau, the first sight you come across is a large cannon, still watching over the city. The fort was besieged 16 times but has never been taken.

As you pass the Damodar kund, don’t miss a white building that houses Ashok Lekshila—a boulder carved with the edicts of Emperor Ashoka in Pali. Though hunting was a royal past time of that age, Junagadh had its own green king: its last nawab Mahabat Khan III was an animal lover. Thanks to his efforts the Asiatic lions have survived in Sasan Gir forest since he had banned hunting and declared the area a protected forest reserve. Credit also goes to him for breeding fine Kathiawari horses and the Gir cows. Now the kings are gone, but the past lives on.

Nearby places

Veraval (83 km from Junagadh) is a coastal town with a bustling port and one of India's leading fishing centres.

Somnath (87 km from Junagadh) The historic Somnath temple stands in a beautiful garden on the beach. It houses one of the 12 sacred Jyotirlingas and sacred to Shiva devotees.

Sasan Gir Wildlife Sanctuary (80 km from Junagadh) The last home of the Asiatic lions makes for a wonderful wildlife experience. You require a prior permit to enter the sanctuary.","Driving through the old town of Junagadh towards an ancient Buddhist cave gives the impression that the faded façades of old houses and havelis on the way have trapped the place in a time warp.

The fourth edition of the fest commenced on Friday at the Srimanta Sankaradev Kalakshetra.



The day started with rock bands competing against each other.



Some groups also performed folk dance.



While they were entertaining the attendees with their energetic performances, others were gearing up to put up stalls.



The food section offered a variety of options -- multiple thalis, fish, chicken items and even sweet dishes.



As the sun bid adieu, M Brothers band took charge.



After singing a few Assamese numbers, the band's vocalist said to the crowd, which mostly consisted of people from the northeastern state: ""This festival is not just for Assamese and people from the northeast.""



And so, they gave the audience their own rock version of Grammy-winning composer A.R. Rahman's hit track ""Humma humma"". They left the audience dancing to a Bihu song.



The attendees continued to cheer. Why? Because they were thrilled to see veteran singer Arun Das taking the centre stage.



The 64-year-old strapped on a guitar and took charge of the microphone. He took the audience down the memory lane via his songs.



""I started my journey in 1973. The songs that I sang were from that time,"" Das told IANS after his performance.



He feels happy to connect with youngsters through his music but feels there are less platforms for people of his age group.



""I perform but the programmes are limited. Nowadays they want only young people "" he said.



""The last time I performed was in August 2017,"" added the talent, who would like fellow Assamese singers Zubeen Garg and Papon to collaborate with him.



Next was designer Jimi Das' show. Das' collection was a bold one. It had off-shoulder short dresses, backless pieces and more.



New designer Tania Ahmed's collection, on the other hand, was all about women empowerment.



""The collection is about warrior princesses. The theme is empowerment of women. Northeast women are given enough power to choose what they want to do as compared to women in other parts of the country,"" she told IANS about the range that consisted of dresses, tops and culottes, slit gowns, corsets.



""The silhouettes are western but the prints are similar to what tribals wear,"" she said.



Designer Swarnapori Phukan took a traditional turn by showcasing colourful Mekhela chador.



""I am working on Assam silk. The designs are all handmade. I want to popularise our traditional wear. People outside Assam can wear them too,"" said Phukan, who has found loyal customers in Punjab and Chennai.



What clicks with the women who are not from northeast India?



""Mekhela chador is more colourful than a sari. These are handloom items so they like to wear,"" added the designer, who uses Kolki, orchids and mayur designs for her creations.



Designer Elina Talukdar had the perfect accessory for the outfit. Her bamboo jewelleries -- long necklaces and ear pieces in different sizes and shapes -- with Mekhela chador seemed to be a match made in heaven.



It wasn't just people from the music, fashion and hospitality industries that took out time for the three-day fest. Assam Governor Jagdish Mukhi also attended the festival to inaugurate it. He expressed his happiness to be a part of the festival.

"Discover Peru to experience fascinating cultures, unique architecture",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/jan/07/discover-peru-to-experience-fascinating-cultures-unique-architecture-1746815.html,"Sunday, January 7, 2018 11:52 AM +0530","NEW DELHI: From the oldest civilization in America, to the largest and most powerful empire of the southern continent, Ancient Peru conserves the architectural and artistic vestiges of fascinating cultures.

Discovering them is a breathtaking experience. A single trip is not enough to discover all the wonders of Peru. Here we highlight just a few magical places and experiences that must be lived and appreciated when you visit this country.

Machu Picchu

Machu Picchu is an Incan city surrounded by temples, terraces and water channels, built on a mountaintop. It was built with huge blocks of stone joined to each other without any mortar. Today it has been designated cultural heritage of humanity in recognition of its political, religious and administrative importance during the age of the Incas.

Chavín de Huantar

An impressive archaeological complex from the Chavín culture, with 3000 year old temples and sculptures made from stone.

Chavín was one of the most important cultures of the pre-Inca era. Its principal temple, located in the department of Áncash, was one of the main oracles of Peru. People came to this center to consult the oracle and to make offerings to the gods.

A visit to the complex includes a tour through some of its passages and plazas. The exterior walls are decorated with a series of important heads: zoomorphic faces carved in stone that guard the temple. Other highlights of the complex include the Tello Pyramid, the Circular Plaza, the Rectangular Plaza, the North and South North Platforms, the New Temple and the Old Temple.

Chan Chan

Chan Chan is the biggest mud-brick settlement in pre-Hispanic America, with its pyramid-shaped temples, plazas and palace. One of the most significant archeological sites in Peru, Chan Chan is well worth a visit.

The centre of the city is a series of 10 walled citadels. One of the outstanding details of the citadels are its decorative walls in high relief with motifs including geometrical patterns, fish and birds, among others.

Caral

The oldest sacred city in America and, at over 5000 years old, is the cradle of one of the world's first civilizations.

The Sacred City of Caral represents the origin of Andean culture, and it is the most ancient civilization in the Americas, with historical roots reaching back more than 5,000 years.

The Caral complex boasts a variety of structures, most notably the six pyramids with their circular plazas. Based on archaeological findings such as tools and artifacts, it has been established that its inhabitants supported themselves by fishing and farming. Among the more important discoveries are the oldest ""quipu"" (an instrument used to record data) and 32 flautas (flutes) made from condor and pelican bones.

Nazca lines and geoglyphs

On the vast pampas of Nazca Jumana, mysterious lines and geoglyphs form geometric patterns as well the figures of animals, anthropomorphic beings, and plants, among others. But their outlines can only be recognized clearly from the sky aboard small airplanes.

Despite numerous studies, the lines are an enduring 2,000-year-old mystery that neither time, nor the regions powerful winds, nor any other natural adversaries have been able to erase.

Among the best-known figures are the hummingbird, the condor, and the monkey. There are more than 800 images outlined in the desert. The best way to view the extensive tracings is by flyover in the light aircraft that take off from the Nazca airport.

Kúelap

At the crest of the Amazonian Andes of northern Peru, is the imposing Fortress of Kuélap, built by the Chachapoyas, a pre-Inca culture that developed between 800 and 1470 A.D.

By its location and construction, the complex was designed to defend against other peoples; nevertheless the Chachapoyas were conquered by the Incas.

Amidst the green mountains, visitors can view the great, 20-meter (66 feet) high stone wall that protects the city and that begrudges only three entrances, in the form of narrow, walled alleys. In the interior of Kuélap, visitors may admire up to 420 circular stone houses with zigzag and rhomboid ornaments.

From above, the green landscape shows how nature protected this site. Reaching the archaeological complex is in itself an adventure that is well worth undertaking.","NEW DELHI: From the oldest civilization in America, to the largest and most powerful empire of the southern continent, Ancient Peru conserves the architectural and artistic vestiges of fascinating cultures.

The Spell of Saputara,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/travel/2018/jan/06/the-spell-of-saputara-1744817.html,"Saturday, January 6, 2018 04:10 PM +0530","A six-hour back-breaking, topsy-turvy drive from Vadodara brings us to Saputara, a tiny hill station, also the only one Gujarat can boast of. First impression: Beautiful stretches of richly green foliage reach out to the sky in an attempt to break free from the crowded grounds of the little plateau. It’s a quiet piece of haven that almost suddenly emerges from Gujarat’s otherwise rugged topography. It fits perfectly into the quintessential imagery that pops up as soon as we think of hills—endless greens, calm surroundings, long winding treks, picturesque dawn et al. But upon a close examination, Saputara doesn’t quite match Gujarat Tourism’s ambitious portrayal of the destination as the glorious land of culture, creativity and craft.

Saputara, which means a habitat of snakes, is located on the Sahyadri range at an altitude of 1,000 metres in the Dang district, about a reasonable four km away from Maharashtra borders. Its annual Monsoon Festival—organised last year from August 12 to September 10 which we witnessed—is an attempt by the state tourism board to put the sleepy hill station on the map.

a street bazaar; utensils at the tribal museum

The jamboree features magic shows, cultural performances, local food carts, exhibitions, adventure activities, small markets selling trinkets, a pay-per-play carnival of games and a small amusement park.

The festival has come to become a self-sufficient ecosystem for the local economy to flourish. Men and women look forward to setting up stalls to sell local, hand-made or hand-collected produce. The novelty of Saputara is that big fast food and lifestyle brands haven’t yet entered its localised systems.

The charming hill station thrives on everything that the communities within it can offer—be it food or lifestyle-related goods. According to official sources, over 2.5 lakh tourists visited the Saputara Monsoon Festival in 2015-16, generating a revenue of `13.19 crore for the local economy.Dotted along the sides of the streets are vendors with raw mango slices, sweet corn, dhokla, roasted or spiced peanuts and other little bites. In the surrounding vicinity, you have tribal women selling bamboo products, including bamboo pickles, raisins, salted peanuts, indigenous fruits, handmade toys, jewellery and clothes—all at a fraction of the price those are available at in cities.

Scattered across its length and breadth are tourist spots such as the artist’s village that displays tribal art and artefacts, the tribal museum which is rather ill-kept but has interesting keeps such as recreations of traditional dwellings, utensils, bamboo goods, jewellery, stuffed birds, earthenware among other things. There is also a small honeybee centre with fresh honey bottles. Having said that, Saputara will still need a lot more planning, imagination and financial strength to achieve the numbers it aspires for.

If you don’t limit yourself to just the monsoon festival, you’ll be better off. Going with moderate expectations will go a long way in helping you appreciate the smaller joys of life. Don’t expect opulent hotels, state-of-the-art facilities, exemplary hospitality, quick transportation or too many modern amenities. While there are a few privately owned hotels, the government is in the process of developing its accommodation under the name of Toran Hill Resort. Service is moody and food options are conservative.

Things you can expect in abundance from this place are verdant views that reach the horizon of the sprawling blue sky. For the best view of Saputara, climb atop the two hills further ahead of the base of Governor’s Hill, that in season time is a commercial place with food stalls, handicraft shops, activities, including horse, camel and motor bike riding, zip lining etc. A moderately difficult trek along the road brings you to what we’re talking about. A 30-minute hike up the first hill gradually introduces you to different gradations of Saputara’s geographic infiniteness.

As soon as you arrive, clusters of clouds begin to kiss the yellow-orange glimmer of the resplendent horizon. This is also the moment you realise there is more to Gujarat than the gregarious Asiatic Lions, the sublime Sabarmati Ashram and the multi-hued Rann Utsav.Saputara is good for a short getaway, ideal for people from Nagpur, Pune, Mumbai and Nashik. It brings you patience and a general sense of well being, before you shift gears back on to the fast track.

Fact File

By road: Ahmedabad: 409 km. Surat: 164 km. Mumbai: 250 km. Vadodara: 309 km. There are state transport buses and private coaches.

By rail: Waghai is the nearest railway station. For visitors from Surat, Ahmedabad and Mumbai, it’s Billimora.

By air: Vadodara is 309 km away.

Best time to visit: August-February","A six-hour back-breaking, topsy-turvy drive from Vadodara brings us to Saputara, a tiny hill station, also the only one Gujarat can boast of.
But upon a close examination, Saputara doesn’t quite match Gujarat Tourism’s ambitious portrayal of the destination as the glorious land of culture, creativity and craft.
The novelty of Saputara is that big fast food and lifestyle brands haven’t yet entered its localised systems.
The charming hill station thrives on everything that the communities within it can offer—be it food or lifestyle-related goods.

Hotdog gets its East Asian cousin,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/apr/07/hotdog-gets-its-east-asian-cousin-1797548.html,"Saturday, April 7, 2018 12:58 PM +0530","Not long ago Japanese cuisine was considered ‘too foreign’ for the Indian palate. But with the world becoming a global village, and more and more people travelling and exploring, food that once seemed inaccessible and unfamiliar became the new favourite.

As tastes evolved, so did gastronomic trends. To make inroads into an area where a nori sheet or a sashimi might not be received well, Japanese cuisine brought in influences from different cultures to Indian tables. It made food more accepting to Indian taste buds, while retaining the authentic touch. Sushi burgers, sushi taco, tortilla rolled sushi, or rice paper wrapped sushi rolls are newer ways in which one can soon expect to see sushi being served.

Till lately the preserve of expensive restaurants in five-star hotels, the trademark Japanese food is being offered at affordable prices by Simply Sushi—it deals in Japanese speciality—at Ambience Mall, Vasant Kunj and Select CityWalk, Saket, in Delhi. Not just that, the menu has gone one step ahead in incorporating a Japanese version of the quintessential American street food—the hotdog. Known as ‘Japadog’, these are much more than your regular fried sausage in bread slathered with ketchup and mustard.

A comfort food by nature, Japadog evolves from simple mustard and relish to seaweed, wasabi and other Japanese condiment garnishing. It is quite simple. Take a chicken hotdog—say no to the fried version and go for a cold cut one—add a dash of Japanese twist with Teriyaki sauce, Japanese mayo, caramelised onions, and voila! There are also flavours like kimchi and chilli bean.

Spearheaded by internationally renowned chef Yutaka Saito, Executive Chef at Simply Sushi, one can see how the menu makes an effort to understand the nuanced Indian palate. The Japadog was introduced under the guidance of Mayank Tiwari, Group Executive Chef of PVR.

“When it comes to food, we eat with our eyes first. This leads to a key emphasis on the technique used in preparation. Each item on the menu served at Simply Sushi lends a diversified texture profile, ensuring a burst of flavours to the palate,” says Chef Saito, who has been in India for the past seven years, and needless to say, knows what the Indian palate wants.

For instance, he knows that a large clientele is vegetarian and alienating them would lead to revenue loss. Thus, breaking the myth that Japanese is only for those who eat seafood; 40 per cent of the menu at Simply Sushi is vegetarian.

“It is very difficult to acquire fresh and good quality ingredients to serve to our guests. So, most of the ingredients are flown in directly from the Tsukiji market in Japan,” says Chef Saito. This only adds to the authentic flavour of their batera sushi, temaki rolls, maki sushi rolls and Japadogs. And very soon

the chef will be ready to offer his patrons the typical fries with an innovative Japanese twist.

How the Restaurant Evolved

The Simply Sushi brand was launched in 2015 at PVR Director’s Cut so that the patrons could indulge in Japanese cuisine inside the cinemas. The journey that started inside the auditoriums soon led to a sushi counter at PVR Director’s Cut, as also sushi being included in the menu at PVR Gold properties. Recently, the brand brought Simply Sushi ‘out-of-the-box office’ with a standalone location at Select CityWalk.","Not long ago Japanese cuisine was considered ‘too foreign’ for the Indian palate.

Here is what Organic India points is a reason for the switch in preferences:

• Individuals are making themselves aware of healthy ways of living. Smarter consumers prefer to eat healthy and spend on healthy food than to spend on medical treatments.

• The constant checks made on certified organic products and use of composed manure reduce the chances of various diseases like cancers, brain damage or infant abnormalities.

• Being high on nutritional levels, organic food is healthier and fresher to consume as compared to conventional food.

• Organic products contain a high level of minerals, vitamins and antioxidants than conventional farm food grown with the fertilizer.

• An organic diet excludes toxic chemicals and genetically modified organisms (GMO) as chemical fertilizers and pesticides are not used while growing the crop.

• Organic farming is better for the environment.

• To opt for safe food and a healthy lifestyle, people prefer organic food as compared to other products.

• The empty capsules used for Organic India’s Health supplements are made of plant cellulose (made from pine tree), so it is not harmful for human intake.","NEW DELHI: The demand of organic products is increasing majorly due to the health benefits, avoidance of chemical usage and ongoing changing patterns of lifestyle and food consumption patterns.

Pasta can be part of healthy diet!,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/apr/04/pasta-can-be-part-of-healthy-diet-1796826.html,"Wednesday, April 4, 2018 12:33 PM +0530","WASHINGTON: Turns out, pasta can be a part of a healthy diet without packing the pounds.

Wait, what?

According to a new study by St. Michael's Hospital, carbohydrates get a lot of bad press and blame for the obesity epidemic, but this negative attention may not be deserved for pasta.

Unlike most 'refined' carbohydrates, which are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, pasta has a low glycemic index, meaning it causes smaller increases in blood sugar levels than those caused by eating foods with a high glycemic index.

A team of researchers undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of all of the available evidence from randomised controlled trials, the gold standard of research design.

They identified 30 randomised control trials involving almost 2,500 people who ate pasta instead of other carbohydrates as part of a healthy low-glycemic index diet.

""The study found that pasta didn't contribute to weight gain or increase in body fat,"" said lead author John Sievenpiper. ""In fact analysis actually showed a small weight loss. So contrary to concerns, perhaps pasta can be part of a healthy diet such as a low GI diet.""

The people involved in the clinical trials on an average ate 3.3 servings of pasta a week instead of other carbohydrates. One serving equals about one-half cup of cooked pasta. They lost about one-half kilogram over a median follow-up of 12 weeks.

The study authors stressed that these results are generalisable to pasta consumed along with other low-glycemic index foods as part of a low-glycemic index diet. They caution more work is needed to determine if the lack of weight gain will extend to pasta as part of other healthy diets.

""In weighing the evidence, we can now say with some confidence that pasta does not have an adverse effect on body weight outcomes when it is consumed as part of a healthy dietary pattern,"" said Sievenpiper.

The study is published in the journal BMJ Open.","WASHINGTON: Turns out, pasta can be a part of a healthy diet without packing the pounds.

Mushrooms that have been used medicinally for centuries are one quirky ingredient for coffee.

Apparently, the brand leading the charge is Four Sigmatic. Company’s founder, Tero Isokauppila explains health benefits of variety of mushrooms. He dwelled on the kinds like reishi, a mushroom he says will keep your skin healthy, chaga, which he says is rich in antioxidants, cordyceps, which he says enhances performance, reported the Washington Post.

Not restricted to coffee alone, mushrooms are found in other beverages like shakes and tea as well.

For instance, wellness cafe in Los Angeles, such as Lifehouse Tonics lets you order a “shroom shake” or a lemon juice tea with mushrooms in it, the report said.

The mushroom coffee is purportedly an anti-inflammatory, and is supposed to regulate blood sugar levels and boost metabolism.

However, registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Mascha Davis, said, “There is some research showing some beneficial utilities in some mushrooms, but I think some of these companies that want to sell them overstate the benefits.”","LOS ANGELES: Listen up, coffee aficionados, add a new caffeine fad to that long list of already existent varieties of coffee and let us all call it the mushroom one.

Called ‘Sushi Unrolled’, the menu includes sushi pizzas, tacos, pita pockets and more.

We started the meal with the Cross-breeding Tuna pizza. The rice is made into a flat cake and lightly fried, and is topped with thin slices of marinated tuna, jalapenos, cream cheese mayo, capers and mustard dressing. The flavours were subtle and blended well together, but personally, we think this pizza can go either way with customers - you either love it or hate it.

Next was the pita pocket version of sushi - and we tried the veg and non-vegetarian options. Called Inari sushi, the sushi rice is wrapped and seasoned in deep fried tofu pockets. The Progressive Vegetarian had miso lotus root, smoked tofu, cucumber and sweet potato crisps - a great combination of flavours and textures, with the lotus root adding that much-needed crunch. The Liberal Tobimayo - the non-vegetarian option - was filled with a generous amount of crab meat, mayo, chives, avacado, shallots and topped with prawn crackers. This, while tasty, was extremely filling, a bit too heavy, we thought.

While the Inari is a great option for those with a mighty appetite, the tofu pocket had gotten soggy with the sheer number of fillings inside. We tried the sushi taco next, where the outer layer is made crispy like a taco shell. We tried the Spicy Salmon option, and the crispy outer layer made the overall texture of the dish stand out.

Our personal favourite were the sushi rolls - called Hosomaki sushi - which were also served beautifully. We tried two options - the Grilled Soy Braised Wild Mushrooms and Cheese and the Teriyaki Chicken and Togarashi. Both were delicious and though the cheese might scare some off, it really blends well with the dish.

Overall, we enjoyed having our tastebuds teased with the different innovations of the sushi. Paired with their signature cocktails and yummy desserts, the meal was definitely an interesting one.

I think the way a dish is presented, the plating style, the isolated flavours and the fact that it looks so clean is amazing. That’s probably something I use in my cooking as well. I experimented for about six months before I realised that I could do this on a daily basis.

There are many unique ingredients one comes across during one’s culinary pursuits. The ones that have simply awed me for their distinct character, aesthetic beauty and flavour are fiddle head ferns and morels. I came across both in my hometown Uttaranchal.

Mushrooms being one of my favourites, I would definitely think of morels as one my most favourite ingredients.

Morels are edible sac fungi or simply put ‘mushrooms’ - the beauty is that they can’t be cultivated. They are hand picked and harvested, the complex symbiotic relationship these wonderful fungi have with trees cannot be replicated in an artificial environment. The flavour is earthy, nutty, meaty and intense but never over powering. They truly satisfy every quality one looks for - olfactory, visual, taste and texture.

Like the saying goes ‘morels are everywhere and impossible to find’. I have never had a chance to forage for them but was gifted a few hundred grams by a close friend and a few hundred grams of fresh morels are a treasure not to be taken lightly.

I love them sauteed in butter and seasoned with sea salt and if I really feel adventurous, then have them with soft gooey eggs as an accompaniment.

I have never been able to serve them at our restaurant (except on our Christmas menu which was well received), because of the difficulty in procuring them.

I would like to actually go to the mountains and forage for them myself one day - that would be a fantastic culinary adventure.

The positive feedbacks helped too. Now I’m a director and chef at Forage. The food we offer here is also quite different from the others in the city.

My partners, Mayura and Rajnish, are all runners and swimmers. We brought a change in our lifestyle when we took interest in the sport. When I got into competitive running, I changed my outlook towards the way I look and maintain myself. I stopped having dairy products, processed food and anything that had preservatives.

This was something I did for myself, but when Mayura, Rajnish and I realised that this might be something others like us will also be interested in, we decided to open Forage. We need food that is nutritious and gives us enough energy to make it through the day.

Don't want to step out but craving that Thalappakatti mutton biryani for lunch? Pick up the phone and call Pappasree Baburaj, who along with her mother started cooking and catering food to bachelors and families in the city. Her speciality? Entirely non-vegetarian food.

Pappasree's first order came through a few months back, earlier this year. After receiving an overwhelming feedback, the 25-year-old was motivated to pursue this new-found venture with greater enthusiasm. “Initially, my mother used to run a women’s hostel, where she used to cook for the girls there. All of them loved her cooking, this too was a big motivation for us to start this business,” she shares.

Pappasree straddles two worlds — being a working professional, and engaging herself in cooking and catering. “I leave for work at 8 am and return by 7 pm. I complete my orders either before or after work. When you are a home chef, you can be flexible about cooking timings. I can accept and reject orders based on my preferences, but my ultimate goal is to enjoy what I do and ensure my customers are happy,” she shares.

Her Facebook page played a big role in building a client base. “I am a part of a few food groups on Facebook, and these groups helped me get hold of customers I can cater to. There are so many families who have settled down in Chennai from my native (Madurai) and I am sure they’d be missing the non-vegetarian food that Madurai is known for. I can guarantee that I can cook all the Madurai non-veg specialities,"" she says.

Pappasree’s duties don’t stop at handling the kitchen; she also delivers what she cooks. “A lot of hard work has gone into building my own kitchen with the motive of opening my own restaurant. This business has fewer investments and that is exactly why I started off with this,” she explains. While Pappasree has no standard menu, orders are customisable and range from `100 to `200 per person.

The green cook

Ever heard of couple goals? If not, here is a classic example. Meet Jayalakshmi Vaidhyanathan (61) and her husband Vaidhyanathan (68), who form a great team, only to make sure the lady of the house pursues what she loves — cooking.

It is often said that a woman is behind every man’s success, but not in the case of this 61-year-old ‘Iyer aathu maami’. Jayalakshmi is an independent woman, who runs her own small kitchen and supplies home-cooked food.

“It all started when I was a young girl, and assisted my mother in the kitchen. My love and passion for cooking began many years ago. After my marriage, I had two daughters and now I have lovely grandchildren. My love for the art has not died down,” she shares and goes on to introduce her husband, who has been her pillar

of support.

Sixty eight-year-old Vaidhyanathan works in a private company and helps his wife before and after his work hours. “My office timings are usually 11 am to 5 pm. Once I am done with work I help her with delivering the food, and also shop for veggies,” he says.

Jayalakshmi started off this business three years ago. What keeps her going is the feedback from her customers. She caters food to customers who live in and around Valasaravakkam, including Anna Nagar, KK Nagar, Vadapalani, Koyambedu, Mogappair and Virugambakkam.

“I don’t cook anything that is extraordinary for my customers. It is just the usual sambhar, rasam, porial, kutty, chapathi and subji. When I cook for myself and my husband, I prepare some more of the same food based on my orders. But I do it with a lot of passion. I think that is why my customers like my food,” she shares.

“Even before I started to cook and sell, for about 10 years I used to make pickles, ready-to-eat powders and vadams (fries).” Pointing at her daughter Srividya, she says, “Srividya helped me expand my business, by posting about my services on social media.”

But, what’s so special about Jayalakshmi’s kitchen? All the ingredients for her dishes are handcrafted and made by her from scratch. “Right from sambhar podi to idli podi and chapathi maavu, I make it all at home. The vegetables are freshly bought from Koyambedu. We also take up festival orders and make special dishes, including poli. Also for one meal, which easily serves two people I charge `120 plus `20 for as delivery charges. Each meal pack has rice, two kinds of gravy and one porial,” she explains.

Jayalakshmi and Vaidhyanathan are also green crusaders. They deliver food in stainless steel tiffin boxes and hot packs.

The bread winner

Bored of having the same idli, sambhar, dosai, upma for breakfast every day? 'The Food Saga’ can fill your plate with fresh home-baked vegan-eggless breads. Vegan and eggless, that does sound different? This is what makes Manisha Kumbhat a unique home-based chef.

As we enter Manisha's kitchen, the aroma of freshly baked-bread fills up our senses. The Food Saga is the brainchild of this 53-year-old homemaker, who now bakes her own bread and delivers it to many of her customers across the city. Married in 1989, Manisha is a mother of two kids. She started cooking and selling food in 1997, and for three years she continued to do so. She took a long break to focus on her kids, but she did not stop cooking. ""Even then I used to try new recipes and serve my kids, and they always enjoyed my food. My son has always been a big critic,” she says.

The cuisines she cooks include Mexican, Lebanese, Chinese, Italian and Indian. “It took three years for me to reach where I am today. I got many customers through word of mouth, and later my daughter persuaded me to make Food Saga popular, and started an Instagram and Facebook page,” she says.

While she bakes different kinds of bread, pita-hummus tops Manisha's menu.

Recalling one of the best feedbacks from her customers, an overwhelmed Manisha says, “It was only recently that my customer's little daughter tasted my food and said that she wanted to adopt me.”

“The customer must place the order with me at least three days in advance. I outsource my deliveries and the customer has to bear the delivery cost as well. However, I pay for delivery charges if the order is more than `2,500.” Calling herself a workaholic, Manisha shares, “There have been days when I have not slept throughout the night to complete orders."" Everything from shopping, chopping, cooking, and cleaning is handled by Manisha.

Manisha loves to travel. “My travel has helped me learn about food. Any place I go to, I try out the food there and understand its preparation so that I get the taste right in my kitchen,” she says. Most of her ingredients are home-made.

At the Food Saga, finger foods cost about `50 and based on the order, on an average, the costs go up to `125 per person (excluding delivery charges). “My long-time dream has been to open a food truck,” she says.

The Mini twist

Having a lazy day and plan to eat some delicious north Indian food? Meet Mini, an enterprising home chef.

Cooking, for Mini, is synonymous with adventure. When Mini got married, she was clueless about cooking. So she decided to take the ladles, spoons...and other kitchen accoutrements in her own hands, and start cooking. ""I used to watch a lot of food-based videos, read recipes and try it at home. But every dish had a Mini-twist. This slowly became my passion,” she says.

Mini's husband and her eight-year-old son have been silently supporting her. “I must say at eight, my son has been very understanding, he is aware that I love cooking and has adjusted a lot. My husband takes care of our son while I complete my orders.”

Malai methi, paneer butter masala, rajma chawal, aloo mutter… name it and Mini can cook it up in just 45 minutes. “I accept instant orders and take around 45 minutes to one hour to finish my cooking. I do not believe in saying no to my customers,"" says Mini.

Mini has been in the business for 10 years, “But my learning has not stopped, I continue to learn as I get new orders. I left my career in a corporate firm and took this up. And now my motive is to learn baking,” she says.

On weekends, Mini tries out different cuisines at various restaurants in the city. “I am a big-time foodie and I love to eat out. I make sure my Saturdays and Sundays are to eat out with my family,” she says.

“Onion and garlic are two ingredients that add a lot of flavour to any dish. I once got an order from a Jain customer, who did not want onion or garlic in their food. I took that up as a challenge and gave my best. And my customers were more than just happy.”

Although Mini does not offer door delivery, in exceptional cases she does accept one or two delivery orders. Her package ranges from about `120 to `150 that serves one 250 ml of subji.","Pappasree’s duties don’t stop at handling the kitchen; she also delivers what she cooks.
“A lot of hard work has gone into building my own kitchen with the motive of opening my own restaurant.
Jayalakshmi is an independent woman, who runs her own small kitchen and supplies home-cooked food.
“It all started when I was a young girl, and assisted my mother in the kitchen.
So she decided to take the ladles, spoons...and other kitchen accoutrements in her own hands, and start cooking.","['customers', 'cooking', 'started', 'delivery', 'mini', 'cook', 'work', 'kitchen', 'orders', 'food']",
What’s cooking this Easter?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/28/whats-cooking-this-easter-1793921.html,"Thursday, March 29, 2018 01:53 PM +0530","CHENNAI: As many in the city are preparing to get their hands on their favourite Easter bunnies, there are others who are religiously following the 50-day lent and waiting to welcome Jesus Christ. Observed three days after Good Friday, Easter marks the spirit of rebirth and life, and celebrates the resurrection of Jesus from his tomb after he was crucified.

“I have always cherished memories of celebrating Easter. I was the youngest of eight children in my family and I would observe my mother and sisters taking care of all the preparations,” says Celine Joseph, who along with her husband runs Celine’s Kitchen, a catering service base in the city.

Easter is special in every Christian household; spending a day in mourning on Good Friday, waking up early the day after to attend Easter mass, followed by waiting to get back home to dig into the food set on the table. “When I was younger, we would wake up to go for the 3 am mass and then come back, make appams and break our lent. Now things have changed— mass timings and duration have become shorter. But what has not changed is the tasty food that we make every Easter,” says Benny Joseph.

The Easter feast that follows the lent and Good Friday are most awaited in Christian homes. While the dishes may change in each country and/or state, what is common is the abundance of non-vegetarian dishes.

God’s own country, Kerala, celebrates Easter with its own platter of a seven-course meal ranging from a variety of appetizers to a long list of main course dishes. From the crispy beef/chicken cutlets to the fluffy paalappams and spicy duck roast, the Easter meal is sure to make every foodie go weak on their knees.

“We traditionally break our lent with the paalappam and duck stew.

That is followed by a heavy lunch in the afternoon where we have rice with beef, mor, kuttanadu fish curry, karimeen fry, chicken curry, and the list goes on,” explains Celine. She is from Kuttanad, which is in Alappuzha district of Kerala. “In Kuttanad, the main dish is the duck and karimeen, as both are available abundantly. They weigh more than what we get in the shops here,” points out Celine.

Although they stick to their traditional recipes, Celine admits that after moving to Chennai and cooking for people from different regions, she has added a few extra dishes to the list. “Some people want a few vegetarian dishes or may want a different kind of chicken curry,” she says. However, she mostly follows her mother’s recipes and refuses to tamper with them.

Why chocolate turns white and how you can prevent it,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/27/why-chocolate-turns-white-and-how-you-can-prevent-it-1793233.html,"Tuesday, March 27, 2018 04:41 PM +0530","NEW DELHI: You're about to eat your mid-work chocolate snack and then you see a white, powdery or streaky substance on the surface of your afternoon delight. What is this stuff?

Firstly, this doesn’t necessarily mean the chocolate is old, or inedible.

This white ‘thing’ on the chocolate does not mean that the chocolate is mouldy. It means the chocolate has suffered from something called the “bloom”.

There are two kinds of chocolate bloom: fat bloom and sugar bloom.

Sugar bloom occurs when moisture comes in contact with the chocolate. The chocolate that you eat typically contains sugar.

Fat bloom is more complicated and may be caused by a combination of factors. These include improper storage conditions, changes in temperature, or poor tempering.

In fact, this strange phenomenon, known as “fat bloom”, is all down to how we store our favourite chocolatey treats.

It happens to be the biggest cause of customer complaints and costs the chocolate industry millions of pounds every year.

So, what can you do to prevent it?

To properly store your chocolate, an ideal situation is to keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place, such as a cellar or pantry.

If you live in a hot, humid area and you don’t happen to have air-conditioning at your place, store it in the coolest place in the house, typically a lower cupboard or a dark pantry.

You can carefully wrap and seal your chocolates in a couple of layers of plastic wrap or ziplock bags to keep moisture and odors out.

Lastly, you can also seal the bags in an airtight container, and then place it in the warmest spot in your refrigerator, often the top and middle shelves, toward the front.","NEW DELHI: You're about to eat your mid-work chocolate snack and then you see a white, powdery or streaky substance on the surface of your afternoon delight.

Trio of taste,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/24/trio-of-taste-1791093.html,"Saturday, March 24, 2018 07:09 PM +0530","A year ago, restaurateur Rushad Ginwala was contemplating a fresh radical menu for a new restaurant he was launching in Ahmedabad. He already owned the American diner-themed restaurant chain, Tomato’s which serves international cuisine. Mirch Masala, his North Indian speciality restaurant brand had expanded across Ahmedabad, Vadodara and other cities.

“I wanted to innovate, but also didn't want to drive business away from my existing brands,’’ explains Rushad, “I love Parsi food at home, and food served at the homes of my many friends of whom, some are Sindhi, Gujarati, Maharashtrian, Rajasthani, Mangalorean and Tamil. You don’t get to order most of these regional dishes in any restaurant in Ahmedabad.’’

Experience had taught Rushad that restaurants serving regional Indian food with a modern take on traditional recipes, dishes plated in the western style and fusion food were wildly popular in the big cities. “I love Mumbai’s vada pao, Irani café-style kheema pao and Goan sausage pao with twists and tweaks,’’ he says.

Hence, the enterprising culinary maestro settled on the innovative oeuvre as the bill of fare for his new restaurant. After many discussions with his team, Rushad named it ''Dhoom Dhaam.'' Interior designer, Ariane Ginwala was told to envisage a décor that reflected the theme—regional cuisine presented in a modern style. Dhoom Dhaam has contemporary interiors, monochromatic walls and modern streamlined furniture decorated with traditional motifs with brass accents. Even the utensils are modern-ish with a subtle Indian touch.

The highlight of the place is an installation of lights made with traditional brass and copper thalis that show off the mood of eponymous celebration, and is accompanied by hanging lamps. Displays of wooden ladles and a collection of mortar-and-pestle sets extend the food metaphor.

“The restaurant was soft-launched in mid-2017, and we keep experimenting with novel culinary versions from different regions—Ratalu Nariyal Pattice and Titora-Khakra from South Gujarat, Jodhpuri Mirchi Vada from Marwar, Paniyaram from the South, Nellai Kozhi Varuval from Tamil Nadu, Dabeli from Kutch, Dhansak of the Parsis, Sai Bhaji of the Sindhis, Prawn Gassi from Mangaluru, Meen Pollichathu from Kerala, Batatyachi Bhaji-Amti-Shrikhand which is a classic mini meal in Maharashtra, Saoji Chicken from Nagpur, and so forth. We also worked on creating unusual desserts like the Gorpabdi Cheese Cake which has the distinctive Gujarati taste,’’ he smiles.

Rushad is not the only new gastronomic adventurer in town. Samir Patel, owner of Kolkata Konnection has thrown open a table with a difference. “I grew up in Kolkata, and meet many people in Ahmedabad who remember the kathi rolls of Kolkata fondly, either from their visits or having lived there for a time’’ he explains, “I studied information technology but had always thought of opening a restaurant with a Kolkata theme.""

The restaurant has photographs of the city of joy on its walls, and is full of props of Kolkata buses and taxis.’’ Patel doesn’t serve Bengali food though. The menu is Kolkata-style Mughlai food. “Our customers come for Egg Rolls, Mutton Rolls, Mughlai Paratha, Mutton Chaap, Aloo Dum in the Kolkata street style, and of course, the Kolkata-style Chicken Biryani. Snacks such as Egg Chops and Chicken Cutlets are a hit.

His clients are not just Bengalis and former Kolkata residents, but are also Sindhis, Punjabis, Gujaratis, South Indians,’’ he says. Meanwhile, Chaitanya Dalvi has brought the cuisine of Mumbai to Ahmedabad through the nostalgically charming restaurant he owns called Madhavrao. Dalvi explains, “Growing up in Mumbai, I loved Maharashtrian food and local street eats. Though my main business is textiles, I started a restaurant serving such dishes.’’

In 2018, he launched ''Madhavrao,'' which has been designed to give the look and feel of aristocratic homes in Maharashtra or Goa. Chaitanya was also inspired by the décor of the colonial period clubs of Mumbai: carved wooden cabinets, colonial-style tropical dining chairs, polished wooden tables, brick-clad walls, wooden partitions with compartments carrying spice and food jars, antiques, artefacts and ornate light fittings.

The walls of the Madhavrao are festooned with ancestral photographs and portraits. An impressive wooden staircase leads to the second dining area that is largely used for parties and groups. The menu includes Maharashtrian snacks like Sabudana Vada, Vada Pao, Kothimbir Wadi, Dadpe Pohe, Misal and pancake-like Thalipith. The entrées are eclectic—Zunka Bhakri (chickpea flour porridge served with rice bhakri), Bharli Vangi Puri which is a substantial one dish meal of stuffed eggplant with puri, Bataka Dungli Biscuit Bhakri and Masalabhat Tamatar Sar.

The stuffed Puran Poli is redolent with aromatic spices. Madhavrao also serves Gujarati and Rajasthani dishes, South Indian snacks, and Gujarati sweets. With such an imaginative culinary legerdemain, Ahmedabad’s Tasty Three are only enhancing the broth.","A year ago, restaurateur Rushad Ginwala was contemplating a fresh radical menu for a new restaurant he was launching in Ahmedabad.

The 'real' Hyderabadi ice creams from Moazzam Jahi market- The New Indian Express,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/24/the-real-hyderabadi-ice-creams-from-moazzam-jahi-market-1791592.html,"Saturday, March 24, 2018 06:52 AM +0530","HYDERABAD: Moazzam Jahi market is a major landmark at Nampally. The market, named after Prince Moazzam Jah, the second son of the last Nizam, was constructed around 80 years ago using granite stones and has a clock tower to boot. MJ market as it is known colloquially has many shops now, but most well-known among these are the old ice cream outlets, serving hand churned seasonal fruit ice creams loved by one and all.

From a time much before the proliferation of modern ice creams and stone creations, these hand churned ice creams had made a name for themselves in Hyderabad. In 1951, Mohammed Haleem set up an ice cream shop at MJ Market known as Famous Ice Cream, which really caught the fancy of Hyderabadis for offering fruit ice creams at affordable rates.

Over a period of time, MJ Market has become the preferred location for asli Hyderabadi ice creams with around four different shops having their own loyal fan following. Any old resident of Hyderabad will vouch for one of these shops for their favourite ice creams, which have no colour or preservatives added to them. The open space next to the market is lined up with plastic chairs, and always has a motley crowd enjoying these desserts.

The handmade ice creams are prepared using fresh fruit pulp, along with milk and sugar. Mango, litchi, sapota, custard apple, fig and muskmelon are some of the seasonal fruits which provide a touch of variety during different parts of the year. Unlike the modern ice creams, the variety from MJ Market lacks a little creaminess. However, they retain the original fruit flavours very well and given their value-for-money pricing emerge as clear winners.

Apart from Famous, the other three places who are sought-after are Bilal, Gafoor, and Shah. The ice creams, which are also known locally as pot ice creams, are usually prepared in the shops itself and has pricing as low as `35. Over a period of time, with competition from many modern ice cream parlours in the city, as well as national ice cream brands launched in Hyderabad, some of the shops have started offering sundaes and frozen desserts too.

Production of the ice creams has also become mechanized with use of a motor for churning. Some of the products even come from factories set up by these shops away from their location. Inexplicably, none of them have yet set up shop in the cash-rich Cyberabad. However, people throng here still to get the old world charm of the place and enjoy the traditional fruit ice creams, especially during summer and the holy month of Ramzan.

"Travellers, camp here. There are tents!",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/23/travellers-camp-here--there-are-tents-1791531.html,"Saturday, March 24, 2018 06:51 AM +0530","BENGALURU : Bengaluru, which homes many travellers and travel-loving people, is likely to welcome the first ever travel-themed café in the city – The Vacationer’s Café — located in Koramangala.

Interestingly painted walls with anecdotes from Goa, witty quotes, bookshelf and a dummy wooden boat adds to the oomph at The Vacationers Cafe. The highlight of the café is certainly the tents, which accommodate 4-5 people with a small table. This is meant to give the diners an experience of camping.

While the restaurant serves only vegetarian along with some egg-based food, the dishes are inspired by food in various cities and many cuisines.

The restaurant is owned and run by 24-year-old Jinal Chande who completed her Bachelor’s in Marketing and worked in various companies before finding her calling here.

The food doesn’t disappoint; it rather flows well with the whole travel theme. Let’s look at the top 5 food items that you shouldn’t miss out when you are camping or rather dining at The Vacationer’s Café.

GOOD Selfie Sizzler

I am not sure about selfie but this dish is a paparazzi-magnet with its presentation. With momos placed on a rice bed with grilled vegetables, it is impossible to be ignored. It is momos we are talking about, a dish which brought the nation together when there was a rumour that would be banned. When you have momos leading the sizzler, it just can’t go wrong.

French Connection

Vanilla ice cream, coffee and chocolate syrup, Kitkat – everything in a small glass of goodness, what’s not to love? This mocktail is worth your attention and will kiss your sweet cravings goodbye. It has a good smooth texture with a balanced sweetness.

Marine Kaati Rolls

We can argue that the best Kaati rolls are from Kolkata but this roll is equally good. People who like meat, don’t be disappointed. The kheema paneer rolled in the chappati will satiate every appetite.

Mac N Cheese Bites

Can you imagine Mac N Cheese oozing out with every bite? That’s exactly what it is. A simple classic snack that is best enjoyed with any hot beverage.

Tangy Chilli Pizza

Sounds interesting, right? It will surprise you as well. Capsicum, cumin powder and chilli soaked in tamarind juice, giving a hint of tanginess with every bite. That’s exactly where this pizza scores very high.

Bad

Absolutely nothing bad about the food. The only drawback with The Vacationers Café is its location.

Its surroundings mars visibility. But with its unique theme and good food, this place is already attracting a good number of footfall.

Mama’s bowls for all your Asian cravings,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/23/mamas-bowls-for-all-your-asian-cravings-1791540.html,"Saturday, March 24, 2018 06:50 AM +0530","BENGALURU : The concept of ‘bowls’ in the food world has been a blessing for those of us looking for some comfort. All your food needs are met in a single large bowl, and you can even share them with people. Our latest visit to Mamagoto, with their Mama’s Bowl Manifesto menu, captured exactly those emotions. With eight veg and non-veg options, these bowl meals are designed to satisfy all your Asian food cravings. We headed over to Mamagoto on a crowded night, and started our meal with duck stuffed baos. The baos were tasty, and the meat was well-flavoured. After a rather long wait, we were brought two vegetarian bowls — Tofu 2 Way and Medium Hot Mushroom.

The first bowl had tofu cooked in pepper sauce another version that was prepared with salt and pepper and served with udon noodles and veggies — a generous portion and flavours that screamed comfort. Our personal favourite from the night was the Medium Hot Mushroom bowl - assorted mushrooms, chilli reduction, spring onion, udon noodles and dry red chillies. We couldn’t put our forks down, as the different textures of the various mushrooms paired with the udon noodles, took us back to a rainy night where you’re sitting in front of the TV with your loved ones and have ordered Chinese takeout from that place you love around the corner.

The Aromatic Rice Meal Fish was next, and comprised a homemade chili sauce, a chunk of fresh fish, served with Jasmine fried rice and rocket salad. While we found the sauce to be a tad bit too salty, the rocket salad was much-needed to balance out the excess sodium chloride. The Hot China Action was another bowl we tried, but don’t let the fiery pictures fool you.

This dish, which is made up of slow-poached chicken with Schezuan chili oil and served with ginger and scallion sticky fried rice, doesn’t quite pack the punch you’d expect if you’re looking for something spicy and flavourful. The poached chicken needed to be doused with a more than generous portion of chilli oil for the flavours to come through, but on that note, we did enjoy the sticky fried rice with its mild flavours of ginger and spring onions. Other options one can go for are the 8 treasure Bowl Lamb, In Da (Canton) House Pork and the Aromatic Rice Meal and Tofu. The menu is on till May 20, starting at `599.","BENGALURU : The concept of ‘bowls’ in the food world has been a blessing for those of us looking for some comfort.

"Step into creamy, tasty world of cheese",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/23/step-into-creamy-tasty-world-of-cheese-1791560.html,"Saturday, March 24, 2018 06:48 AM +0530","BENGALURU : When we go a store to buy cheese for that fancy dinner party we’re hosting, we rarely think about all the effort and time that goes into fermenting milk to get that perfect gouda, cheddar or parmesan. One man changing how we look at cheese is Aditya Raghavan, whose fascination for the dairy product has taken him on journeys of discovery, exploration and lots of cows!A former physicist, Aditya says that he has always had a love for food and cooking. Experimenting with making cheese, bread, beer and curing meat at home as hobbies, Aditya, who was a postdoctoral fellow in Canada, quit this and worked on cheese farms. “I lost interest in research and teaching, which is when I decided to do something in food.

Working on two different cheese farms in Canada helped hone my skills. I learnt so much about farming and about raising animals at these cheese farms, skills that are rare to acquire in India,” he says.

What drew him towards cheese was the process of making it. He says that he was ‘fascinated’ by how milk could be kept away for months, after which it gives you something so different and unique. Talking about favourite cheeses to make and eat, Aditya chooses two French cheeses — Époisses to eat and Tomme to make. “Tomme is a French cheese that has simple, creamy flavours. And the natural flavour of the milk really comes out in it,” he says.

Having journeyed to many places on cheese quest. Aditya says that one experience on a cheese farm in California will always be a fond one. “A Portugese family settled on the outskirts of San Francisco will always be one of my fondest cheese memories. I remember driving up to the rustic farm with the strong smell of manure everywhere. The cheese cellar there was filled with all these amazing aromas. Now, each time I visit California, I make it a point to go there.”

While he says that cheese made in Himalayas is good, he says that India is not suited for making the Western style of cheeses. “Making cheese requires a cool environment for fermentation to happen. The ideal temperature inside a cheese cellar is 10-12 degrees. While the cheese you get in Kodaikanal, which is quite popular, isn’t bad, there is nothing cutting edge about it. One can still find some good cheese being used in the northeast, as yak milk imparts a nice flavour to the product.”

Aditya says that he has no plans on starting his own cheese farm, and wants to continue being a cheese consultant. Talking about what this entails, he says, “As a consultant, I go to farms that are engaged in selling dairy products such as milk and ghee, and are looking to add value to their products. I take them through the entire process of cheese making — from how to set up a cheese cellar, how fermentation and aging work to the actual business part of it where they have to sell their products.”

In India, Aditya says, consumers are not very knowledgeable about cheese yet, but this is changing. “The most popular kinds of cheeses here remain gouda and cheddar, and fresh cheese such as mozzarella and feta. However, people are slowly starting to open up to various other kinds of cheeses now.”

Aditya will be at Foodhall, 1MG Mall, on Sunday from 12 noon to 2pm, to take guests through platters of various cheeses and how best to pair them and with what.","Experimenting with making cheese, bread, beer and curing meat at home as hobbies, Aditya, who was a postdoctoral fellow in Canada, quit this and worked on cheese farms.

"Now, healthy and storable ‘solar dried food’",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/21/now-healthy-and-storable-solar-dried-food-1790597.html,"Friday, March 23, 2018 07:07 AM +0530","HYDERABAD: For those who love their food to be local, health and inexpensive, there is a new concept of solar dried food. The All India Women’s Conference (AIWC) was on a mission to promote the usage of these solar dried products in homes at an event at Hotel Baseraa in Secunderabad recently. AIWC joined hands with Ohris Group of Restaurants to prepare different dishes using their Solar Dried food products, such as Solar Dried pasta, Solar Dried Tomatoes, onions, bhindi, methi leaves, Palak etc. Chef Amey, Chef Amar and Chef Archit took the lead in helping the guests understand the concept and the making.

The programme was attended by women from various NGOs that are partner organizations of AIWC in the City. Sunita Bhagwat, Commissioner, Tourism, Telangana state, was the guest of the day. Three other organizations displayed their Solar dried foods, and two experts Dr Bamji Mahtab, Retd NIN officer and Nutrition scientist and Dr Srinivas Chakravarthy, Physicist who manufactures solar driers, spoke about the promotion of Solar Dried products in the market. Supriya Bhalerao, Secretary of AIWC conceived the idea and executed it. The President Farida Hussain and other committee members explained the need for such products.

“Usage of Solar Energy in general, has become the necessity for the countries of the World. A lot of effort is going into generating power using solar energy. Women can use solar cookers and driers for cooking.They can dry vegetable and fruits, also different foods, in solar driers on a small or a big scale. They are dried in a scientific and hygienic manner to store in homes. The purpose is to have it available in our kitchen in an emergency, or in off-season, or for quick cooking,” they elaborated.

Drying in these gadgets not only preserves the nutrients in food, but also restores the flavour and its taste. Thus, as compared to the food that is dried directly under the sun on the terrace, solar dried food is more hygienic, dust free and tastier, the session concluded. These products can be soaked in warm water for 30 minutes to rehydrate and put to use for making various dishes.

AIWC, a 90-year-old organisation working for the upliftment of the women and children, having its head office in New Delhi, trains women in solar drying, helps them make the products and market them. Currently, no grocery stores stock solar dried products and there is a need for more women to come forward, get trained and start this as a business that has future.

All participants concurred with this and showed willingness to do whatever is required for the promotion of Solar Drying. It was also agreed upon that the representatives of different organisations will come together and form a group which will work towards the objective of producing popularising the solar dried products.

The branch in Hyderabad runs a Working Women’s hostel for the women from AP and Telangana and a free primary school for the children of the under-privileged parents. The centre has a vocational training centre, a low-cost sanitary napkin production unit in Chevella and a solar dried product unit in Hyderabad.","HYDERABAD: For those who love their food to be local, health and inexpensive, there is a new concept of solar dried food.

Just like grandma’s home,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/21/just-like-grandmas-home-1790546.html,"Friday, March 23, 2018 07:03 AM +0530","CHENNAI: I gently step down the grand spiral staircase, staring at the golden velakku chandelier plunging down the spiral chasm. Of the many centrepieces, this one is a stunner. For the past half-hour, we’ve been treated to a walking tour of a 50-year-old bungalow in T Nagar, now revamped into a pure vegetarian traditional restaurant, Paati Veedu.

True to its name, the charming three-storey building feels just like the warm embrace of a grandmother’s home, complete with old photographs of Madras to a palaanguzhi game set out in the thinnai, next to the wooden armchairs.

Dining area of Bhakshanam

“This is an experiential restaurant, where one can sit for two hours, enjoy a large five-course traditional meal with family and friends, and feel like they’ve gone back in time,” says Agnelo Vijayan, one of the partners behind the project.

Paati Veedu was conceptualised by Dubai-based Sirish Ramkumar, his brother-in-law G Mohandas, Agnelo, and a large bunch of friends and family who took care of different parts of the project. “We always wanted to do a huge 14-ground project complete with a traditional arts village. Now, we have started with just the restaurant phase of it,” says Agnelo.

They identified this old bungalow a year ago, and structurally and aesthetically redesigned it. “It used to be a ground-floor only house, which they kept expanding, so it’s a little maze-like and easy to get lost in, on your first walk,”Agnelo laughs.

But who wouldn’t mind getting lost in this maze of traditional carved wooden doors, Karaikudi stone pillars, antique radio sets and delightful kolams on red oxide walls?

As we speak, a waiter brings a shot glass of paanagham, a traditional refreshment drink, and we’re introduced to Sangeetha Mohandas, who curated the menu. “The restaurant was conceptualised around the menu because the founders wanted to bring back age-old recipes,” she says. Sourcing menus from all their friends’ and their families’ grandmothers, the kitchen team worked on creating the best combinations, over nine months. “For example, mor kozahmbu with paruppu usli and keerai is a great combination,” Sangeetha says. The menu has five types of sambhar; five types of kozhambu such as vatha kozahmbu, milaghu kozhambu, bonda potta mor kozhambu; rasams like pepper rasam, nellika rasam, murungakka rasam. You can sample these varieties in the ‘Poorna bhakshana’ meal, with 27 items, and the ‘Maharaja bhakshana’ with 35 dishes.

For those who prefer a la carte, try out the ‘Paati’s Thattu’, a pre-plated combination of dishes. “It has steamed rice, a choice of a sambhar, rasam or kozhambu, with a vegetable kootu, a steam-cooked and garnished poriyal and one type of kezhangu fry,” she says. There are also starters and desserts like elaneer payasasm, filter coffee mousse, karupatti halwa, carrot kesari... the mouth-watering list goes on.

“All those who have tasted our food so far say the same thing — that it is just like authentic home-cooked food. And that’s exactly what we’re striving for,” Sangeetha says.

Paati Veedu has three divisions

● Bhakshana, the fine-dining restaurant. The ground floor has seating, the first floor has private-dining, a live-kitchen and outdoor balcony-seating

● Decoction, outdoor shaded cafe

● Bhakshanam, a sweet and savouries shop

Master of spices,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/21/master-of-spices-1790586.html,"Friday, March 23, 2018 07:03 AM +0530","CHENNAI: I have been extremely passionate about food and cooking since my childhood. I would always watch my mother cook. I learnt from her that cooking is also an art. So I decided to pursue my passion as my career and in 2003 I was appointed as a South Indian chef at a popular hotel. I have worked in a couple of places including Malaysia, Hyderabad and Chennai.

There are are lot of cuisines in South India and I cook them all. But, my specialities are Chettinad and Andhra cuisine. Although they might seem similar, there are a lot of differences between them — be it in terms of the ingredients used or the flavours. Both these cuisines are spicy and make use of lot of dry spices. But the way they are used to give flavour to the dish is entirely different. For instance in Chettinad cuisine, traditional spices like black stone flower, peppercorns, are used, whereas in Andhra cuisine hot spices like Guntur chilli, garlic, are used.

Another difference is that in Andhra cuisine, we use a lot of salt and there are many varieties of pickles and chutneys. Most of the Southern cuisines follow a similar cooking method. The difference comes in the intensity of the spices used or the substitutes each one uses to give a different flavour. For instance, in Kerala cuisine, we primarily use coconut oil as the base, whereas in Chettinad it is mostly gingelly oil and in Andhra cuisine we use refined oil only.

Rice is a staple food in all the Southern States is something we all know. However, the kind of rice that is used differs in each State — for Chettinad cuisine we use jeeraga samba rice, for Andhra cuisine we use ponni raw rice. Event the meat used differs in each State. So these little elements define South Indian cuisine. During my stay in Malaysia I realised that most people there prefer our cuisine and they love our spices a lot. So it was indeed a pleasure to cook for them.

In Malaysian cuisine they don’t use rich spices like we do. They use a lot of lemon grass. So our dishes seemed something new. I was particular not to tamper with the authenticity of my dishes. I don’t like to play around with the flavours. I want to learn and specialise in Arabic cuisine, as that’s also rich in spices.

Anuradha Krishnamoorthy and

Namrata Sundaresan

As we walk towards a group of women, who are meticulously working, Ramya, (25) a BCom graduate, is busy cutting a fresh batch of feta. “I love everything about cheese making and I have learnt to do everything! It’s such an enjoyable process,” she says using sign language, as her co-worker translates it for us.

Ramya is among the many women with disabilities, who manage the unit at Kase, a social enterprise, founded by Anuradha Krishnamoorthy and Namrata Sundaresan. The duo was recently awarded the Nari Shakti Puraskar 2017 for providing livelihood to women with disabilities and empowering them. “We initially thought that the call was a scam. It was only after an official mail that we convinced ourselves that this was real,” says Anuradha. “We met so many women with such inspiring stories and it’s a memory we will cherish forever,” shares Namrata.

Ramya moves to a table across the room and begins cooking the mozzarella. “A positive work atmosphere is important, and we are happy that we are able to provide these women just that — learning skills on-the-go and lots of cheese, of course!” says Anuradha, founder, CAN DO, a BPO that focuses on training individuals with disabilities and employing them.

When Anuradha was thinking of how to train women, Namrata, her best friend and now business partner stepped in. Namrata recalls, “During a brief stay in Coonoor, I learnt to make basic varieties of cheese like feta, mozzarella, and halloumi. When Anuradha discussed her idea with me, I thought why not teach them to make cheese?” That’s how the plan began and it was fuelled when they received a call from Karen Anand, to be part of her first Farmer’s Market in Chennai.

Kase, meaning cheese in German, took shape in 2016. They have over 20 varieties of cheese which are infused with lip-smacking flavours including mustard, chilli, mango and cumin seed, thyme and whatnot!

I had my inhibitions when Namrata told us about their famous pickled feta cheese and molaga-podi rubbed cheddar. But, a tasting was all it took to convince us about the versatility of the good ol’ cheese. “There’s a lack of awareness about artisanal cheese in the city. It’s one of the richest sources of proteins and is made from pure milk, sourced from farms in and around Chennai,” share the duo.

Fresh cheese varieties, spice rubs, dips and work module makes Kase different from others, but their USP is their effort in enabling the differently-abled with a skill as novel as cheese making. “Everyone has a designated job and they enjoy doing it. Some have disabilities that the society acknowledges while some have a stigma attached to it. We want their work to be noticed, rather than their disability,” asserts Anuradha.

A typical day at Kase starts at 11 am where eight cheese makers start production. “We usually wrap up production by 3 pm, as cheese needs to be made at a certain temperature. Our work unit is always busy...but never chaotic,” she shares. The idea is to not have these women spend their whole life in the cheese making unit. They are open to the women starting their own enterprise too.

It’s almost closing time and as they begin to cloth bind the cheese for aging and stack it inside the refrigerator, Anuradha tells us their future plans. “It’s not about expansion. Our vision is different. We are exploring partnerships with rural NGOs where we can set small cooperatives. Since dairy is an integral part of the rural economy, a simple basic training in cheese making will be an added value to what they can give to their society. It’s about bringing about a change,” she says.

Leading by example

“To touch and transform the life of so many people, adds a new meaning to life every day,” says Sheela Balaji, chairperson and managing trustee, AIM for Seva and Swami Dayananda Educational Trust. The social worker was another Chennaiite who received the Nari Shakti Puraskar 2017 for her contribution towards women’s empowerment, rural education and reviving traditional grains.

“It is the highest civilian award for women, and I was surprised. But, now it seems extremely fulfilling,” she shares. Since 2001 she has been actively working to create opportunities for people from disadvantaged communities. “I believe that each of us who have got the talent, and resource, need to focus it on helping and creating a better environment for others,” she asserts. Sheela, the brain behind Spirits of Earth adds, “This award not only validates the work done by women in different fields but also inspires other women to find their identity. I hope they do.”","“I love everything about cheese making and I have learnt to do everything!

The culinary flavours of Telangana's Ugadi festival,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/16/the-culinary-flavours-of-telanganas-ugadi-festival-1788289.html,"Saturday, March 17, 2018 02:52 PM +0530","HYDERABAD : Like few other states of southern and western India, the first day of the month of Chaitra brings the New Year in Telangana. The day is celebrated as the Ugadi festival. The word is derived from yuga (era) and aadi (beginning) in Sanskrit, which loosely translates as the beginning of a new period. Apart from visiting temples to seek divine blessings, giving gifts and decorating the entrances of the houses with floral designs or rangoli and fresh mango leaves on this auspicious day, the locals also indulge in some special food specifically prepared for the occasion.

The Ugadi Pachadi is the most important dish of the festival, a preparation signifying ‘Shadruchulu’ or all the six tastes – sweet, sour, salty, bitter, hot as well as tangy. It serves as a reminder to the people that life has all kinds of experiences ranging from sweet to bitter. Some of the ingredients of the pachadi are tamarind, jaggery, margosa flowers and leaves, chillies, salt and raw mango. In some homes, the preparation is more liquid, while some prepare it like a thicker chutney. The dish also has medicinal values

and works as a coolant, and is said to prepare you for the ensuing hot summer.

Apart from the pachadi, few other delicacies are also specially made for the festival. Mamidikaya Pulihora or raw mango rice is a seasonal preparation, as green mangos start being available during this time of the year. Many people even follow a custom of not eating mangoes before Ugadi, and thus this is the day when they are tasting mangoes from the new season for the first time. For them, this rice preparation with grated or chopped mangos, chana dal, peanuts and green chillies with a hint of asafoetida is perhaps the first mango preparation to be enjoyed during the season.

Bobbatlu or bakshalu is a sweet which is made during the New Year not just in Telangana, but in neighbouring Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka. Going by various names such as puran poli, polelu or holige, it essentially a sweet paratha made of flour-based dough and stuffed with a filling of chickpea flour and jaggery, which is prepared in ghee on a tawa. In variations to recipe, moong dal, khowa or sugar are used.

Apart from the three dishes above, families generally get together for a sumptuous meal to celebrate the festive spirit. Desserts like Poornam Boorelu, Kajjikayalu, and Semiya Payasam as well as pachadis of various types are much in demand. Try these restaurants for Ugadi special food:

Traditionally Modern,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/17/traditionally-modern-1787724.html,"Saturday, March 17, 2018 01:01 PM +0530","It is holiday time, and Goa-bound tourist vehicles turn off the Pune-Belgaum Highway for lunch at Padma Hotel in Tarabai area of Kolhapur in Maharashtra. Set on a terrace with a view of the gardens that the Ingle family owns, here travellers can tuck into a thali, comprising well-spiced tender mutton dishes, bakhri (similar to roti) and rice, with a choice of two distinctive Kolhapuri soups—the reddish Tambada Rassa and the milder Pandhara Rassa between morsels. Generations ago the Ingle family brought traditional Kolhapuri fare to the public at Padma Guest House. Today, the great grandsons of the founder, Col Nanasaheb Dattajirao Ingle, are looking to take the cuisine to other cities. In February, they had set up a pop-up at Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai, for the Magnetic Maharashtra Conference.

Gauri Ingle, who manages both properties, says: “Col Ingle, who was Military Secretary to the Maharaja of Kolhapur, founded Padma Talkies in 1941 and Padma Guest House in 1947. These were named after Princess Padmaraje. In the 1950s, Padma Guest House started to serve Kolhapuri food—a curated combination of Kolhapur’s most famous main and side dishes, which is now available in other restaurants as the Kolhapuri Thali. At that time, my father-in-law, Dhairyasheelrao Ingle, took over his father’s work, and now our sons are taking their legacy forward.”

In August 2001, Gauri and Ruturaj Ingle decided to start a branch of the eatery in the Tarabai Park area. “As the city grew, Tarabai Park became an upmarket neighbourhood with an affluent population that wanted a quiet family dining experience. Since this area is not far from the highway, it is an ideal place for tourists to taste a full-fledged Kolhapuri meal,’’ says Gauri. The thalis—Rassa Mutton, Rakti Mundi, Veg Special, Chicken and Mutton thalis—are a big hit. “Mutton Lonche, made from pickled dry mutton, is one of our signature creations. Many visitors order Mutton Lonche and Veg Vindaloo takeaways,” she says.

The tagline of the Padma restaurants is “Proudly Traditional”. The Padma Guest House has retained its old world charm with decades old ceiling fans, furniture, fixtures and window fittings, with walls festooned with photographs of Kolhapur Princely State. On the other hand, Padma restaurant is trendy. “There are many old-timers who still go to Padma Guest House, even though Padma Hotel has the same menu,” says Gauri.

To add variety to the repertoire, Gauri, who is from Gwalior, has added the Gwalior-style Puran Poli Thali to the menu of their restaurants. “My sons, Aaryamaan and Shatrunjai, have studied hospitality management from Lavasa, Pune. They have started Epicure Catering that offers on-site catering of royal cuisines of Kolhapur, Baroda, Gwalior and other Maratha princely states, as well as national and international cuisines,” says Gauri. The Ingles are also organising Kolhapuri food festivals in other cities.

Aaryaman Ingle is optimistic about the future. “We are planning to start Padma Restaurant in Pune, followed by another in Mumbai. In addition to these, we will organise pop-ups to popularise Kolhapur’s traditional cuisine across India.” Yet another local culinary experience is slowly and surely going national.","Generations ago the Ingle family brought traditional Kolhapuri fare to the public at Padma Guest House.

Experts from the Japanese culinary industry, Yasushi Kawoshimo and Hirofumi Masaki, were flown in to teach the participants about the intricacies of Japanese cuisine.

The workshop kicked off with Masaki demonstrating the equipment required – knives chopsticks, cleavers – for a Japanese meal preparation. Although Japanese cuisine majorly consists of seafood and other meat, this workshop only used vegetarian ingredients as authentic Japanese ingredients are rare to find here. Later the duo went on to prepare Miso Soup, a slow cooked vegetable broth. Kawashimo said, “This is home food in Japan. This is what mothers make.”

After the participants got to taste the soup, next up was tempura. “Tempura looks easy but is very difficult as the temperature has to be maintained at 180 degrees,” said Kawashimo promptly dipping the tip of his finger into the hot oil evoking gasps. “I have an iron finger to test the temperature but others can check by seeing how deep the batter dips when dropped in the oil,” he calmly said. As the tempura was passed around for the students who were then invited to the cooking table to try their hand at it, Masaki started teaching how to prepare Onigiri sushi, rice moulded into a triangle shape wrapped in nori, seaweed paper. Before dispersing for lunch, the students present took chances to learn sushi skills art first hand from the international chefs, who were more than happy to indulge them.

Calcutta Biryani for Hyderabadi Taste Buds,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/09/calcutta-biryani-for-hyderabadi-taste-buds-1784653.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 08:58 AM +0530","HYDERABAD: It was 1856 when the last Nawab of Oudh, Wajid Ali Shah lost his kingdom to the British. The Nawab was exiled to Metiabruz, a suburb in the British capital city of Calcutta where he came with his huge entourage and set up his residence. Among them were his khansamas and rakabdars who had to cook his favourite Awadhi Biryani for the members of this team. However, the financial situation of the Nawab did not permit maintaining the same meat ratio in the dish. Meat was expensive and the bawarchis replaced them with potatoes to bring down the cost.

Though fund constraints seem to have been the reason for the inclusion of potato in the Nawab’s biryani, another story talks about that potatoes at that time were sought-after vegetables added just to bring a variation to the recipe. The variant was appreciated and thus was born a new version of biryani known as Calcutta Biryani in which the rice and the meat are cooked partially, and the potatoes are fried, before the biryani is layered in a handi, and put on dum. The moist biryani relies more on the flavour and has vless masala as compared to its Hyderabadi counterpart. It is light on the stomach usually enjoyed with sides such as chaap or pasanda. Saffron, kewra water, and mitha attar are some of ingredients used for its typical fragrance.

Over the centuries, the dish became popular in Kolkata and around, with many versions seen in popular Kolkata eateries like Royal Indian, Shiraz, Arsalan, and Aminia with differentiation, for example, Royal Indian Restaurant still serves biryani without the omnipresent potato, whereas Aminia has a version which has a taste closer to the Awadhi counterpart.

In Hyderabad, Call of Bengal at Gachibowli has been offering authentic Calcutta biryani for the past few years the place is owned by Sumita Ganguli, a culinary expert. They have hired a trained chef from Kolkata to prepare this biryani. Other than mutton and chicken biryani, they also offer vegetarian and egg versions of the dish.

IT professionals form their loyal clientele for this dish while at the same time the locals initially had inhibitions about the lack of spiciness in the biryani. But over a period of time, the Hyderabadis have begun to fall in love for the dish for its unique flavour and aroma. The restaurant will soon be shifting to a bigger location. Other than this, Kolkata House in Hafeezpet and Bengal Zone in Miyapur are other eateries that offer Calcutta biryani on their menu.

Why does even an ordinary tea taste so special when you are on a long drive? It’s the outdoor factor, of course. Bringing in ‘The Great Outdoors’ factor into the indoors is what Marriott Hyderabad is doing now.

The hotel on the banks of Hussian Sagar decided to find out the delicacies that taste even more delicious when cooked outdoors and is recreating the same taste in the kitchens of Okra.

Chef Aungshuman Chakraborty and his team gave Hyderabadis a sign of things to come when they hosted an outdoor dining event in February in a beautiful farm at Hasthalpur in Medak district, a two-hour drive from Hyderabad. The hotel constructed makeshift charcoal pits, roast pits, sand pits, spit roasts and good old chulhas in the farm and the food indeed tasted delicious. “I studied the techniques of rustic cooking and now am attempting to try this out for the city folk. So expect slow rustic cooking, made lovingly in our urban kitchens,” he promises.

Although it is not feasible to rebuild those very stoves inside, the chef has adapted the cooking techniques in this Sunday poolside brunch. In the coming few weeks, the restaurant will also give interesting variations of regular food to bring more novelty. Don’t be surprised if your appam comes with egg roast instead of a stew. “Each week will be a new delight and an innovation,” promises chef Aungshuman. Sundays look like Fundays now.","Bringing in ‘The Great Outdoors’ factor into the indoors is what Marriott Hyderabad is doing now.

As the name suggests, they have eggs in everything, from small eats to main course and even

desserts. The menu has been extended by including egg-y dishes from all over the world. You can start your meal on a sweet note with Kaya Brioche. It is said to be a hangover cure in Singapore. The garlic bread is served with a spread of jam-like kaya that is prepared with coconut and eggs. It is a perfect blend of the delicate nutty flavour of garlic and a sweet tinge of kaya. This could be addictive.

The Tex Mex Migas has tortilla topped with scrambled egg and shredded cheese. High on tomatoes and also some coriander leaves, the Tex Mex is crispy and tangy. The TEF Pita Pockets is one of the specialities of The Egg Factory. As you take a bite of the pita pocket, the egg yolk oozes out from the fried egg inside the pocket. Apart from fried egg, it has broccoli, zucchini and carrots in it. Most of the dishes that they have on the menu has broccoli and zucchini.

The Burmese Rice Bowl has flavourful rice that comes along with creamy egg curry prepared with coconut milk and veggies including lettuce, red capsicum, zucchini and broccoli. The many-coloured veggies set against the orange makes this dish bright and appealing. Anda Ghotala is a popular street food in Surat. Ghotala in Hindi means mess, and the dish captures it with its fried eggs, scrambled eggs and boiled eggs. Served with pav, this can be an instant-breakfast saviour.

Have you heard about egg in kheer? It is surprising and so is its taste. The Andey ka Kheer is a specialty from Hyderabad. It is served usually as a dessert at the weddings. The thick cream and sugar seem to overpower the taste of egg white. The kheer is made with vermicelli and is served in a jar.

If you are looking for an egg-y dessert, you can try the cheesecake. This is the best cheesecakes I have ever had. It is moist and egg-y. The base is also soft. It reminds you of the batter you lick while baking a cake.

For an eggetarian, this place with the interior walls painted in white and yellow is like heaven. But, you may also like to try out some cold-pressed juices such as the Chlorophyll Fix, a minty dark green colour drink, as a refreshing cooler. Since eggs do tend to produce heat, eating too many of them can lead to discomfort. This drink helps. Cost for two: `650","BENGALURU: Egg is the most versatile ingredient proves The Egg Factory with its variety of dishes with eggs.
The menu has been extended by including egg-y dishes from all over the world.
As you take a bite of the pita pocket, the egg yolk oozes out from the fried egg inside the pocket.

This limited edition menu by Bar Bar, called Drunken BBQ, has 11 dishes that have each been infused with a different kind of alcohol. With options in veg and non-veg, there's something on this menu for everyone. We started the meal with a vegetarian option – Loaded Nachos with Chilli Infused Tequila.

Though the alcohol taste is not very evident, which makes you wonder where exactly it is, the nachos themselves were well-flavoured with plenty of cheese and gaucamole. Next, we tried the Gin and Lemon Chicken Wings – a great starter option for non-vegetarians – which packs quite a punch when it comes to flavour. We also sampled the Tequila Amritsari Prawns, and found that though the prawns were fresh and cooked right, the batter was a little thick and undercooked.

For mains, we tried two dishes. Under the veg section, we tried the Bourbon Barbecued Cottage Cheese Brochettes. The dish came with grilled vegetables and couscous as sides, and was enjoyable overall, mainly because of the bourbon sauce. The Beef Tenderloin with Whiskey Cream Sauce was next, and it was served with grilled vegetables and a mushroom risotto. While the dish was good flavour-wise, the beef could've leaned more towards the medium-rare side, and risotto could've been less sticky.

When paired with their signature cocktails and great deals on liquor, this menu is a good option after shopping at Phoenix Mall.

Chai chronicles on Chennai roads,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/09/chai-chronicles-on-chennai-roads-1784620.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 08:54 AM +0530","CHENNAI:At 4.30 pm on Women’s Day, passersby on the street leading to Kapaleeshwara temple, Mylapore, were drawn to the aroma of ayurvedic tea brewed at a stall near Gandhi statue. Vendors from shops around the area, women on their way to the market, and girls returning after school, stopped for a sip of Uppma Virdi’s ‘golden chai’. It was a 11-spice special blend, a recipe passed onto Uppma by her grandfather.

Uppma is 26, and an ex-commercial lawyer based in Australia. She quit her job to turn her passion of recreating remedial chai blends into a business. In a year, her humble cup of chai grew into ‘Chai Walli’ — a brand that received many accolades including ‘Best Chai’ at Royal Hobbart Fine Food Awards in 2017, and she was a finalist at Australian Food and Beverage Health Food Awards. Getting here was an uphill task, she shares. “Everyone would ask what was a lawyer doing, making chai. My parents too had their concerns, but now they see how happy I am. So they’ve been helping with the business too.”

Most Indian homes smell of chai, and Uppma believes it has a unique way of bringing people together. During her stay in Austria for education, where temperatures were as low as 21 degrees, making her own blend of chai helped keep her warm and connect with people in a new city. “We were all students from different nationalities who missed home. I used to make my grandfather’s chai for all of us, and we formed a special bond over it,” she shares.

When she moved back to Australia, the basement of her home became a warehouse to brew different blends of tea. It was stocked with black tea leaves bought from farms in India. And her free time was spent drying and grinding fennel, cardamom, cloves, elaichi, and other spices with her mother’s mortar and pestle. “We slowly started selling it, and people came back for more. That was a good sign. So, I turned it into a business, and also conducted workshops on the art of making tea.”

One thing led to another, and today, ‘Chai Walli’ is a company she runs single-handedly. She shares that it’s more than enough to keep her content, and sustain her financially. At present, Uppma imports tea and spices from organic farms in Assam. She is looking to connect with and support other organic farmers across the country too.

The perfect chai

● Make sure your milk is fresh and unhomogenised. Avoid milk that is spun.

● Buy unadulterated black tea.

● Add tulsi and saffron to make your tea refreshing.

● Get the proportion of spices right. Use cardamom sparingly, and more of fennel.

● Don’t add too much ginger to your tea. It can add to the heat in your body, especially if you’re from a hot place. Cut, dried ginger is best.

Nizami cuisine: A royal affair,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/10/nizami-cuisine-a-royal-affair-1784623.html,"Saturday, March 10, 2018 08:53 AM +0530","CHENNAI: During my childhood days, whenever my mother prepared kathal ki tikka, the aroma would lure me into the kitchen. I would watch her carefully drop the tikkas into the oil. She inspired me to cook. My uncle and brothers are chefs, too. At some point in my childhood, I started spending a lot of time in the kitchen, experimenting with different ingredients. When I turned 17, I moved out to work. The first dish I made was murgh malai in 1996. I served it to my general manager and he loved it. Feedback always motivates us to cook. Twenty two years later, I have now travelled to several parts of the country including Bengaluru, Chennai, Kuwait and Qatar.

I cook different cuisines, my expertise lies in Nizami cuisine. The speciality about my cooking is that I try and include as many homemade and natural ingredients as possible. I am quite health conscious and so I ensure that what I cook is healthy too. I make it a point to give my customers a satisfactory meal and not a bad stomach (laughs). I am very particular about the flavours and ingredients I use, and most of all, sticking to my roots.

When it comes to Indian cuisine, people often perceive that all cuisines in India are the same. Yes, they may have many similarities in terms of ingredients, but there are a lot of differences when it comes to the flavours and also the method of cooking — like more or less use of oil and/or ghee.

Nizami cuisine is not very spicy, but it is definitely rich in terms of flavours. We have a huge variety of kebabs, naans and even chutneys. Some of the commonly seen ingredients are cashew (mostly in the paste form), spices such as patthar ke phool. And it depends on the dish as well, some are sour while others are creamier. So the amount of the ingredients put into it changes accordingly. And for non-vegetarian dishes, we use chicken, mutton and fish.

I would love to explore and try my hand at more south Indian food. I felt that the food in Karnataka is influenced by the flavours of the north. I tried the local Tamilian food after coming down to Chennai. I loved the thali and fish. I want to do some fusion later on.

Here's why children in India now prefer Coca-Cola over lassi,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/08/heres-why-children-in-india-now-prefer-coca-cola-over-lassi-1783896.html,"Friday, March 9, 2018 10:13 AM +0530","NEW YORK: If your children have started preferring junk snacks over traditional home-cooked food, blame it on powerful marketing strategies of multinational corporations that sell processed foods with low nutrition value, says a study.

In the study, published in the Journal of Children and Media, the researchers investigated the links between marketing and media exposure and the preference for international foods and beverages among children in India, Pakistan, Brazil, China, Nigeria and Russia.

The kids who easily identified the logos of international food and beverage brands such as McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Coca-Cola, were more likely to request and prefer the processed foods marketed by these international corporations, the findings showed.

""Our findings draw attention to the insidious and pervasive nature of marketing and how it impacts children's health,"" said principal investigator of the study Dina Borzekowski from the University of Maryland in the US.

""Why would a five year old say that they want a Coca Cola over a lassi? Kentucky Fried Chicken over a stir-fried chicken and vegetable dish made by mom?"" Borzekowski said.

For this study, Borzekowski and colleagues gathered information from 2,422 children between age 5 and 6 years from India, Brazil, China, Nigeria, Pakistan and Russia.

The participants were shown pictures of media characters (both internationally and locally popular ones) and they were asked to identify those pictures and characters.

The researchers found that three-fourths could name Tom and Jerry and two-thirds could name Mickey Mouse.

They also did a matching activity, where children were shown cards with different logos and asked to match each card with the item it might represent.

Overall, about 60 per cent were able to associate the Coca-Cola swirl with an image of a soda glass.

To assess food preferences, the research team showed children two similar products -- one international and one domestic -- and asked which product they would want.

They also had children rate how much they desired a variety of domestic and international products.

Character and logo recognition in young children was consistently and significantly related to the selection of international over domestic and local food and beverage options.

The influence of logo recognition was even stronger than that of media exposure, the study found.

The researchers believe that understanding the reach of global and international marketing and its impact on food preferences could help inform public health approaches to reverse trends of growing childhood obesity.","In the study, published in the Journal of Children and Media, the researchers investigated the links between marketing and media exposure and the preference for international foods and beverages among children in India, Pakistan, Brazil, China, Nigeria and Russia.

Breaking the glass ceiling from the kitchen,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/08/breaking-the-glass-ceiling-from-the-kitchen-1783649.html,"Thursday, March 8, 2018 11:10 AM +0530","HYDERABAD: Mard khaana banaye tho kala hai. Aurat banaye tho farz hai” chides Sridevi in the film English Vinglish. It loosely translates to “If a man cooks it’s an art and when a woman does, it’s her responsibility.” Shivani Verma, the chef and owner of Granny’s Art Cafe in her own way challenged this cliche. “We all grow up with the conditioning that the women of the house cook and if and when the men cook, it’s a reason to celebrate,” says Shivani who grew up eating her grandmother and her mom’s food.

Love conquers hate

A heartfelt story and a very specific incident is what made her turn cooking into a livelihood despite hating it earlier. “To be honest, I never liked cooking. I never even went into the kitchen before,” narrates the 33-year old who now runs the kitchen at Granny’s Art Cafe. “My grandmother on the other hand loved cooking and sought happiness in feeding us. And oshe cooked like a dream! When she passed, I started to miss her and the food she cooked so I started experimenting in the kitchen. One day my father ate what I cooked and said, ‘You cook like your grandmother’. And that’s when I decided to dedicate a restaurant to her memory,” she says.

More than a business

“It’s probably in a woman’s nature to be nurturing,” she says thoughtfully. “It’s never been just a business for us. We have people who have been coming in for a meal everyday since a year. We get requests off the menu too. Even the interiors are what we made ourself and designed,” she chimes. And when her customers praise her food, she feels just a little more closer to her dear grandmother she admits.

It’s still a man’s world

Although Shivani has seen the ups and downs of the business, and has been managing her business with her own intellect and strength now, she admits that in the real world it can be scary. “I was a reserved person before I started the business but the job has taught me to be more assertive,” she says adding, “It’s a problem to get employees, vendors and chefs to take me seriously. They have a condescending tone and an demeaning attitude towards a woman in charge.

I as a reserved person was scared out of my wits because of this. But as time progressed I realised that this is how it’s going to be and that I have to make my stand and be strong.” Shivani wants to send out the message to all the women trying to make their mark in a man’s world: “Don’t be afraid. People will drag you down and make you doubt your capability just because you are a woman. But believe in yourself and don’t let them get to you.”

Previously a security guard at an apartment, she joined Howard Johnson, a four-star hotel in Hebbal. She worked as a kitchen stewardess for three years before becoming a professional pastry chef for the last eight months.

“I was fascinated with wearing a chef’s hat, and wanted to do more challenging work than kitchen

stewarding,” she says on how she ended up in the baking industry. She found the baking department in the hotel a very interesting place to be, and began learning the art during her off-duty hours. “Baking is a more challenging job, what we create is consumed by guests and appreciated. I wanted to showcase my creativity and prove myself.”

Sandhya found it challenging to do both, especially since her normal working hours were from 7am to 4pm. “Between 4.30pm and 8.30pm, I learnt baking. So totally, I used to spend about 13-14 hours a day at work. As I stay nearby, I could walk in on off days too to learn.” Within seven months of training, she mastered the art of baking.Although there was no time to spend with her family, Sandhya says that this sacrifice was in order to ensure her children’s dreams could be achieved. “I have struggled financially, like everyone else. I have to pay fees for my children, pay rent and run my house. Life is ‘swalpa sihi,

swalpa kahi’ (little sweet, little sour), like we say in Kannada, and I work very hard to make it easier for my family.”

Yes, you read it right and it tastes like hazelnut-chocolate spread. Tongues wagging??

The company has come up with this unimaginable ghee by mixing cacao, from which chocolate is made, with coconut sugar to sweeten it and then combining it with date syrup and company's own Madagascar Vanilla Bean Ghee.

Interestingly, the company has named its new line of ghee flavours as 'Chocti', which is Sanskrit word for change and empowerment.

Don't know about empowerment, but yes, it is a nice and healthy change (read replacement) over Nutella, which was mired in controversy last year over allegedly having a cancer-causing ingredient.

These steamed delights are none other than the famous Ramassery idlis. According to Annamalai K, co-owner of Bhagyalakshmi Amma’s, this is the first time they are selling these idlis in Kochi. “The response is overwhelming and people seem to have fallen in love with our specially made idlis,” says Annamalai.

The original shop is located at Ramassery, about 10 km from Palakkad. Annamalai said people of the Mudaliyar community make these idlis. “The recipe is passed down through generations. The distinct style of making and serving makes our idlis unique,” he said. Annamalai is a relative of Bhagyalakshmi who runs the Ramassery idli shop in Palakkad. Her daughter Smitha and other family members have come down to the city to make and serve this special dish.

The Ramassery idli, unlike the normal one, is steamed in a pot. The idlis are also big in size. Annamalai said though it has the shape of dosa, it tastes entirely different and is also rich in nutrients. He said, “In our village, we use wood-fired chulhas to cook the idlis. But since it is not possible to arrange one here, we have to use a gas stove. Hence, the right flavour isn’t achieved.” The idlis are made by placing a thin cotton cloth on the mouth of the pot. The batter is poured in a thin layer on the cloth and steamed for a few seconds. Up to three idlis can be made at the same time using this technique, he added.

Annamalai said, “People from across the state visit our shop back in Palakkad.” The idlis are being sold at Rs 20 per piece along with coconut and chilly chutney. Chammanthi podi too is provided. These chutneys too are unique. Annamalai said a majority of our customers are families.

‘Street chefs’ serve up delicious stories,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/05/street-chefs-serve-up-delicious-stories-1782514.html,"Tuesday, March 6, 2018 07:33 AM +0530","BENGALURU:Streets are better for yummy food vendors serve, but we rarely ‘see’ the person behind the cart. Our interactions are usually transactional. To change this, a city-based theatre company Visual Aspiration is staging untold stories of the streetside chefs through their play Stand on the Street.

Director Aruna Ganesh Ram says, “I have always been interested in exploring theatre that caters to multi-sensorial work. Food is the most immersive experience because it continuously engages all senses”.Visual Aspiration, which staged the play on March 3 and 4 at Atta Galatta, plans to travel with it through the city and to other cities. Their next performance will be at Untitled Space in JP Nagar, this coming weekend.

To research for the play, the entire team went on a food trail to various cities from Chennai and Bengaluru to Varanasi, Patna and Delhi, conversing with 250 to 300 chefs along the way. “We collected bitter and sweet stories from their lives. Each and every street chef inspired us,” she says.There were challenges, from winning the confidence of the vendors to conversing despite language barriers. “There were time we got no response, and there were times conversations went on for two hours. We closely observed their body language, and built characters and narratives,” says Aditya Garg, one of the lead actors.

Stand up and eat

Stand on the Street has an interesting format. The audience stands through out the play, which has changing sets and a moving stage. The size of the audience is limited to 25 for a more intimate experience. “To recreate a typical street experience, we wanted our actors to interact with the audience better… the audience had to stand closer to the actors,” says Aruna. “The stage is divided into different sets, each for one kind of street food, and the audience keeps moving to follow the narrative.”

The best part is that, while enjoying the play, a viewer can munch on different foods -- from jhaal moori of Kolkata to sundal from Chennai and paan from Benaras, these are cooked/prepared to authentic recipes. The actors cook, with ingredients from the particular state, during the run of the play. The theatre group is aware of the social disparity between the performers and their subjects, and have taken extra measures to ensure that there is no ‘mockery’ of vendors. For one, actors perform wearing masks, which were moulded with the help of an artist based in Chennai.Aruna says, “With a mask, this character’s story can be everyone’s story. We are not here to mock life of vendors.”

Brother waits to go home

Bhola, a street food vendor in VV Puram, is from Varanasi. He misses home every day, but he stays back because he wants to finance his sisters’ marriages.“I have even packed my bags to return a few times, but I unpack because returning empty-handed is not an option,” says this vendor who sells chana choor masala, a popular delicacy of Uttar Pradesh. He has been here just a year and has tried hard to learn Kannada. “Over the last six years, I have travelled to six states. Indian streets have kept me alive,” he says. Bhola says that he bought a phone and a bike for himself and has a plan to own a house in his village.

Four decades selling avare bele masala

Eighty-year-old Natarajan has been running a streetside eatery, serving a variety of churmuri, for the past 48 years.This vendor on VV Puram’s food street runs the business with hi wife. He has one son and a daughter, both independently run their businesses. The children would rather that Natarajan rests at home, considering his age, but he wants to be financially independent. They have seen difficult days with no customers or days when police harass them to vacate or no enough money to even pay their rent. But, they have survived these and now have built a house near Lalbagh, and with their seasonal savings. The top-selling snack at his cart is Avare Bele Masala.

Hardwork beats odds

Stories the theatre group heard, interacting with street chefs, were inspiring. Aruna says that vendors spend long days on the road -- 4 am to midnight -- because they want to be financially independent irrespective of their age and gender. She shares a moving story: “I remember a woman who was selling chai in Domlur. She casually pointed to a spot on the road, saying that was where her husband died 28 years ago. She said that she didn’t have time to even mourn his death or feel bad because she had three children to feed, and she had to ensure that they get a good education.

Laying the table from the cloud,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/mar/03/laying-the-table-from-the-cloud-1780747.html,"Saturday, March 3, 2018 07:39 PM +0530","Enterprising foodpreneurs are combining a love for cuisine and technology to cater to the experimental palate of urban Indians, with both regular fare and exotic meals. A meal is no longer confined to small establishments and expensive fine dining restaurants, but also arrives at your doorsteps via smartphones.

Food tech start-ups across the country—from the big-ticket ones to the mid-sized and small ventures—are walking on a cloud to stay in business and beat the competition. Take Cloud kitchen, a new online restaurant genre without brick and mortar. Unlike a traditional restaurant that offers dine-in or takeaway facility, it only delivers food.

The dish of choice is just a click or a swipe away, quite literally, as orders are placed via websites or apps and in some cases with phonecalls. These cloud kitchens either have an online medium to take the orders or accept requests via food delivery start-ups such as Zomato, Swiggy, etc.

Hotel management graduate Arvind Chaudhary of Noida-based Backstreet Kitchen, a cloud-only food operation service that serves Indian, Chinese and Mughlai, started two years ago. He says, “Cloud kitchen only provides delivery service, so the focus remains on food, its preparation, quality and packaging. Technology plays a major role. This revenue model is gaining a foothold as it cuts costs, time, and works well for both the owner and customer.”

It has been noted that the number of dine-in customers has decreased significantly over the last few years, with customers mostly opting for home delivery. Many are now shutting down outlets or moving towards cloud kitchens to cut down on the cost and maximise returns.

Stiff competition in the restaurant industry, along with reducing margins, made restaurateur Ashish Parashar of Mumbai-based Litti Express partially move to cloud kitchen. He opened Litti Express, his first restaurant serving authentic food from North India in Oshiwara, Mumbai, but slowly moved

to the cloud model when he decided to start operations in Bandra.

“After running my outlet for a couple of years, I realised that the restaurant space is highly competitive. The high rentals in a city like Mumbai coupled with the rising cost of infrastructure and manpower management only add to our woes. Cloud kitchen seems like the smarter way to run my business,” says Parashar.

Cloud kitchen restaurants try to maximise the number of orders per day, by decreasing the production and packaging time, and managing the logistics. With menu options galore in cloud kitchens, there is always one to suit every palate. As Bela Gupta of Herbivore says, “The younger generation doesn’t want dal chawal every day. They earn well but sadly don’t have the time and energy to cook an elaborate spread. Places like us cater to that segment and give them the best possible eating experience, delivering food to our clients irrespective of their location, whether they are at home or at work. We have a

15-member team to handle a variety of dishes from a wide vegetarian menu, comprising global and regional cuisines. We also offer meal subscription plans and tailored catering.”

One of the pioneers is Faasos—available across 140 locations in 13 cities—and has been operating profitably for years. Taking a cue from this e-model, food delivery start-ups such as Zomato and Swiggy too have jumped on to the bandwagon.

Where there is success, there is specialisation. Bengaluru-based online gourmet food service company Chefkraft aims to address the need of the consumer for fresh, wholesome and flavourful food in high-quality packaging on demand. “We plan to cover all of Bengaluru in 2018 and at the same time, build an offline presence that augments the brand. We will continue to have a centralised model that allows us to go to market quickly, maintain quality standards and to operate costs while continuously pushing the bar on the service element,” says Mohit Mital of Chefkraft.

However, the cloud kitchen model is not a sure shot recipe for success in the food tech business, since there are potential pitfalls too. The founders of Delhi-based cloud kitchen player Yumist that shut its operations in September 2017 said in its company blog, “Cloud kitchens are here to stay. It’s probably the case that the first one through the door gets shot. The problem we were trying to solve is a big one, and we are certain someone will pick up from where we left. Our wishes and support are with them.” Summing up the concept of cloud kitchen, Chaudhary says with a chuckle, “I would not be impressed with technology until I can download food.”","These cloud kitchens either have an online medium to take the orders or accept requests via food delivery start-ups such as Zomato, Swiggy, etc.

Serving London original Indian fare,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/24/serving-london-original-indian-fare-1777484.html,"Saturday, February 24, 2018 07:58 PM +0530","As we started our conversation with Uttam Tripathy of Potli—an Indian restaurant in London—we were reminded of the film Cheeni Kum. Remember, how the movie starts off with the fiercely proud owner of an Indian restaurant, Amitabh Bachchan, boasting of his knowledge about Hyderabadi Zafrani Pulao? Uttam’s passion for serving authentic and impeccably-cooked Indian dishes to the westerners called for the comparison. In fact, The Week voted it as one of the 24 best Indian restaurants in London in 2017. The 40-year-old native of Odisha’s Sambalpur district is on a mission to popularise Indian market cuisine in the West.

Until 1995, Uttam had no clue about the hotel or food industry. It was luck by chance that he cleared his interview for an integrated course in Hotel Management at Kolkata’s Taratala to become a part of the Indian Institute of Hotel Management. As he puts it himself, ‘out of nowhere’ he was selected for the institute’s Chennai campus. And, that’s how he set on a voyage of good food. “No one had ever opted for hotel management in my family of engineers and professors. But, I have enjoyed being with people,” he says.

The restaurant and the staff members

Setting up Potli wasn’t an overnight affair. He faced a fair share of struggle before striking the right note. With memories of Sambalpur etched in his mind, he left for Delhi to realise his dreams. His associations with some of the reputed hotels in the national capital helped him learn the tricks of the trade. However, his insatiable hunger for entrepreneurship took him to London in 2004.

“I faced a tough time for more than a year, when I first came to London. People who brought me to the city didn’t keep their words. Soon, I had no job,” Uttam recollects. Fortunately, he bumped into a client, who hired him for launching a bar-cum-Indian restaurant in north-west London. He transformed a dying old English pub into a swanky yet traditional Indian bar, Blue Ginger.

“I wasn’t happy deep inside working for others. With nothing in hand, I quit my job in 2010. Along with a friend I was knocking on the doors of investors and banks to secure investment for my project. Everyone rejected us. Finally, I met a bank manager, who approved the loan,” he shared.It took another six to seven months for the duo to refurbish the place and finally Potli was launched on August 15, 2011.

He never looked back since. The restaurant was rated one of the top Indian restaurants in London by Tatler in 2013. Potli’s dal makhani was named as one of the top 5 Indian dishes by Hardens. It hosted several celebrities, including Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in 2011. At Potli, Uttam had tried to popularise the commercial Indian dishes, sold at marketplaces. The concept was inspired by the famed biryani brand of Hyderabad, Paradise; Tunde Kababi of Lucknow; Alkauser of Delhi and of course, the quintessential Indian dhabas. But, what motivated Uttam to start an Indian restaurant to tickle the taste buds of Britons? The entrepreneur with a typical Indian facial morphology took a deep breath before he answered that. Much to his surprise, he says that he discovered that the Indian restaurants in London weren’t selling genuine dishes. They had, as he claims, either Anglicised or transformed the dishes into something very hot and spicy to give Europeans a ‘high’ after a few shots of tequila on a Saturday date night. “Indian food was considered to be the cheapest in the country. The pocket-friendly chicken Madras, balti chicken, chicken tikka masala and vindaloo defined Indian cuisine, thanks to the curry houses here. But, none of these were truly Indian,” he adds.

For instance, the vindaloo, which is primarily a tangy Goan pork delicacy, was being cooked with chicken, prawns or lamb. The word vindaloo originated from vinegar and garlic. However, the curry houses there had apparently turned it into the hottest dish, served with unidimensional heat of red chili powder. It wasn’t a challenge for Uttam to introduce the cuisine in London, home to over 10,000 Indian restaurants. The real challenge was to bust the myth surrounding it.

In fact, Uttam has come a long way from when an English couple left Potli for not finding balti chicken in its menu to serving pani puri, vegetable chops, shammi kebab and a lot more Indian stuff to the westerners. And much like Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge’s Amrish Puri, Uttam sticks to his Indian side. “I was inspired by the way my grandmother would cook for 40 to 50 people alone,” he chuckles.","Uttam’s passion for serving authentic and impeccably-cooked Indian dishes to the westerners called for the comparison.

Rising demands for vegan vacations,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/22/rising-demands-for-vegan-vacations-1777285.html,"Thursday, February 22, 2018 02:32 PM +0530","WASHINGTON D.C: Planning to go on a vacation? Sometimes, vegetarians and vegans can struggle to find decent food while staying in a hotel that also has non-vegetarian food items.

Fret not! Many tour operators are there to help you, especially if you are a vegan.

Travel firm VegVoyages was launched in 2004, offering three trips in one country. The firm, which specializes in vegan adventure tours in Asia, now runs up to 23 trips a year in five different countries in 2018.

Based in Texas in the United States, it is one of several operators across the world catering to the growing market of ethical tourists, who are seeking to experience different cultures without harming animals, exploiting people or destroying the environment, The Forbes reported.

One unique thing about vegetarian and vegan vacations is the sustainability and responsible living while enjoying vegan foods served in some hotels exclusively for such tourists.

“There’s definitely been an increase in the demand for vegan travel. More people around the world are warming up to vegan ideas, concepts and benefits who were previously put off by the mere mention of the word ‘vegan’, much less considering it as a full-time or part-time diet in their daily life,"" said VegVoyages co-founder, Zac Lovas.

""This directly fuels vegan travel whether it’s more vegans searching for vegan travel options or more non-vegans not fearing to be on a tour with vegans and eating vegan meals for one or two weeks at a time,” Lovas added.

Lovas stated that food is one of the biggest incentives for travellers to start a vegan tour.

“People don’t want to go to a country and be able to only eat side dishes and salads, or be stuck eating the same thing that they eat back home. One of the benefits of travelling on a vegan trip is to be able to enjoy eating what the locals eat and not having to worry about whether or not it’s 100% vegan. You can still get a glimpse into the local culture and history through the community’s cuisine on a vegan adventure,” he explained.

Popular destinations for vegan tourists include- India, Bali and Sumatra in Indonesia and Laos. The age range of tourists varies from 18 to 80 years and include both single and couples from all walks of life.

Owing to the increasing demand, Lovas's travel firm has increased its group size from just eight people to 18.

According to Lovas, during the first seven years of running the company, most people identified themselves as ‘vegetarian’. But, many others consider themselves as vegan nowadays.

Approximately 75 percent of the tourists are vegan, while 25 percent are non-vegan, the latter typically comprising of friends or spouses of vegans, or those who are health-conscious. The company’s repeat customer base is between 70 to 80 percent respectively.

Tour operator Tierno Tours in Concord, North Carolina, has also seen a rise in demand for vegan travel.

In 2010, it ran the first of its annual Vegano Italiano trips to Italy. These trips became so popular that the company launched Vegan Travel Club soon.

In 2016, in collaboration with veteran eco-vegan travel agency Green Earth Travel, the company added new destinations to its 2017 calendar. The new destinations included Peru, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. The tours feature a range of activities, such as celebrity vegan speakers, plant-based cooking demonstrations, and visits to wineries and heritage sites.

“Because we have a lot of repeat business we try to develop different tours every year. Some, like Italy and Ireland, we continue to do every year, and others, like San Francisco or Peru, are a one-time deal. Some of our choices are based on prices and some places become more favourable because airfares go down or money exchanges are to our advantage. Locations also come in and out of favour,” said Vegan Travel Club co-founder Gretchen Sheridan.

""Right now, Ireland and Scotland have become very popular due to a lot of movies and hit TV shows being filmed there. Berlin, Rome and Barcelona are also big attractions because of the sheer number of vegan eateries there,” Sheridan added.

Donna Zeigfinger, the owner of Green Earth Travel celebrated its 20th-anniversary last year. Having experience in working in the travel industry for the last 30 years, she said that people have been enquiring on vegan vacations and adventure trips, along with a large demand for vegan festivals, culinary tours and health conference tours on cruises.

Vegan vacations are not only confined to land-based tours. A first plant-based cruise was recently announced by Australia.

In 2017, the world’s first all-vegan cruise took place from London to Norway, carrying 1,881 guests from 34 countries. This was organized by German company Vegan Travel, which specialises in river and ocean cruises.

“A lot of my clients used to be the honeymoon couple where one was vegan and the other wasn’t, or the one child in the family was the vegan. Now it’s the couple where both are vegan or the whole family’s vegan,” Zeigfinger added.

“When it comes to accommodation, hotels must consider more than just food. Hotels need to be accommodating when it comes to things like bedding. Most nowadays will provide allergy-free bedding, so that means no feather pillows or wool blankets. Most of the tour operators these days now have a better understanding of what a vegan is and will go out of their way to accommodate people. If not, we don’t use them again,” she explained.

Managing director Dirk Bocklage has come up with the idea of hosting murder mystery dinners and theatre events and performed on cruise ships.

One of the newest players in the vegan vacation market is CPG Vegan Trips, a travel firm which allows tourists to spend some time with animals without causing them any harm.

Founded by the renowned animal advocate and author Colleen Patrick-Goudreau, it hosted its first wildlife trip for 22 people to Thailand in October last year.

The company plans to launch more such trips this year, with North Vietnam and the Alsace region of France being on the agenda. It has also recently sold out its first trip in 2019 in just two days to Rwanda in Africa. (ANI)

National Banana Festival 2018: Go for ‘gold’,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/19/national-banana-festival-2018-go-for-gold-1775291.html,"Tuesday, February 20, 2018 12:08 PM +0530","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: “If you eat the chips made from popoulu, you won’t ever care for other banana chips,” someone advises from a stall, nodding at the fattest banana you would have seen ever in your entire life - the popoulu.

It seems like a claim you should take with a pinch of salt, but one look at the crispy, big, banana chips packed in a small sachet neatly arranged next to the big bunch of popoulus, and one would fall for it. Just one popoulu can weigh 500 grams.The Vellayani Temple grounds bursts with an eclectic array of bananas from across the nation as it hosts the National Banana Festival 2018. With 200 stalls, the biggest expo in the city is a sneak peek into the enticing and surprising world of bananas.

The five-day festival which started on Saturday is organised by the Centre for Innovation in Science and Social action in partnership with Kalliyoor grama panchayat and several other governments and non-government organisations.A stroll through the expo and one can see bananas of all shapes, sizes, hues and tastes. Bananas from Bengal, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala among others, are displayed in all its largely ‘golden’ grandeur.

Traditional agricultural tools on display at the banana festival

The fattest popoulu, a variety indigenous to Hawaii; the ‘aayiram kaa poovan’ (literally the 1,000-finger banana), the longest variety which is as long as the trunk of an elephant; the ‘praying hands banana’ where the bananas are fused together resembling a praying hand, the ‘Pisang Berlin’ banana which is loaded with vitamin A; the medicinal ‘patchai naadan’ which can aid in healing chicken pox, figure among the myriad banana varieties vying for attention at a one-of-a-kind expo in the city.

There are also value-added banana products: Jams, pickles, chocolates, cookies, biscuits, flour, footwear, bags, carpets, health mixes, halwas, and fabric made from bananas and its fiber. An exhibition of photographs capturing the vast range of banana varieties is also arranged at the fest.

Traditional agricultural implements from the days of yore are also on the display. Apart from bananas and value-added products, seminars, buyer-seller meets, farmers’ meet, screening of documentaries related to bananas, cultural programmes, competitions for children and farmers are some of the programmes charted along with the fest.

Of course, what is a banana fest without a grandiose culinary treat of bananas. A sumptuous banana feast replete with more than 20 dishes and two payasams, all made of different kinds of bananas.

What’s on show

Around 100 varieties of bananas sourced from different parts of the state and across the nation are on display

Jams, pickles, chocolates, cookies, biscuits, flour, footwear, bags, carpets, health mixes, halwas, fabric made from bananas and its fibre, are some among the highlights.

"Say cheese, and monk will deliver unto you",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/20/say-cheese-and-monk-will-deliver-unto-you-1775789.html,"Tuesday, February 20, 2018 07:42 AM +0530","BENGALURU: Nestled in a quiet shady corner in T C Palya is Gualbert Bhavan, is a seminary of the Vallombrosan Benedictine Congregation and the home to Vallombrosa cheese. The Vallombrosa cheese, initiated by Father K L Michael, is considered to be amongst the finest in the city and produces about 100 kg of cheese every day with a team of just seven members.

The unit makes 10 different varieties of cheese such as Bocconcini, Ricotta, Mascarpone and Caciotta with 500 litres of buffalo milk sourced every day from a farm in Bannerghatta. But the one most in demand is the Burrata, a buffalo milk cheese where the outer layer is made from mozzarella and the inside, stracciatella and cream. “This one particular variety goes all over the country. Nobody makes Burrata cheese with buffalo milk. So, it’s in huge demand among chefs across India. It is the most popular one in Bengaluru as well,” states Father Michael. His clientele list includes luxury hotels such as the Taj, The Oberoi and J W Marriot. Vallombrosa cheese has made quite a name for itself even with the retail market. “We also get visitors coming in to sample our cheese from different parts of the globe. If they like what they taste, we get huge orders from them too,” he adds.

Father Michael, popularly known as the monk who makes cheese, studied in Rome for eight years. He was appointed as the head of Gualbert Bhavan in 2000. “It was around that time our heads in Rome suggested I take up the art of making cheese. Back then, cheese was only coming up in the Indian markets. So, I was sent for training near Naples in Northern Italy,” he says. But on returning, he realised that the way things worked here was different from that in Italy. “Everything is different here, right from the weather to the way a business runs. I didn’t know where to start,” he shares.

In 2004, an Italian business man who frequently visited India for work suggested Father Michael to start making mozzarella cheese for the Indian market. “Franco Thrumby was always travelling to major metropolitan cities in the country and he noticed that he was yet to come across good pizza cheese. He then gave me the idea to start working with buffalo milk,” he says. Up until then, cheese made out of buffalo milk was a rarity in the country. “It’s been growing since then. The quantity produced has been steadily increasing. We make about 100 kg of cheese a day.”

Today, a small team of around seven members has orders coming in from all over the country including Mumbai, Chennai, Pune and Goa. “The process by itself is not very difficult. But it does take time. Most varieties take around five hours to get ready. We don’t require a big workforce for it. Even with the huge demand, we are able to meet the orders with our small team,” says Father Michael adding, “Sometimes, we get adultered milk and that affects the quality of the cheese.”

Father Michael says the main aim of the venture is to help students who are preparing for priesthood. “This is just a side-business we run to make our ends meet. Everything earned from this is used mainly for the students and then to run the community,” says Father Michael. “We have no plans of making it a full-scale enterprise. It gives us enough to keep us running. And that’s all we are looking for,”

he says. For more details about Vallombrossa cheese, visit its website www.vallombrosacheese.com.","BENGALURU: Nestled in a quiet shady corner in T C Palya is Gualbert Bhavan, is a seminary of the Vallombrosan Benedictine Congregation and the home to Vallombrosa cheese.

Now there are varieties like pizza dosa, cheesy pasta dosa, chocolate dosa…the list goes on, and there around five different restaurants and brands in the city curating more flavours to their menu to appease the ever-growing customer base. We delve into this latest street food trend that has got Chennai’s foodies on the edge.

Chennai’s first dosa-exclusive centre was started in Velachery about a year ago by entrepreneurs Dhamodharan and Sheik Dawood. “In our travels across the country, we realised that street food is a big hit with the public. We wanted to venture into the food business; we ideated about Tosai as Chennai didn’t have such a place yet,” says Sheik Dawood.

As we arrive at Tosai Anna Nagar, the large crowd watches, mesmerised, as the chef expertly pours a large dollop of batter on to the black stove, rounding it out with a davara before adding generous amounts of cheese, curry, peas, and vegetables and spreading it out evenly. Next comes cheese, loads and loads of it, grated over the entire steaming ensemble, before cutting it out evenly like a pizza — taking all but five minutes to make the famous pizza dosa from Tosai is the fastest selling among its 99 varieties.



Pushing the numbers a bit further is Dosart, Kilpauk, which boasts around 111 flavours. “We added paneer tikka, pasta and Maggi varieties of dosa too, which no one else is doing in the market,” claims Anish Akkalaneni, co-founder, Dosart, that was launched last month.

Fans of the trend say what they love most about this is the surprisingly new flavours and combos. “For ages, we have eaten only the simple dosa with sambhar and chutney. And now, to be able to taste this many types is a wonder,” says Gopalachari, a retired CA, who says he plans to come often to taste all the varieties at least once.

While there are several fans, there are some who feel the traditional plain dosa is the best. “This idea of 99-variety dosas is not new, as northern cities of Tamil Nadu had it long before. Tosai’s unique creations like dry fruit dosa, pizza dosa, and Dubai special are great. Other varieties didn’t impress me much as they were repetitive,” says Arun, food critic on Zomato.

Sudharshan, another foodie, agrees, adding,“For me, a dosai should be simple and easy to eat. I don’t like something filled with cheese and other condiments,” he rues.","CHENNAI: From a simple crispy breakfast served with hot sambhar to a scrumptious snack of several lip-smacking varieties, the simple dosa has come a long way.
Now there are varieties like pizza dosa, cheesy pasta dosa, chocolate dosa…the list goes on, and there around five different restaurants and brands in the city curating more flavours to their menu to appease the ever-growing customer base.
We delve into this latest street food trend that has got Chennai’s foodies on the edge.

Authenticook invites you home for a meal- The New Indian Express,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/20/authenticook-invites-you-home-for-a-meal-1775801.html,"Tuesday, February 20, 2018 07:30 AM +0530","CHENNAI: If you are looking for experiences and stories weaved along with the food you eat, look no further. A two-year-old Mumbai-based company, Authenticook has made it possible for you to have India on a plate, from the comfort of your own city. The operations have recently begun in namma Chennai, and we explore more about the company that aims to give you a unique social dining experience in other people’s homes.

The idea for the food start-up emerged when three friends, Aneesh Dhairyawan, Priyanka Deshpande and Ameya Deshpande set out on a trip to Leh. “We are travel and food enthusiasts, and it was easy to get access to food like burgers, pizzas, and pastas but not the authentic cuisine of that particular region or community. We wanted a chance to enter a local home, understand their culture and have a meal with them, however simple it maybe,” narrates Aneesh.

After contemplating the idea, the trio began the company in 2015, introducing the concept of ‘food surfing’ to India. At Authenticook, you will be put in touch with home chefs of your respective city or other cities (in case of travellers), who serve authentic meals in their homes. “The website allows you to pick the cuisine, meal and also to request the date. According to the availability, the meal date will be fixed and you can go to the cooks’ home and have a memorable time! It allows you to understand different cuisines, communities and also appreciate it,” he adds.

Spread across 17 cities, there are close to 10 hosts in Chennai who can give you a taste of Punjabi flavours, authentic Tamil Nadu cuisine and even a typical Coorgi meal. “Each host has a speciality — from Tamil temple food, authentic Mangalorean, Marwari to Sindhi food…there’s everything. Every family has a story and it gives you the knowledge of why a dish is cooked a certain way and so on,” says Aneesh.

To get a first-hand experience, we were invited to dine at the house of Rupa Rajamani at Egmore, a banker-cum-home chef who recently got on board with the Authenticook team. A warm welcome and a few minutes of introductory greetings were all that a bunch of strangers gathered at Rupa’s home needed to break bread.

Opening her kitchen to us, filled with the aroma of piping hot food, Rupa says, “I grew up in Kolkata. I used to visit the clubs there, thrice a week with my parents. Being vegetarians, we always used to look for a substitute for meat and the way the dishes were served in the clubs really stuck to me. So, even after so many years, the memories are fresh and that’s what I will be giving the diners who come to my home — a piece of ‘Calcutta Colonial Club meal’,” she grins.

While the company promotes the widespread concept of ‘Unity in diversity’, on a plate, their objectives are manifold. Yogita Uchil, Authenticook South’s community manager-cum-homechef who specialises in the Mangalorean cuisine, shares, “The concept is about reviving traditional food, and also empowering women/home cooks who have the skill and time but need a platform to provide healthy home-cooked food!” she declares.

In an era where food is delivered at the comfort of your own doorstep, dwindling social interactions, imagine sitting around a table at the house of a stranger, meeting different people with different stories, over a scrumptious meal! “Everyone wants to go back to basics now — eat and explore authentic recipes and also bond with people. Though this concept is new in the city, with awareness, it’s sure to catch up,” adds Yogita.

Meet the home chefs

Esplanade: Fishy affair with Bengali flavours,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/17/esplanade-fishy-affair-with-bengali-flavours-1774390.html,"Saturday, February 17, 2018 12:30 PM +0530","BENGALURU: Esplanade, which has been giving solace to all the homesick Bengalis in Bengaluru, is hosting a fish festival currently, with dishes that taste like they were made right at home and served hot. On a rainy weeknight, we made our way to the restaurant and found it to be full of families and youngsters catching an early dinner.

We started the meal with the Chingri Macher Piyali – minced prawn and onion cakes – which were soft and melted in our mouths, served with the pungent kasundi. The Loita Macher Bora – crispy fried Bombay Duck – is another winner on this limited menu, and when paired with a masala coke, this combination is perfect for a rainy day.

After loading up on the starters, we tried Aar Macher Shorshe – catfish in mustard gravy – and the Bhapa Chingri – steamed scampi in coconut and mustard gravy – with rice. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and rich. Do make sure you come hungry, and don’t load up on the starters, or you won’t have room to really enjoy and savour the flavours of the mains. The seafood was very fresh, and the strong mustard flavours are sure to spread a warm, comforting feeling with every bite you take. Those who can handle a fair share of spice, do give the Kanchalanka Whole Bhetki - sea bass in green chilli gravy – a try. Fair warning – the dish is spicy and HAS to be shared, as the sheer size of the sea bass will keep you full for a long time.

After this rich and heavy meal, we had a little space left for something sweet, and the Nolen Gur ice cream did the trick. This date palm jaggery ice cream is a Bengali speciality, and was the perfect end to the meal. The only thing missing was a crane to lift us from our seats after this scumptious meal. The fish festival is on till Sunday, so do go do give some of these dishes a taste.","After loading up on the starters, we tried Aar Macher Shorshe – catfish in mustard gravy – and the Bhapa Chingri – steamed scampi in coconut and mustard gravy – with rice.

"Lukhmi, the Mince Stuffed Hyderabadi Savoury",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/17/lukhmi-the-mince-stuffed-hyderabadi-savoury-1774438.html,"Saturday, February 17, 2018 02:10 AM +0530","HYDERABAD: The Hyderabadi cuisine has a variety of scrumptious snacks, and Lukhmi, the flaky savoury stuffed with spicy minced meat is definitely one of them. A popular starter at Hyderabadi marriages, this dish also works well for a quick pairing with tea over an adda with friends.

The name lukhmi originates from the word luqma, which means a small bite in Urdu. Unlike the samosa, lukhmi is usually a flat square shaped flour parcel with a flaky and crisp upper crust and stuffed with beef or mutton based filling.

You have the snack in other shapes like triangles in some cafes and a vegetarian version mostly with a potato filling is also available. It is usually served with chopped onions and green chillies, though some discerning persons prefer having it with kababs as a side.

To prepare lukhmi, wheat flour is kneaded with yoghurt, butter and a little water. The mince or vegetarian filling is cooked separately, with turmeric, onions, ginger, garlic and spices. After resting, the dough is rolled out into a huge rectangular roti. Multiple mince pockets are stuffed on the rolled dough, and the whole thing is covered by another large roti. Finally, this is cut into multiple small squares each housing a kheema pocket.

The edges are closed by pressing them often with a fork, and the stuffed parcel is deep frying in oil. As the colour of the patty changes to golden while frying, the lukhmi is ready for consumption. In another method, small flour pockets are stuffed with fillings and sealed before frying.

The snack had lost some of its popularity over several decades, as many places in the old city stopped serving it. However, it has made a comeback of sorts in the last few years with an increased interest in lost Hyderabadi recipes. Alpha Hotel, Paradise and Rio are some places in Secunderabad whose lukhmis are sought after, while Shahran, Shadab and Nayaab near Charminar are popular for their mutton versions. In a more elite environment, Zaiqa-E-Hyderabad in Banjara Hills and SodaBottleOpenerWala in Jubilee Hills are two places which serve the dish. Some clubs of Hyderabad are also known for their expertise in this dish.

A favourite for the beef version is Alhumdulillah Hotel, a street food outlet just opposite the well-known restaurant with the same name in Nampally. In the evenings, you can see lukhmis and shami kababs being prepared right in front of you. Iqbal Cafe near Purani Haveli is another place where food lovers vouch for their beef lukhmis.

"Do you like your tea black, green or- The New Indian Express",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/17/do-you-like-your-tea-black-green-or-purple-1774389.html,"Saturday, February 17, 2018 02:09 AM +0530","BENGALURU: Green tea is a fad in the city but it may soon be replaced by purple tea. Three Bengalureans – Adarsh Kashyap, Abhishek Nagarkar and Avinash Cheluvaraja – are on a mission to bring back the many teas, starting with the purple variety Indians used to have before the British introduced the commonly consumed fermented tea.

Their company, Eco Addiction, sells the tea leaves and bags through various retail stores and serves the beverage (hot and cold versions) at different cafes such as Bundar in Koramangala.The purple tea is prepared from a tropical flower, butterfly pea, which resembles the female genitals and is dark blue in colour. Its powdered version is also used by watering holes in the city to make mocktails and cocktails, say its producers, who farm this flower in Malavalli (about 100 km from Bengaluru).

Within a few years, green tea has tapped `50 crore sales, and is increasing at 60 per cent in India. But Adarsh Kashyap, CEO, Eco Addiction, says a lot of people are now discontinuing having it due to its bitter taste, caffeine and presence of nicotine. People always look for something healthy as well as tasty, and that's why he started looking for different kinds of tea. On the other hand, purple tea tastes sweeter than green tea.

But Susmita Das Gupta, founder of the group Its Our Cuppa Tea, says it would not be right to compare purple tea with green tea. ""Tea is not a remedy. They have some health benefits depending on the way you drink it. Benefits of black and green teas are about the same, but the minute you add milk to black tea, its properties change."" She feels people generally experiment with new variants of tea for novelty, not for their health benefits. ""Health benefits would be the fifth or sixth reason to buy it,"" she says.

Hundred-year-old tea

The company claims to be the only producer of this purple tea in the country. Adarsh says, ""We used to grow a lot of different kinds of teas before the East India Company introduced fermented tea. We want to bring back the era of those teas that were grown and used in India hundreds of years ago, but were suppressed by the British rule.""

It is mainly produced presently by tea growers in Kenya. According to a news portal, a scientist from Tocklai Tea Research Institute (TTRI) has revealed that the Kenyan purple tea originated in Assam, and that these tea bushes can still be found there. He is quoted as saying that since the tea originated in Assam under the British rule and with scientists working in India migrating to Kenya, most of tea cultivation practices used in the country are of Indian (Assamese) origin.

The plant is a perennial creeper and takes about six to eight months to grow to about three feet and reach the production stage depending on water and weather. ""The crop is like the rose plant that gives flowers almost every day. It needs trimming like the rose and wiring like tomato plants, but purple tea crops need more space to grow."" Hence, once the plant grows, one may not find weeds, as the plant occupies majority of the space. ""Initially, weeding needs to be done every 15 days,"" mentions Adarsh.

It is a challenging task. He says, ""It is a labour-intensive crop where for an acre, we need minimum five members to look after the plantation every day. We get more harvest from April to June. Rainy season is not good for the crop as it affects drying of the flowers. It takes about two to three days for drying. Once it dries, the weight of the flowers reduces from say 10 kg to 1 kg.""

Abhishek Nagarkar, mentor-chief adviser, says, ""The flower is edible too, or it can also be powdered and filled in tea bags. The processing and packaging happens at the manufacturing unit in Hassan. Now, the tea is available in cafes in the city and we do corporate sales. It will be available at retail stores such as MK Ahmed and Nilgiris from the first week of March.""

Adarsh collected seeds from Thailand. ""I collected about 6 kg of good seeds for almost a year in 2014. Not all seeds would lead to plant growth.""He took an acre of land on lease in Bidadi in 2015. He says, ""The lease expired recently, and so, we shifted the production to a six-acre plot in Malavalli."" Abhishek adds, ""It can produce about six tonnes of the product annually.""Adarsh also did a pilot survey by going to colleges. ""The students liked the tea and said they would try it for the love of its colour and taste,"" he says.","BENGALURU: Green tea is a fad in the city but it may soon be replaced by purple tea.

My father was in the Indian army and my mother would be out in the fields working. So, I helped in the kitchen most of the time.

I began cooking simple rice and daal tadka, and soon took interest in cooking. I used to cook mid-day meals at the primary school back in my hometown — Uttaranchal. I later decided that I wanted to cook for a living.

After doing a course in western cuisine in Delhi, I travelled extensively to places like Bahrain, Dubai, Libya, Goa, Jaipur, Amritsar and now Chennai. Every place has taught me a lot about flavours and spices, and I’ve learnt to cook continental, Indian and Middle-Eastern cuisines. Right now, I’m focusing on Rajasthani cuisine, as we are curating a food festival there.

The cuisine of the Rajputs and Marwaris stands out for its vibrancy. It is very simple, with a lot of spices and buttermilk. In olden days, because not many vegetables were grown, besan was used to make dishes like ghatta curry (besan dumplings) cooked in buttermilk gravy. For non-vegetarian food, wild boar and other animals were hunted down. Nowadays, mutton is preferred.

Millets like bajra and jowar are used in dishes, because they need a lot of water and are easy to grow. They are also healthy and rich in fibre. During winters, baingan ka bharta with bajre ki roti is made.



Another important ingredient in Rajasthani cuisine is ghee. Restaurants and sweet shops in Jaipur and other parts of the state, cook their food in pure ghee. It makes their food healthy and tasty.

Chillies are also used abundantly in Rajasthani food. They are grown at homes because most dishes require a lot of chillies. One variety is mathania chilli, usually grown in the region of Jodhpur. It is used in Laal Maas, a dish which is made with mutton these days, but was traditionally made with boar meat. Mathania chilli is bright red and fiery. Fenugreek seeds, coriander, nigella seeds and cumin are other ingredients in Rajasthani cuisine.

I have learnt about so many cuisines and flavours from different states, but what remains a dream is tribal cuisine. The quality of ingredients and spices used by them is different from ours, because they are closer to nature.

When it comes to South Indian, I have eaten specialities from all the states. My favourite, though, is Andhra cuisine. It is spicy and sour at the same time because of tamarind. I also want to explore Chettinad food for all its spices.

Being vegan has given me a burst of energy: Divya Sathyaraj,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/14/being-vegan-has-given-me-a-burst-of-energy-divya-sathyaraj-1773414.html,"Thursday, February 15, 2018 07:32 AM +0530","CHENNAI: As a young girl, Divya Sathyaraj was a poor eater. She always nibbled away at her food. But as time passed, stories told by her mother about the nutritive value of food motivated her to study more about food.

“I always wanted to be a nutritionist and know more about the science and therapeutic value of food,” she adds. And belonging to a family where her parents and brother were health-conscious, it did not take long for Divya to follow suit. The celebrity nutritionist, who is all set to launch her own brand of organic tea (D House Green Tea) and rice (Shree Chandika Farmstead Products), talks to CE about her tryst with veganism.

It was after getting a lot of offers from several companies to endorse their products and health drinks that a friend suggested Divya should consider launching her own products. “I have a tea estate in Conoor which I take care of and a farm in Coimbatore as well. So my friend suggested that it would be a good idea for me to launch my own organic tea and grain varieties,” she recalls. With her tight work schedule and shuffling between two clinics, Divya was uncertain about its practicality. “I did not want to do something for the sake of doing it. If I started something, I would make sure I put my all into it,” she says. And so after a lot of research, going to farms, meeting with people and doing a couple of surveys, her venture, D House Green Tea and Shree Chandhika Farmstead Products, was born.

Divya who has been a vegetarian for a long time now turned vegan two years ago. Her energy levels have increased so much ever since.

“It is the best thing that has ever happened to me,” she smiles. Though veganism is slowly gaining ground in the city, Divya points out that the lack of stores which supply quality products is a problem. “I go to Terra, which is quite far for me, but that is the only such store where you get good quality products. They have interesting snacks like wheatgrass laddoo. But there aren’t many options for vegans here. I feel it’s a lot easier to be a vegan if you are living abroad,” she shares.

Divya says that her products will be made available in stores by the end of March. She is also thinking of venturing into vegetables. “It is difficult to find good quality spinach and tomatoes in supermarkets in India. I want to take it slow because I am just starting out,” she adds.

What do you have to say about Chennaiites’ food habits? “Earlier, people would only come to me to lose weight. But now, I see a lot of people who are genuinely interested in their health and are understand that food can heal,” she says.","But as time passed, stories told by her mother about the nutritive value of food motivated her to study more about food.

"Tomatoes, Love at first bite",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/13/tomatoes-love-at-first-bite-1772878.html,"Wednesday, February 14, 2018 07:50 AM +0530","CHENNAI: The Mexicans discovered tomatoes, the Spaniards brought them to Europe, the Italians used the cheerful red berries as table decoration, the French called them pommes d’amour, or ‘apples of love’, and the two cooing pigeons on the ledge above our balcony are totally ruining my cherry tomatoes. But, it’s the season of love, and I’m prepared to forgive the birds.

After all, I didn’t really sweat to bring up the tomato plants. Usually, I just bung the remains of a squished healthy tomato in the soil, and within days, there is a fresh crop of seedlings. This time however, my brother-in-law gifted me a batch. Squirrels have been chasing each other all over my plants too, and only two saplings survived. They have now grown all over the grill in the kitchen balcony to give us handfuls of cherry tomatoes that taste as good as they look. But then, I may be biased — I love tomatoes!

What’s not to love about them? Tomato seeds are easily available. They are eager to germinate and grow. Once transplanted, they are easy to manage. They are fruit within three months and it’s love at first sight. Seeds are easy to harvest and sow. And you can push the difficulty level of the gardening a notch higher by trying to grow different varieties of tomatoes.

As children, my friends and I used to rescue tomato plants that came up in unlikely places like bus-stands and footpaths. Ah, the innocent pleasure of doing good! Sometimes the plants did well. But some plants never came up, and some gave fruits that tasted odd. Lesson learnt is that if you want healthy tomatoes, it is best to start with healthy seeds.

Step 1

Get seeds from a known source of organic seeds. Or buy healthy, ripe tomatoes from an organic store. Save some of the seeds from a juicy tomato. You could put some directly into a pot, or dry them for use later.

Step 2

Sow the seeds in a pot with a good mix of soil, cocopeat and compost. Cocopeat makes the pot light and suitable for terrace and balcony gardens. The seeds should sprout in a week. Relax, wait for them to grow and have a few real leaves. Then transplant into separate pots. Use stakes to support the tomato plants.

Step 3

Nurture with compost when you see flowers. Soon, you should have one or more tomatoes blushing in your plants. When they are nice and red, pluck them and share it with your loved ones.

Like in true love, there are many villains in our tomato lore too. Watch out for leaf miners, the critters that cause the white trails on leaves. Snip off affected leaves. White mealy bugs? Wash them off with plain water, or add a little neem oil to the wash. Brown patches on the underside of tomatoes? Low nutrition may be the cause. Add powdered eggshells or bury banana peels in the soil. Grow some marigolds, garlic and onion bulbs close to the tomato plants — they are the good guys in the tomato love story.

The perfect match

Love is all about pairing, right? Tomatoes and cheese can give strawberry and cream a run for the rupaiya. But as a tomato gardener, you can let love bloom by getting the carrots and tomatoes growing in the same container. No, you won’t get carrots, but you’re likely to get healthy tomatoes and carrots.

Ah, the simple pleasures of gardening!","But then, I may be biased — I love tomatoes!

This cafe in Tokyo has robots making coffee,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/13/this-cafe-in-tokyo-has-robots-making-coffee-1772632.html,"Tuesday, February 13, 2018 09:52 AM +0530","TOKYO: Japan has a new cafe where customers can enjoy coffee brewed and served by a robot barista.

The robot named Sawyer debuted this week at Henna Cafe in Tokyo's downtown business and shopping district of Shibuya. The shop's name in Japanese means ""strange cafe.""

The single-armed robot scans a ticket purchased from a vending machine and greets the customer.

""Would you care for a delicious coffee?"" the barista, with a screen showing a pair of cartoon eyes, asks in a flat tone. ""I can make one better than human beings around here.""

It grinds the coffee beans, fills a filter and pours hot water over a paper cup for up to five people at once. A cup of brewed coffee costs 320 yen (USD 3) and takes a few minutes.

Sawyer can also operate an automated machine for six other hot drinks including cappuccino, hot chocolate and green tea latte.

Customers, many of them young men, took photos with their smartphones while they waited in line.

The cafe operator, travel agency H.I.S. Co., says robots can increase productivity while also entertaining customers.

""An essential point is to increase productivity,"" said Masataka Tamaki, general manager of corporate planning at H.I.S. He said only one person needs to oversee the robot cafe, compared to several people needed at a regular coffee shop, so it can serve better quality coffee at a reasonable price.

Tamaki says it's not just about efficiency. ""We want the robot to entertain customers so it's not like buying coffee at a vending machine,"" he said.

Takeshi Yamamoto, a 68-year-old restaurant employee who works in the neighborhood, said his first experience with the robot cafe was very enjoyable, and his robot-made coffee was delicious.

""It's quite rich, and tastes very good,"" Yamamoto said, as he took a sip. ""You can get machine-made coffee at convenience stores, too, and it's actually good. But here, I had great fun.""","TOKYO: Japan has a new cafe where customers can enjoy coffee brewed and served by a robot barista.

""Our Prime Minister is a dream to cook for. He is not fussy and loves unpretentious food. They needn't be fancy, so we concentrate on making it nutritious and healthy. He has such a busy schedule, so I made sure that he ate food that gives you energy,"" Kapoor told Gulf News.



Kapoor on Sunday shared a series of photographs along with Modi and captioned it: ""Absolute honour and privilege to cook for Modi...""



On Modi's eating habits, he said: ""He believes in simple vegetarian food and is a believer that food is a great way to learn about each other's countries and cultures... So there was a lot of food that fused elements from India and the UAE.""



Dosas, beetroot minced kebabs and the comfort Indian food dal and rice always feature on his plate, said the chef.



Kapoor revealed that Modi's breakfast was a flat-bread with nine 'ancient' grains such as millets and rice.



The chef even got to learn some things about food from the Prime Minister. ""We were talking about parathas and he told me about this paratha made with drum-sticks. It sounded very interesting and I told him that I am going try making it in my kitchen.""



Kapoor said that upon tasting the staple breakfast of 'foul medames' for breakfast, Modi compared the cooked fava bean mix to 'paav bhaji' and also sampled the Emirati dessert aseeda fused with rice cake, which reminded him of the Indian halwa, and a no-meat version of harees, which is a dish made with wheat and meat.



However, mezzes containing hummus along with an Indian raita with sprinklings of pomegranate and walnuts stole the show.

Ofir Food Fest: A trailblazing food journey,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/12/ofir-food-fest-a-trailblazing-food-journey-1772326.html,"Tuesday, February 13, 2018 08:06 AM +0530","KOCHI: The Anglo-Indians once had a favourite dish nicknamed the bad-word curry. As hilarious as it may sound, it was another name for the meatball curry. Apparently, the community forefathers considered the word ‘ball’ derogatory which is how the bad-word curry found its place into their food vocabulary. “The Anglo-Indians in Kozhikode still have a hearty laugh when they talk about this traditional cuisine. They have hoards of similar stories -- of their food and their culture that they wish to share.

The Ofir Food Fest, which was organised in Kozhikode provided them with the right platform,” said food enthusiast Aysha Mahmood, who along with her six friends-Naseeb, Nana Muhammed, Shafee Ahmed, Sajeev Kumar and Vikram Chandrasekhar, hosted the fest that concluded on Sunday.The fest, according to Aysha, celebrated the various cuisines of the 30-odd communities in Kozhikode. These included the Bhatkally, Bohra, Thiyya, Gujarathi, Moplah, Konkani Gouda Saraswat Brahmin, Iyers, Syrian Christian, Anglo Indian, and the Goan Mangalorean Konkani communities.

“The Gujarati street in Kozhikode is a hub of various businesses.

Next to it, is the Bohra Masjid in Kuttichira, which is considered the Moppila centre in Kozhikode.

This peaceful co-existence of several communities, inspired us to organise Ofir,” says Aysha.

Love for food and culture

It was her love for food which inspired the food enthusiast in Aysha to organise this event. “I live in Taiwan with my family. I have always been passionate about food and learning more about its culture. Last Eid, I had prepared food videos for 30 days at a stretch, which were uploaded on social media where I explored various menus,” she said. Her brother was the one behind the revival of the Gujarati street in Kozhikode and so Ayesha was well aware of the pulse of the people there. “As we started holding talks among the communities, we realised that they were extremely interested in showcasing their culture,” she said. However, there were apprehensions whether vegetarian dishes would sell as well considering the affinity that the people had towards non-vegetarian dishes.

“However, it was interesting to observe how each community organised their stalls. In fact, everyone was encouraging and it was beautiful,” she said. Several community meetings were held prior to the fest. “We roped in prominent chefs from various hotels to prepare the dishes. Several menus, some of the oldest and most traditional, were written down and given to the chefs to prepare. We cross-checked with each community to find out if we got everything right. At the end, the Ofir food fest was a celebration,” said Aysha. The organisers say they hope to make it a yearly event where they hope to rope in more communities from across Kerala.

Ofir Food Fest

The Ofir Food Fest derives its name from name Ophir which is a mystical port mentioned in the Bible as a vibrant, opulent place where huge vessels docked every three years to carry spices, peacocks, ivory, gold, silver, sandalwood, pearls and monkeys for King Solomon. One of the many theories is that Ophir is Beypore, according to Aysha.","Apparently, the community forefathers considered the word ‘ball’ derogatory which is how the bad-word curry found its place into their food vocabulary.

The cancer, which starts in the esophagus, was already known to be linked to drinking alcohol and smoking, but those risks are heightened by the addition of daily cups of “burning hot” tea, scientists discovered.

The risks to smokers also increase with high-temperature tea drinking, said the study, which examined data on 456,155 Chinese adults ages 30 to 79.

Lv Jun, of Peking University Health Science Centre in China, who co-authored the study, told The Telegraph: “Boiling hot tea will harm the cells in the oesophagus. “If the person also drinks alcohol and smokes, then the harm caused will be more heightened.”

At the start of the study, none of the participants had cancer. Researchers followed half of the participants for at least nine years.

During the study, 1,731 people developed esophageal tumours.

Rates of the disease are relatively high in China, where tea drinking is common and many men smoke and drink.

Chinese people often drink tea from flasks that they carry with them to their workplace and regularly fill up with hot water.

Very few Chinese drink traditional British tea, which less hot than Chinese varieties as it also usually taken with cold milk.

People in Russia, Turkey and South America enjoy their tea very hot, with many regularly drinking it at temperatures above 149 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius).

Past research has shown that tea can help to protect against tumours in the digestive tract.

But studies have also suggested that hot liquids and food can cause ""thermal injury"" which can increase the risk factors associated with cancer.

The findings have been published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.","LONDON: Smokers and drinkers should avoid hot tea, as, according to a study, it can increase the risk of esophageal cancer.

This small community of Smartha Brahmins, residing primarily in the Mysuru region, were originally from Sengottai in Tamil Nadu. They migrated to Karnataka a few centuries ago and just as their dialect is a mixture of Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam, their food too is a blend of tastes from all these regions.

A family has been trying to promote their food culture through Adukale brand, and on Sunday they opened their first exclusive store at 51, 7th Cross in Malleswaram, where you can sample the dishes before placing your order.

Signature dishes -- Chomai (steamed rice vermicelli), Gojjavalakki (peppered beaten rice) and Kolakkttaes (steamed rice dumplings) -- and many quintessential south Indian dishes can be sampled here. Their product line includes fenugreek flour or dosa batter, upma mix made from beaten rice and grated coconut and pepper kootu powder.

Black rice, activated charcoal and sesame seeds -- some of these ingredients have already made their way to sandwiches, salads, cocktails and ice creams.



According to Suman Aggarwal, ""Black meals that are infused with activated charcoal are not only healthy for you, but they look exotic and taste fabulous. Activated charcoal binds with toxins and chemicals and hence acts as detox. In fact, higher doses of activated charcoal are used by doctors for treatment of food poisoning.""



Suhasini Sood, Chief Nutrition Officer at Healthie.in, an online healthy food delivery brand which recently introduced a line of black meals and drink on their online menu, has also listed some health benefits of having black food.



* Natural detox: Activated charcoal, one of the most commonly used ingredient to infuse black in the food, is a processed ingredient often made from heated coconut shells or bamboo. The burnt powdered form of charcoal adds the smoky flavour and the crispiness in the food. It is known for its properties of acting as a natural purifier and as an antioxidant and also helps in getting rid of hangovers and other impurities present in the body.



* Natural cure for gastrointestinal distress: Various forms of activated charcoal have been used in our food as well as beauty products as it acts as a natural antioxidant and cleanser. Higher doses of activated charcoal are used by doctors for treatment of food poisoning and varied other gastrointestinal pain. Activated charcoal helps to alleviate uncomfortable gas and bloating. It works by binding the gas-causing by-products in foods that cause discomfort.



* Makes your heart healthy: Black Sesame is enriched with lignans. Lignans help naturally lowering cholesterol levels. It assists in improving lipid profiles and also help in normalizing cholesterol and blood pressure.



* Helps in balancing of hormones: Sesame helps in maintaining the hormonal level of the body. Due to better fatty acid metabolism, it positively affects the sex hormone production in the body.



* Improves digestive health: The fiber in black rice helps to prevent constipation, bloating and other unwanted digestive symptoms. Fiber binds to the waste and toxins within the digestive tract and pulls them out from the body through regular bowel function.



* Prevent diabetes: Consumption of black rice is a much healthier option than processed carbohydrates which are stripped of their fiber and thus slows down the absorption of sugar in the bloodstream. Whereas, black rice contains the entire bran of the grain where the fiber is stored, and fiber is able to help glucose (sugar) from the grain to be absorbed by the body over a longer period of time.



* Teeth whitening: Many people are embarrassed by the yellow appearance of their teeth and conceal their teeth in photos. However, activated charcoal present in black food is a natural cleanser and help in whitening of teeth naturally.

Persia on Your Plate- The New Indian Express,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/02/persia-on-your-plate-1767393.html,"Sunday, February 4, 2018 07:28 PM +0530","HYDERABAD: The glazed plates with Persian motifs reminiscent of Safavids hold delicacies from Iran and as you bite into the juicy chunks of Fasenjan with a spoonful of fragrant saffron rice topped with berries, the taste opens a bouquet of flavours in your mouth. You get the sweet and sour layers combined with the slightly bitter taste of walnuts. And it’s the magic of 20 pomegranates that lend the dish its sweet-tangy taste. Fruits, pepper and saffron are exclusively used in Persian or Iranian cuisine.

The staple that Persians largely consume is fine rice, but surprisingly the authentic Persian biryani doesn’t have a single grain of rice and yet it is the oldest dish of Persia with fire roasted minced mutton cooked in mild spices. It comes served on a hot naan giving the wrong expression of perhaps the oldest version of a pizza. Shares chef Anaida about the dish Esfahan Beryani, “Instead of biryani, it’s called beryani which means ‘roasted in fire’.

The anecdotes say that beryani travelled to the subcontinent with the Mughal emperors and changed its form with the addition of rice which may have happened while the soldiers moved from one place to another and to prepare a wholsesome meal for them rice might have been added.” It has become so popular now that its original form is almost forgotten. And the dish changes its flavours and texture according to the geographical location it is prepared in. Interestingly the spices added in the mutton of the beryani are just cinnamon, saffron and pepper. The addition of other spices in the dish must have happened due to the trade links between Persian region and parts of the subcontinent.

The trail of pomegranates and berries continued with Persian Chicken Bowl consisting of Chicken Jujeh Kebab, chicken chunks cooked in tomato sauce and berries served with sauteed vegetables like cucumber, bell peppers, broccoli, and baby corns.

The whole presentation was a complete and nutritious meal in itself. Anaida, who has Persian-Greek and Indian ancestry shares further, “Also, Haleem is a popular breakfast item in Iran which is cooked slowly with very few spices.” Other than these dishes we recommend the singer-director-actor-chef’s Soop-E-Jadooi, a chicken soup at whose bottom you discover the treasure of pearl barley sprouts, turnips, mushrooms, carrots and corn.

Feast on cheesecakes and burgers without any guilt: This is what vegan chef Mayavi Khandelwal does at her organisation Freedom from Diabetes,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/02/feast-on-cheesecakes-and-burgers-without-any-guilt-this-is-what-vegan-chef-mayavi-khandelwal-does-a-1767360.html,"Saturday, February 3, 2018 01:54 PM +0530","BENGALURU: You don’t have to deprive yourself of all your favourite foods when you choose to go vegan, says Mayavi Khandelwal, a nutri-chef from Mumbai who will be conducting her first Bengaluru workshops in three venues this weekend.The fascinating thing about Mayavi has been her ability to reverse diabetes, hypothyroid, high blood pressure, acute vertigo and asthma just by opting to eat whole plant based food.

It has been 4 years since she had to be hospitalised for her illness. After consultation with her friend who runs an organisation called Freedom from Diabetes, she opted to choose a vegan lifestyle. However, the only hurdle was that she’s a foodie and wouldn’t touch anything that did not taste good.Fifteen days after turning vegan, she tried cheese and she couldn’t stop feeling guilty about it. So then she started innovating recipes that would substitute dairy products. By far, she has invented many recipes and has conducted workshops in Chennai, Delhi, Jaipur and even Sri Lanka. Her workshop in Bengaluru was long over due.

Reversing diabetes and reducing weight

Mayavi weighed 90+ kgs four years ago. Now, she weighs 67. Her secret is eating tasty and healthy food. “I am a typical vegan and don’t use any animal products including leather. Compassion is one side of the story but eating healthy and something tasty is another reason why,” says Mayavi. She confesses that she doesn’t miss dairy at all since she has found alternatives for every food items.

Her favourite is the vegan chocolate ice-cream which she makes it using cocoa powder, dates and tender coconut instead of coconut milk for chocolate like consistency. “It has worked wonders,” she explains.



Marzipan, another favourite confectionery, primarily made with sugar is substituted with dates. When it came to making cheese, she tried using agar-agar powder, a jelly like substance obtained from algae. However, she did not want to use the ingredient so she thought hard as to what can substitute the product and have the same coagulating effect.

Three years ago, Mayavi was struck by the idea to try psyllium husk (also called Isagbol in India) and till date, her vegan cheese recipe is a hit.Prior to becoming a nutri chef, Mayvi was a psychotherapist and also had a chocolate business. Ever since her transformation to veganism, she had to sell off the chocolate business. Now she runs a catering business called ‘My Pure Path’ in Mumbai. “There is not much profit in the business but we keep at it to spread the healthy diet and my personal journey,” says 55-year-old Mayavi.Till date, she hasn’t had the need to visit her doctor and she recently ran the Mumbai marathon. “Four years back, I couldn’t even walk 100 metres. Now I run a 21 km marathons,” she says.

Where to go

She will be hosting the workshop at Carrots, Happy Healthy Me and The Green Path, starting from February 2. Different recipes will be shared in different venues. You can expect to learn the secrets of vegan marzipan, lemon cheesecake, fruit crumble, shepherd pie, pink lemonade, chocolate millet moose and onion pakoras. All recipes will be gluten and dairy free.","After consultation with her friend who runs an organisation called Freedom from Diabetes, she opted to choose a vegan lifestyle.

Clay Pot Chicken with five spices and mushrooms,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/02/clay-pot-chicken-with-five-spices-and-mushrooms-1767362.html,"Saturday, February 3, 2018 01:49 PM +0530","BENGALURU: Born into a family of chefs, I believe that cooking came naturally to me and while experimenting with the ingredients, I came across mushrooms. I found them extremely versatile in nature as mushrooms are rich in lean proteins and have no cholesterol or fat with very low carbohydrates.

I believe they have a very delicate earthy flavour, which complements with any food you pair them with. You will either love mushrooms or you will not, and if you do, you know that they work nearly with any spice or seasoning combination. They always taste different depending on its flavour profile and its processing.

There are different varieties of mushrooms depending on factors such as regions, sizes and flavours and each taste different. Regenerated mushrooms taste slightly stronger and better in flavours as compared to the fresh ones.

My preferred dish is Clay Pot Chicken with five spices, served with rice. Mushrooms complement the dish with its fantastic texture. My mantra of keeping the food simple allows me to use fresh ingredients which enhance the taste of the dish. I generally prefer to use Shiitake mushrooms in my cooking, especially for this dish.

Lip-smacking flavours of the world in Chennai's Taj Club House- The New Indian Express,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/02/lip-smacking-flavours-of-the-world-in-chennais-taj-club-house-1767364.html,"Saturday, February 3, 2018 01:28 PM +0530","CHENNAI: It’s not just idli, dosa and pongal that dominate menus in the city anymore. Chennai’s hotels, big and small, are going that extra mile to serve their customers something out of the ordinary by conducting food festivals. “I shifted to Chennai in 2010. The taste buds of the locals have evolved over the years. It has transitioned from a reluctant traditional crowd to a more open one,” says Sumeet Sood, executive chef, Taj Club House. CE catches up with food bloggers, chefs, and guest chefs to learn more about what’s new in their kitchens.

“I have conducted several food festivals in the city — Mangalorean, Kerala and Pan Asian grills, etc. The older generation is traditional when it comes to food choices and they prefer to go with their comfort food. They don’t want to try something new. But, youngsters, nowadays, are adventurous and they always want to explore new flavours and cuisines,” says Chef Jafar Ali, Gateway IT Expressway.

North Indian and continental cuisine have always been a hit among the locals. But with newer cuisines being introduced, people are now presented with different dishes, spices, and nutritional values. “Many new recipes have been added to our menus, and dishes like kimchi, miso paste, have started becoming popular. Even people have realised that they are rich in nutrients,” adds Sumeet. According to foodies and food bloggers, on an average, there are 50 food festivals a month. Some believe it also helps in the promotion of the hotel.

“Food festivals are usually organised by popular hotels and cafes. It basically helps in their promotion too. But that said, Chennaiites also love that there’s something new that they can look forward too,” says Gowrishanker, a city-based food blogger, and vlogger. Asmitha Madhu, another blogger says, “The regular restaurant menu cannot be changed often but a food festival brings some life to the usual dishes. Often, an expert chef is invited to conduct the festival. The restaurant is also decked up with props and the staff is dressed as per the theme.”

The Ashvita Group has conducted a few food festivals like Bavi bride, Indonesian pop-up, vegan pop-up and recently — around the world in six plates — where guests were served six courses of six different dishes. “We usually don’t have chefs from Chennai, who participate in food festivals. We invite chefs from other cities who have specialised in particular cuisines,” says Sarmishta of Ashvita Nirvana. So while they try to introduce Chennai to new cuisines, are Chennaiites open to it? “Two years ago, they weren’t at all. Now, they want to experiment. But they also want to get back to something that they are familiar with,” she shares.

Anuroopa Banerjee, who conducted the recent pop-up says, “The customers were curious about six cuisines served in six courses. They were also quitewell informed and well travelled.” As per food bloggers and chefs, the trend is mainly Asian, so much so that there are now restaurants that exclusively serve cuisine of a particular country; Ethiopian at Abyssinian, Russian at Winter Palace and Japanese at Teppan Grill and Sushi bar. Dilip Kumar, junior sous chef, Teppan, says, “Customers are now well aware of cuisines and we have to up our game. Hence, we are planning to add burgers and donuts to our menu which will have sushi and wasabi in them. We are also working on incorporating Korean and Mangolian dishes in Japanese cuisine...all to give the customers something new.”","Chennai’s hotels, big and small, are going that extra mile to serve their customers something out of the ordinary by conducting food festivals.

"Fries, fries baby! Mumbai-based restaurant The Bombay Fries is now in Chennai",http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/feb/02/fries-fries-baby-mumbai-based-restaurant-the-bombay-fries-is-now-in-chennai-1767351.html,"Saturday, February 3, 2018 01:10 PM +0530","CHENNAI: For most foodies, their equation with the golden fried potato fingers — French fries — is synonymous with the punch line ‘No one can eat just one’. If you are one of those who swears fries are nourishment, head to The Bombay Fries (TBF), a new place in Chennai that serves 25 varieties of those golden tubes! Tucked away in a lane at Sterling road, this 250 Square feet cafe, which has artsy doodles, also serves nine types of potato tornadoes, milkshakes, and is the perfect place for any ‘fries’ person to have a good time.

The 21-year-old Mumbai-based founder, Sanket Agarwal, shares, “I started R&D work for this in 2016 and opened my first outlet in February 2017 at Vile Parle East. I saw that fries were being sold as a main meal abroad and I thought of bringing this concept to India, but with flavours that will suit the Indian palate.” Sanket has opened branches in different cities in the last month — Dombivali, Mulund, Surat and Chennai. The three-week old outlet here has been receiving rave reviews and its Chennai operation managers, Jinesh and Harsh are ecstatic.

“Before we approached Sanket to talk about starting a franchise here, we had tasted the entire menu. What impressed us was that it was being made of fresh, high quality potatoes as opposed to the common frozen food-style fries.

That’s the USP. Actual potato fries have a different texture, feel and cut,” says Jinesh pointing to their 12mm sized potatoes. “The potatoes are handpicked and segregated according to their size — the bigger ones are used for the fries and the smaller ones for the tornadoes,” he explains. While the fries are served in ginormous boxes, the price is pocket-friendly and draws a huge footfall of college and school students from around the neighbourhood. “I believe in high quality and low margin.

It’s all about good food,” adds Sanket. From Peri Peri, Nutella, chilli cheese fries and red velvet, chocolate oreo, and Nutella shakes, to a variety of twisted fries, signature dishes like Amboo fries, tornado and shake, this café serves it all! “Amboo in Bhutanese means extraordinary and you bet all our Amboo signature dishes are!” grins Jinesh. So, is another franchise in Chennai on the cards? “As of now, we are working on streamlining our operations in this outlet and also tracking the response. Something might materialise in the future,” adds Jinesh.

Heart disease occurs when plaque builds up within artery walls blocking the blood flow through tissues in the body, increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

About 630,000 people die each year from heart disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While there is no singular cure for heart disease, there are numerous forms of treatment including lifestyle changes and surgical procedures. In one procedure called a coronary angioplasty, a surgeon inserts and inflates a tiny balloon inside a blocked or narrow artery to widen it and allow blood to flow through to the heart thereby decreasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

This procedure often includes inserting a permanent small mesh tube to support the blood vessel called a stent.

Commercial stents can release chemotherapy agents that are toxic and can cause the blood vessel to narrow again. LSU Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences Professor Tammy Dugas is developing a new stent that releases red wine antioxidants slowly over time that promotes healing and prevents blood clotting and inflammation. The two antioxidant compounds are resveratrol and quercetin.

""By delivering red wine antioxidants during conventional angioplasty, it may be possible to prevent excess tissue from building up and the blood vessel from narrowing again as it heals,"" Dr. Dugas said.

In addition to the stent, Dugas and colleagues are developing a balloon coated with the same compounds to treat blood flow blockages throughout the body called peripheral artery disease.

Drug-coated balloons are a relatively new product, and are being developed to help interventional cardiologists treat arteries that are difficult to target with traditional angioplasty and stent treatments.","WASHINGTON: Researchers are developing a new stent that releases red wine antioxidants slowly over time that promotes healing and prevents blood clotting and inflammation.

Veganism is the hottest food trend in Israel,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/jan/17/veganism-is-the-hottest-food-trend-in-israel-1756344.html,"Wednesday, January 17, 2018 01:07 PM +0530","HAFIFA: Amira, a housewife belonging to the Druze community, is busy chopping vegetables in her home in Dalyat el Carmel, a serene and quaint town in the Carmel mountains near Israel's Haifa city. It takes her about an hour to roll out five vegan Middle Eastern dishes which are fresh and healthy. Veganism has gained popularity in Israel and is a growing trend.



Most of the ingredients used by Amira are there in an Indian kitchen and this came to me as a surprise. Vegan food in Israel is very diverse and there is a lot of creativity in the way dishes are prepared at homes and in restaurants. Israel has culinary influences from all around the world.



Amira's made-at-home food, served with warmth and eagerness, also allowed me to get a peek into the Druze culture that has its origins in 10th century in Egypt. It's an offshoot of Islam that draws inspiration from Islamic and other philosophies. The Druze are a close-knit community and believe in reincarnation and pre-determination and do not permit conversion.



Dalyat el Carmel, which has an undulating terrain with neatly laid out houses, is the world's southernmost settlement of the Druze community and the largest in Israel.



I helped Amira with chopping some vegetable during my cooking workshop and then ate the stuff she cooked -- vine leaves, freekeh (smoked green wheat), tabouli, mnazaleh (eggplant and chickpeas in tomato sauce) and cauliflower sinye, besides stuffed eggplant and zucchinis.



I particularly liked the cauliflower sinye with its lingering taste of garlic. The dish needs some delicate cooking using ingredients such as onions, baharat spice mix (garam masala), tahini (raw sesame paste) and lemon.



As I left her home, Amira's husband Waggi brought me some garden fresh fruit as a kind of send-off for my vegetarian trail ahead in Israel in which I discovered seemingly endless variety of meatless dishes.



At ""Phyllis' Kitchen"" (her home) in Tel Aviv, the ingredients had been picked with great care for that extra dash of freshness. Phyllis Glazer, an American-born food journalist, is the author of several cookbooks, including a pioneering vegetarian cookbook which was translated into Hebrew.



Phyllis explained the recipes as she cooked and talked about the vegan movement in Israel and in her city of Tel Aviv, which is regarded as the vegan capital of the world.



""Tel Aviv is considered one of the centres of the vegan world. Vegan food is everywhere. Every restaurant has a vegan option. Veganism is the latest hottest trend in Israel right now and has been for the last three to five years, mostly in reaction to the killing of animals, but also because it is considered healthy,"" she said.



Phyllis said many of the mezze dishes (part of the dining experience in Eastern Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Arab countries) are vegan because ""that's how they make them any way"".



""But 40 years ago veganism was very rare, and vegetarian food was considered basically for odd people. When I came to Israel 40 years ago, I brought with me the coolness of the American vegetarian kitchen and soon generations of Israelis adopted it,"" she said.



An estimated five percent of Israelis are vegans and over eight percent vegetarians.



Easy availability of vegan and vegetarian food in Israel makes travelling so much easier for people looking for these options. In Israel, vegan food is also coming up as a niche tourism area with vegan culinary tours of Tel Aviv and vegan group tours of Israel. Dominos launched vegan pizzas in Israel in 2013.



Cooking is a passion for Phyllis and her effort of about an hour produced dishes that I could not resist overeating. There were hummus and mushrooms, mini sabih (street food), pink tahina (gets its colour from beet), Georgian stuffed peppers, green shakshuka and roasted eggplant and pomegranate salad.



While there is no match to home-cooked food, I also enjoyed eating out. At Nanuchka, one of the most famous vegan restaurants in Tel Aviv, an enduring story is how its owner Nana Shrier became a vegan and stopped serving meat and animal products at her restaurant from 2014, defying those who predicted it will not be successful.



Adi Cohen Simantov, an Israeli food blogger, said Challenge 22+, a 22-day vegan experience supported by a Facebook group, has contributed to people turning vegans.



""It is a closed group on Facebook that helps you become vegan. There are dieticians, cooking experts who address any question,"" she said.



In restaurants such as Douzan in the coastal city of Haifa, there were vegan options to choose from a huge menu. So was it at Bakery Roladin in Jerusalem.



Abigail Leichman, a journalist, who has written on vegan movement in Israel, said the country has a lot of groups that are active in educating people about eating vegan and about animal welfare.



""They have seen pictures and videos about the factory farming industry revealing the cruelty involved in the production of meat, poultry, milk and eggs,"" she said.



""We have such good fruits and vegetables here and a lot of traditional dishes are already vegetarian or vegan like tahini and hummus. As they are already used to eating those dishes, it is not such a big change for them to take a vegan or vegetarian way,"" she added.","Vegan food in Israel is very diverse and there is a lot of creativity in the way dishes are prepared at homes and in restaurants.

(Photo: AP)

MOSHAV IDAN: They say bigger is better, but in the succulent world of cherry tomatoes, one Israeli company is going smaller than ever before.

The ""drop tomato"" is about the size of a blueberry and the Kedma company in the country's southern Arava desert says it is the smallest one ever cultivated in Israel, perhaps even in the world. It's a point of pride in a country known for its agricultural innovation, where fruits and vegetables are taken seriously and where several strands of the cherry tomato were first invented.

""The idea is that it is comfortable,"" said Ariel Kidron, a Kedma grower. ""You can throw it in a salad, you don't need to cut it. It just explodes in your mouth.""

The seed, originally developed in Holland, was modified to match the arid growing conditions in southern Israel. Rami Golan, of the Central and Northern Arava Research and Development center, who accompanied the project, said it was definitely the smallest ever to be grown in Israel — where tomatoes are incredibly popular.

The tiny tomato, smaller than a one shekel Israeli coin, is offered in red and yellow varieties and will be presented to the public at a three-day international agricultural fair in Israel later this month. Early indications are it could be a big hit.

Shaul Ben Aderet, a well-known Israeli chef who owns three restaurants, including Tel Aviv's ""Blue Rooster,"" got some early samples and says the new strand is packed with flavor and will spawn an infinite number of new recipes. He offered it sizzled in a pan, baked into focaccia bread and as a straight-up snack.

""It's very simple, it's clean, it's nice, it's sexy,"" he said. In a blind taste test alongside two sweets, he said, ""they would say the tomato is a candy, that's for sure.""","In this Thursday, Jan. 4, 2018 photo, small yellow and red 'drop tomatoes' are spawning new recipes at a restaurant in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Best of Bihar,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/jan/06/best-of-bihar-1744816.html,"Saturday, January 6, 2018 04:08 PM +0530","A major in economics, Pallavi Nigam Sahay was settled with a well-paying job in a leading insurance company, but love for food and passion for cooking led her to do a culinary diploma from the Italian Culinary Institute for Foreigners, and in the process, she ended up cooking up a surprise. “My classmates were working in the financial sector, and I too opted for it, least realising that it doesn’t excite or make me happy. I wasn’t the type to toss up data, mix up numbers and create theories. But I was passionate about cooking since childhood. So one fine day, I quit my job and joined a culinary course to become a chef,” says the chef, who is in her 30s.

It was her undying love for regional food that made her write a book celebrating the cuisines from Bihar, The Bhojpuri Kitchen. It was released in October last. She relied on her mom-in-law Jyotsna to author this book to bring the best of Bhojpuri kitchen—from comfort food, festival fares to sumptuous snacks, curries and bhujias (pan-roasted vegetables) to saags, pickles, chutneys, and sweet delicacies—to join the ranks of other regional cookbooks. “Not many people know, but we have food for all reasons and seasons. When it comes to food from the twin states, people mostly know of litti-chokha, but there’s a lot more to explore. The gastronomic range is a sheer delight for a foodie and nothing but pure bliss,” she says.

Sahay was trained at Grand Hyatt (Mumbai) and Trattoria Maddalena (Italy), and is today based out of Muscat, where she works as an independent food consultant with popular restaurant groups in the Middle East and India.Her expertise lies in redesigning recipes to suit the modern palate with ingredients that are easily available to home cooks. She hosted Working Women’s Kitchen Series on Sanjeev Kapoor’s YouTube channel, Khazana. “The series was based on the concept that in spite of being busy, anyone can cook themselves a nice healthy meal, which doesn’t always have to be regular items, but can be gourmet meals too, from paneer pasta to chicken casserole, shrimp linguine and sheesh tawook,” says Sahay.

Her easy-to-make, quick and healthy recipes are quite popular among food enthusiasts, and she was ranked among the Top 9 YouTube chefs in April last year.

A popular face on YouTube channels, Sahay has worked with India Food Network on Kissan Tiffin Timetable Project for which she cooked a delicious surprise from Potato & Cheese Roesti, Roti & Rice Burrito, Baked Cheese & Mushroom Pinwheels to Veggie Paneer Croquettes, Kidney Beans Burger and Instant Paella, for fussy eaters.

Rising popularity of organic foods: What you should know,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/jan/04/rising-popularity-of-organic-foods-what-you-should-know-1744246.html,"Thursday, January 4, 2018 11:46 AM +0530","NEW DELHI: The demand for organic foods began with fruits and vegetables when there were reports of pesticide residues in them. However, the popularity of organic foods has now extended to food grains, pulses, tea, spices and even oilseeds.

“Organic foods have gained popularity because people have become aware of their benefits. They contain no chemical pesticides and fertilizers and are grown naturally with manure or compost and only natural pesticides and insecticides are used,” said Dr. Saurabh Arora, MD (Auriga research and Director at Arbro Pharmaceuticals) and Founder of Food Safety Helpline.

“Children are more susceptible than adults to diseases caused by chemical pesticide residues in food and so parents prefer to give them organic foods. Another advantage is that organic foods do not contain growth hormones or antibiotic residues. Animals are often given growth hormones and antibiotics in animal feeds which are directly passed into animal foods like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products and from foods to the consumers. In organic farming these practices are banned and animals feed outside in natural surroundings. Antibiotic containing foods consumed frequently makes these antibiotics ineffective in humans,” he added.

Organic food products are either grown under a natural system of agriculture, without the use of synthetic fertilizers or they are processed products made from organically produced raw materials.

“Therefore, any food offered for sale as 'organic food' in India, needs to comply with the provisions laid down under either the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) administered by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) or the Participatory Guarantee System for India (PGS-India) operated by the ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. There are a number of organic brands that use the term ‘organic” on labels but if these products are not certified then their authenticity is suspect,” said Arora.

According to the Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) such foods that are labelled organic but not certified cannot be considered safe. The ICRIER also mentioned the need for a uniform standard for organic foods in its last report.

Now, the Food Safety Standards and Authority of India (FSSAI) has launched the Food Safety and Standards (Organic Foods) Regulations 2017 along with the unified logo for organic food products, supported with the tagline “Jaivik Bharat.”

All organic foods certified under this logo also need to convey the full and accurate information on labels about the organic status of the food. The ‘Jaivik Bharat’ logo will henceforth be recognised as a mark of the quality assurance given by the above-mentioned certification bodies in India or any other bodies recognised by FSSAI.","NEW DELHI: The demand for organic foods began with fruits and vegetables when there were reports of pesticide residues in them.
However, the popularity of organic foods has now extended to food grains, pulses, tea, spices and even oilseeds.

How climate change may transform taste of wines,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/jan/03/how-climate-change-may-transform-taste-of-wines-1743568.html,"Wednesday, January 3, 2018 05:34 PM +0530","BOSTON: Climate change may cause popular wines to taste different, forcing winemakers to plant lesser- known grape varieties to counteract some of the effects of global warming.

Scientists and vintners need to better understand the wide diversity of grapes and their adaptions to different climates, according to Elizabeth Wolkovich, assistant professor at Harvard University in the US.

""It's going to be very hard for many regions to continue growing the exact varieties they've grown in the past,"" Wolkovich said.

""The Old World has a huge diversity of winegrapes - there are over planted 1,000 varieties - and some of them are better adapted to hotter climates and have higher drought tolerance than the 12 varieties now making up over 80 per cent of the wine market in many countries,"" she said.

""We should be studying and exploring these varieties to prepare for climate change,"" she added.

Convincing wine producers to try different grape varieties is difficult at best, and the reason often comes down to the current concept of terroir - the notion that a wine's flavour is a reflection of where, which and how the grapes were grown.

As currently understood, only certain traditional or existing varieties are part of each terroir, leaving little room for change.

Even if winemakers were open to switching to new varieties, researchers do not have enough data to say whether other varieties would be able to adapt to climate change.

""Right now we know we have this diversity, but we have little information on how to use it,"" said Ignacio Morales- Castilla, from Harvard University.

""One of our other suggestions is for growers to start setting aside parts of vineyards to grow some other varieties to see which ones are working,"" said Castilla, who investigates which winegrape varieties will adequately mature where under climate change.

Even if researchers came to the table armed with information about grape diversity, Wolkovich said the industry still faces hurdles when it comes to making changes.

In Europe, growers have more than 1,000 grape varieties to choose from, research repositories such as INRA's Domaine de Vassal that study this diversity, and expertise in how to grow different varieties.

Yet strict labelling laws have created restrictions on their ability to take advantage of this diversity.

For example, just three varieties of grapes can be labelled as Champagne or four for Burgundy.

Similar restrictions have been enacted in many European regions - all of which force growers to focus on a small handful of grape varieties.

""The more you are locked into what you have to grow, the less room you have to adapt to climate change,"" Wolkovich said.","BOSTON: Climate change may cause popular wines to taste different, forcing winemakers to plant lesser- known grape varieties to counteract some of the effects of global warming.

Chocolate likely to get extinct in 30 years,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/jan/02/chocolate-likely-to-get-extinct-in-30-years-1742708.html,"Tuesday, January 2, 2018 07:48 PM +0530","LONDON: With warmer global temperatures and dryer weather conditions threatening the survival of the fragile cocoa plant, which could see chocolate disappear by as early as 2050, scientists are exploring the possibility of using the gene-editing technology CRISPR to evolve crops that can survive environmental challenges.

Scientists from the University of California are teaming up with food and candy company Mars to explore CRISPR technique to help tiny cocao seedlings to survive and thrive in the dryer, warmer climate, Businessinsider.com reported.

Experts have warned that increase in warmer global temperatures and dryer weather conditions could see chocolate disappear by as early as 2050.

The cacao tree -- which produces cocoa beans -- can only grow within a narrow strip of rain forested land roughly 20 degrees north and south of the Equator, where temperature, rain, and humidity all stay relatively constant throughout the year.

However, the fragile plant is under threat from diseases and a changing climate that will suck moisture from the soil and make it impossible to produce a good crop in many regions around the world by 2050, the Sun reported.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, by 2050 the rising temperatures will push the chocolate-growing regions of the world more than 1,000 feet uphill into mountainous terrain -- much of which is currently preserved for wildlife.

The problem is most cocoa is produced by poor families who cannot afford fertilisers and pesticides, the experts noted.

""More than 90 per cent of the global cocoa crop is produced by smallholders on subsistence farms with unimproved planting material,"" Doug Hawkins, of Hardman Agribusiness -- a London based capital markets advisory services firm -- was quoted as saying to the Sun.

""All the indicators are that we could be looking at a chocolate deficit of 100,000 tons a year in the next few years,"" Hawkins added.","Scientists from the University of California are teaming up with food and candy company Mars to explore CRISPR technique to help tiny cocao seedlings to survive and thrive in the dryer, warmer climate, Businessinsider.com reported.

Devour the flavourful black/Kadaknath chicken at Desi Di,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2018/jan/02/devour-the-flavourful-blackkadaknath-chicken-at-desi-di-1742295.html,"Tuesday, January 2, 2018 11:54 AM +0530","CHENNAI: Imagine chicken meat that is black in colour and is cooked and served in Chettinad cuisine style.



Well, guests at the Desi Di restaurant who order the Tamil Roast Kadaknath Chicken certainly wait in anticipation for the dish after hearing a brief introduction about the black chicken meat.



""Kadaknath Chicken is an Indian breed mainly found in Madhya Pradesh. The bird is completely black -- not only its plumage but also its meat, legs. Said to be rich in protein and low in cholesterol, the flavour-full black chicken meat is said to have several medicinal properties,"" Chef Aaron Coutinho told IANS.



It takes a lot of guts for a young chef to try out something that is entirely off-beat at a new restaurant and Coutinho seems to be game for such an activity with his special chicken preparation in Chettinad style.



By this time, Desi Di's special red hibiscus iced tea in a tall beaker arrived at the table and it was soon followed by the ""hero"" of the Christmas menu that's available till January 7 -- Tamil Roast Kadaknath Chicken.



The pepper chicken dish was served with two small buns along with a small cup with the pepper gravy.



""We wanted to keep out all other flavours so that the guest enjoys the flavour of the black chicken meat. Nobody in our team had tasted this meat and we were sure of success,"" Coutinho said.



While the meat is really flavourful, the surprise element is its toughness, but after the second bite one gets used to it.



""The chicken's breast portion is similar to other country chicken but the leg meat has a strong chicken flavour,"" Coutinho added.



The bun also went well with the gravy but it will be better to have rice mixed with the gravy and the chicken meat to bite into.



""We do market visits. Two months back we had been to a suburban market where we found the Kadaknath chicken. We tried various cooking styles with one chicken and finally arrived at this,"" Coutinho said pointing to the dish on the plate.



""A pair cost us around Rs 2,800 and we had to be careful,"" he added.



According to him, the meat is marinated for 4-6 hours.



""It is a well-prepared dish. The flavour was excellent and the masala was also perfect,"" Yogita Uchil, a guest at the restaurant, told IANS.



""After hearing Coutinho briefing about the chicken, we were mentally tuned and ready to see black meat chicken on our table,"" added her husband Harsha Raj, an IT consultant.



Desi Di's Christmas special menu also includes Goan Turkey cafreal with Tossed Potatoes and Gongura Fish/Prawn Moilee with Appam.



Uchil, a foodie, pointed out that the Mizoram Super Spicy Beef and Bamboo Shoot curry with Sticky Rice were awesome.



For the sweet tooth, there's Bebinca with orange sauce or slice of plum cake.

The various shades of tea to devour this winter,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/dec/17/the-various-shades-of-tea-to-devour-this-winter-1729630.html,"Sunday, December 17, 2017 03:26 PM +0530","NEW DELHI: Waking up on a chilly morning to a hot cup of tea is therapeutic. Depending on the oxidation level, tea can be classified into five main types. Moreover, the less a tea is oxidized, the gentler and lighter it will be in taste and aroma.

For those who love their morning cuppa, here is a peek into the various shades of tea and the many reasons why this love affair should continue

1. White Tea

White Tea is the least processed version of tea offering delicate flavours and aroma. It is rich in antibacterial properties and is instrumental in lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. Due to its low caffeine content, it is also the perfect choice for people wanting to cut down on their caffeine intake.

Moreover, due to a high phenol content, it strengthens elastin and collagen which helps in preventing wrinkles and aids acne treatment.

Weight loss tip: For people wanting to lose weight, a concoction of 1 teaspoon of white leaves, ½ teaspoon ginger powder and few drops of lemon juice, taken regularly for 15 days will show promising results.

Recommended dosage: 3-4 cups daily

2. Green Tea

Green Tea is high in anti-oxidants, and promotes a healthy cell growth. It also helps to reduce cholesterol. However, to get the maximum benefits from green tea, one should avoid adding milk, sugar, cream and even honey to it.

It is best to brew a spoonful of fresh tea leaves in boiling water and steep for 2-3 minutes before one drinks it.

Beauty benefits: When mixed with sugar, green tea can be used as a face scrub. It is also an excellent toner, which helps to open clogged pores. Green Tea is a good choice to reduce puffiness around the eyes and can be used as a hair rinse for healthy hair.

Recommended dosage: 2- 3 cups daily

3. Black Tea

Black tea is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, and helps to reduce the risk of heart diseases.

It also lowers sugar levels in the body.

Beauty benefits: Ideal for people with oily skin, black tea helps to tighten pores, freshens up skin and gives one a natural, radiant glow. A secret recipe for a naturally toned and cellulite free body, is bathing with black tea twice a week.

4. Rooibos/Herbal Tea

Rooibos or Herbal tea is free from caffeine and low in tannin content.

It also has cancer fighting properties and is beneficial against skin allergies.

Beauty benefits: To use it as a natural mild cleanser, cool and apply the brewed tea on the skin. Dry for 10 minutes and rinse off. It reduces acne, scars, pimples, swelling and redness.

5. Oolong Tea

Oolong tea is rich in antioxidants. It is also a good source of calcium, manganese, potassium, copper and selenium.

The tea is also instrumental in weight management and controlling tooth decay.

Beauty benefits: Oolong Tea keeps skin healthy and clearer. For those suffering from eczema, or just want a brighter, younger looking skin, 2-3 cups of Oolong tea is highly recommended. It diminishes dark spots, age spots and wrinkles. It is also an effective sunscreen and toner.","However, to get the maximum benefits from green tea, one should avoid adding milk, sugar, cream and even honey to it.

Cup of hot tea a day can keep glaucoma away,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/dec/15/cup-of-hot-tea-a-day-can-keep-glaucoma-away-1728093.html,"Friday, December 15, 2017 04:59 PM +0530","WASHINGTON: Tea lovers rejoice! New research shows drinking a cup of hot tea at least once a day can lower the risk of developing glaucoma, a serious eye condition.

But drinking decaffeinated and caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated tea, iced tea and soft drinks doesn't seem to make any difference to glaucoma risk, the findings show.

Glaucoma causes fluid pressure to build up inside the eye (intraocular pressure), damaging the optic nerve. It is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, and currently affects 57.5 million people, and is expected to increase to 65.5 million by 2020.

Previous research suggests that caffeine can alter intraocular pressure, but no study so far has compared the potential impact of decaffeinated and caffeinated drinks on glaucoma risk.

So the researchers looked at data from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the US. This is a nationally representative annual survey of around 10, 000 people that includes interviews, physical examinations, and blood samples, designed to gauge the health and nutritional status of US adults and children.

In this particular year, it also included eye tests for glaucoma. Among the 1678 participants who had full eye test results, including photos, 84 (5%) adults had developed the condition.

They were asked how often and how much they had drunk of caffeinated and decaffeinated drinks, including soft drinks and iced tea, over the preceding 12 months, using a validated questionnaire (Food Frequency).

Compared with those who didn't drink hot tea every day, those who did, had a lower glaucoma risk, the data showed.

After taking account of potentially influential factors, such as diabetes and smoking, hot tea-drinkers were 74 per cent less likely to have glaucoma.

But no such associations were found for coffee--caffeinated or decaffeinated--decaffeinated tea, iced tea or soft drinks.

This is an observational study so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, and the absolute numbers of those with glaucoma were small. Information on when glaucoma had been diagnosed was also unavailable.

Nor did the survey ask about factors like cup size, tea type, or the length of brewing time, all of which might have been influential.

But tea contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective chemicals, which have been associated with a lowered risk of serious conditions, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, say the researchers.

The findings have been published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.","New research shows drinking a cup of hot tea at least once a day can lower the risk of developing glaucoma, a serious eye condition.

Entrepreneurs are not shying from bringing innovative ideas to the business. The up and coming Ahmedabad is no exception.

Sanjali Nirwani, 28, who runs the Unlocked Café, says, “My friends and I used to go to cafes in cities like Amsterdam, where we could play board games and try our hands at puzzles. When I returned to India, I decided to start a similar café in my home city.”

This is what led to the birth of Unlocked Café in 2017. It was conceptualised with motifs of pawns and pieces adorning the walls, along with lounge style furniture ideal for relaxing and playing games.

“I have built a library of about 100 board games for the cafe. While waiting for their food to come, patrons can play games like Scrabble or Pictionary free-of-cost,” says Sanjali. For serious board game enthusiasts, there are games like Quattro, Catan, Forbidden Island, Puerto Rico, Agricola, and A Game of Thrones—these are charged by the hour. The café also has an Escape Room, where players have to solve puzzles and undertake other activities that will lead to unlocking the room.

While the library is Unlocked’s USP, Sanjali says they have worked hard on the menu too. “We have finger foods, crepes, waffles, sandwiches and egg dishes. For those who want something more substantial, there are Indian, Western, Mediterranean and Pan-Asian cuisines,” says Sanjali, who studied and worked in Europe for many years.

Cajun Spiced Cottage Cheese Picatta, Assorted Spanish Pintxos and Chicken Parmigia are their signature dishes. While Sanjali’s board game café is a reflection of her passion, 49-year-old Suresh Nair’s Caffix—the Tech Café is an extension of his technology business. “After completing MSc in 1989, I started working in an IT company and have been working in the field since then. I became a distributor of Apple products four years ago. With it, I wanted to set up a workshop for smartphone, laptop and tablet repairs. But I found that most of the service centres looked clinical, like hospitals,” he says.

Customers were not comfortable sitting in them while waiting for their gadgets to be repaired. This led to his idea of a café, which was started this year. “Techno-fiends and clients, who come here to source parts or accessories, or get something repaired, end up having a coffee or snacks,” he says. Apart from this, there are people who just come here for a coffee or even a milkshake. “Our USP is our coffee printer—using edible ink we print photographs of the patron or any visual they want on the coffee surface. People love it. Besides, the multi-layered Twisted Pizza is the signature dish of Caffix,” he says.

Suresh and his partner are now looking for more locations in and around Ahmedabad to open Caffix branches. For Darshan Rawal, it was his passion for food and cooking that led him to start a small pizzeria called Café Soho. A larger version of his existing café called Soho Ilferno is expected to open this month. “I have lived much of my life in New York. My businesses brought me back to Ahmedabad, where I had schooled,” he says.

When Darshan was looking at opportunities to enter the food service business, a small place came up for rent in 2014, and he seized on the chance to become the head chef, manager and the owner. “I named it Soho after a neighborhood in New York City that is known for its dining, shopping and art scene,” he says. A certified pizza maker, Darshan decided to specialise in New York-style pizza, with a characteristically large hand-tossed thin crust cut into wide slices. “Since the water and weather is different in Ahmedabad as opposed to New York, I had to develop the recipe for making the dough and use imported bread flour for these pizzas,” he says.

At first, selling this pizza in Ahmedabad was a challenge for him as diners had not tried foldable pizzas and had pre-conceived notions of how a pizza should be. “Also, I had to experiment with toppings, since just offering what New York’s pizzas had was not enough to appeal to the local palate. I introduced Indian toppings too.

Today, business is good and many corporate houses, families and individuals have become my patrons,” says the 37-year-old. While the pizzeria is pure vegetarian in keeping with the neighbourhood it is in, his upcoming café will have non-vegetarian toppings too. “I am looking forward to offering pizzas from different parts of the world at Soho Ilferno.” So, if you are a true-blue café freak in Ahmedabad, you know where you should be heading.

Drink your way to a smarter you with wine,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/dec/09/drink-your-way-to-a-smarter-you-with-wine-1722818.html,"Saturday, December 9, 2017 03:31 PM +0530","LONDON: You would have probably heard that red wine is good for health, right? And now here's another reason to raise a toast as according to an expert, it can also make your brain function more efficiently.

According to Yale neuroscientist, Gordon Shepherd, drinking wine stimulates more grey matter in the brain than solving math equations, reports the Independent.

In his book, ‘Neuroenology: How the Brain Creates the Taste of Wine’, Shepherd said that the process of drinking and interpreting wine is a complex and nuanced one.

This includes the way in which you sip the wine, how your tongue moves the wine around in your mouth, how your nose responds to the aroma of wine and so on.

While talking about his book, Shepherd shared, “You don’t just put wine in your mouth and leave it there. You move it about and then swallow it, which is a very complex motor act.”

The brain plays a very important role in deciphering the taste of wine. Shepherd likened it to the way our eyes perceive colours.

“The analogy one can use is colour. The objects we see don’t have colour themselves - light hits them and bounces off,” noted Shephard.

He further said, “It’s when light strikes our eyes that it activates systems in the brain that create colour from those different wavelengths. Similarly, the molecules in wine don’t have taste or flavour, but when they stimulate our brain, the brain creates flavour the same way it creates colour.”","According to Yale neuroscientist, Gordon Shepherd, drinking wine stimulates more grey matter in the brain than solving math equations, reports the Independent.

Asked the reason for his liking, Madhu says, “It is light on the stomach. And the food has a different taste.”

Anjappar special chicken

Founded by the late Anjappar in the early 1960s, the Kochi restaurant is the 79th outlet of the chain spread across the world. Anjappar restaurants are in the US, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, while, in India, the majority are in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Puducherry. Food and Beverages Head S Gandhinathan says their base is black pepper and spices, instead of powdered masala. “To get the best spices, we buy from wholesalers instead of retail outlets. And to maintain the quality, we grind spices on our own. Our USP is that we use different spices for every dish,” he says.

So, for the mutton sukka dish, cinnamon, cloves, pepper and cumin are used. But for chicken dishes, it is chilli and coriander. Other spices include star aniseed, tamarind, fennel seeds, fenugreek, curry leaves and peppercorn.

“We also use a lot of shallots (small onions),” says Gandhinathan. “It enhances the taste of dishes.” For a first-time visitor, there is an initial feeling of the food being a bit hot, but gradually the taste grows on you. And, indeed, at the end of the meal, you don’t feel heavy at all.

King Fish Tawa Fry

According to Gandhinathan, the most popular dishes are the special Chettinad meals, and different varieties of dum biryani—chicken, fish, prawn and mutton. “In fact, our biryani is very popular abroad,” he says. And we opened the first in Kerala this year, says Gandhinathan.

Mollywood stars, including Aju Varghese, Mamta Mohandas, Asif Ali and Vineeth Sreenivasan, and former cricketer S Sreesanth are regulars here. “In our comments book, Sreesanth once wrote, ‘Amazing food and service’,” says Gandhinathan.

When founder Anjappar left his village Ponnamaravathy in Tamil Nadu in the 1950s, and shifted to Chennai, to better his economic prospects, little could he have imagined that his life would turn out the way it did.

Founder late Anjappar

What helped was Anjappar’s natural talent of cooking and a fateful meeting with the colossus of Tamil Nadu—actor MG Ramachandran. Anjappar was providing food to the crew on the sets of his film. “MGR sir liked Anjappar sir’s food so much that he immediately hired him as his personal chef,” says Gandhinathan. Thereafter, he worked in MGR’s kitchen for 20 years.

Then, with the blessings of the superstar, he ventured out and started his first restaurant in Royapettah in 1964. And never looked back. The success story goes on. Anjappar passed away on January 7, 2001. But his sons—Kandasamy and Maruthu Pandian—are now running the show. “We are focused on expanding our chain,” says Kandasamy. With their unique taste, success seems to be assured.

The winter elixir,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/dec/02/the-winter-elixir-1715198.html,"Thursday, November 30, 2017 10:30 PM +0530","Recently, when pollution hit an alarmingly high level, just like last year, we hit an even higher note of concern. And, just like the previous year, the government did squat about it. So we all set ourselves to finding cures for it. From helping in skyrocketing the sales of air purifiers to stuffing our houses with camphor and snake plants to the rafters, and gulping down jaggery by the kilo, we did everything in an effort to keep our lungs somewhat healthy or at best, least diseased.

Another natural product I turned to was honey, if not to fight pollution but at least to keep my cough at bay. Honey mixed with roasted ginger and black pepper is the best grandma’s cure for a cough, one that now finds scientific backing to suggest it may be even better than certain cough syrups in the market.

Don’t forget that honey is essentially stored bee food so it is naturally high in calories but it can still be marginally healthier than sugar, especially for diabetics. Sure honey isn’t quite the vitamin and mineral source (or fat, fibre and protein source) that many marketing claims make it out to be but it is rich in certain plant-origin bio-active compounds, which are good for us. It is also rich in antioxidants, an idea that is the single most important revenue-churner for the ‘reverse ageing’ cosmetic industry. But more than just reducing wrinkles, antioxidants can reduce chances of heart-related issues, and can even be anti-carcinogenic. It lowers LDL and blood pressure—two things that are good to sustain a healthy heart.

Clearly, the extra calories that honey brings to the mix are easily offset by the benefits it provides. So how does one choose a good brand?

Well, organic certification is always a good measure but it is an expensive one. So many producers may prefer to save the change and invest it in ensuring healthier beehives. One way to do this is the same way as McDonald’s does it, choosing the right location. The higher one goes in altitude, the more verdant and nature-rich the surroundings become, which allow bees’ access to better raw material. So you can have honey from all sorts of flowers to fruits like the Indian blackberry or even mustard.

Purity is a concern but don’t bother doing the burn test or the ‘does it hold shape when poured into water’ one. Most honey brands will ensure compliance there. Bees can make honey even in crowded cities but the quality isn’t great. Maintaining hives in high altitude farms is costly so when you see honey priced differently, apart from the pretty packaging, you may be paying for the difficult sourcing costs being incurred by the maker.

Sadly I don’t know much about reliable brands out there. Beechworth honey from Victoria in Australia remains a high reference point for me and every honey I try is compared against them. Locally, Societe Naturelle is made by a very health-conscious marathoner friend, who supplied me with some versions. It was much richer than any of the big brands out there. But expensive is not always better. Smaller producers stand a better chance of cornering this market. The writer is a sommelier.

A barrel of beauty,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/nov/25/a-barrel-of-beauty-1709381.html,"Saturday, November 25, 2017 06:19 PM +0530","Half-timbered houses with sloping roofs, cobbled lanes and sycamore trees, large signs crafted out of metal and wood, window boxes bursting with blooms, walls covered with vintage murals, shops with wooden toys, nutcracker men and nativity figurines. I am in Rudesheim am Rhein, a small town in the scenic area of Rhinegau, a small strip of land bordering the Rhine, in Germany, surrounded by vineyards on terraced slopes.

Long ago, Rudesheim was a wealthy vineyard town, and made its money from wine-making and shipping. Soon after the town, there is a bend in the Rhine river, so Rudesheim became a popular spot to change boats, unload goods, and rest the horses. “Today the population of the town is only around 10,000 but we have 1.5 million tourists per year,” says guide Sebastian Eickenbusch. Most of the visitors are those who land here on a river cruise down the Rhine.

The south-facing slopes surrounding the town get many hours of sunshine, and this is home to the finest Riesling wines. Wine-making has been a tradition here since Roman times and today most vineyards are family-owned. Every summer the town has a wine festival when a wine queen and her princesses are crowned to represent the town.

The centre of all action in town is the narrow cobbled street called Drosselgasse, lined with wine and beer taverns, souvenir shops and open-air restaurants that buzz with revelry throughout the day. “Long ago it was the path used by boat owners to move goods to their homes,” explains Eickenbusch. As evening progresses, groups of people sitting on terraces start singing and dancing to music by brass bands, and singers belting old classics. Glockenspiel bells made of porcelain ring every half-an-hour, with a parade of figurines, and remain another tourist attraction.

Cable car ride to Germania monument

My home away from home is the Hotel Linderwirt, where I have a lovely room overlooking the terrace and the busy Drosselgasse. If you are adventurous, you can even choose one of its six special rooms, made from converted wine barrels. Eickenbusch recommends we do the Ring Tour that takes you in a circuit through the vineyards, to the towering Germania monument, then to the red wine town of Assmannhausen and finally a boat ride on the Rhine, back to the town.

Taking the cable car, we get a unique view as we float over the geometric rows of the vineyards reaching the top of a hill, with panoramic views over the Rhine Valley. We walk to the gargantuan Germania monument—a German ‘Statue of Liberty’ with a woman holding a crown and a sword—which was erected in 1871, after Germany became a unified state for the first time.

We continue from the monument, doing a three-kilometre trek through a thick beech and oak forest. This is located in a national reserve which was developed by Count Ostein, in the late 1800s. On the way back we take the chair lift to the village of Assmanshausen, which is the only area that grows red wine in these parts. It’s a tranquil downhill ride passing through the homes of locals, sliding over their terraces and peering into their living rooms, down to the town. We walk to the pier and take a boat back to Rudesheim, enjoying the views over the Rhine.

The highlight of the meals is the Rudesheimer coffee made with locally produced Asbach Brandy, flambéed and mixed with coffee, whipped cream and grated chocolate. Before I leave town, I visit Siegfried’s mechanical cabinet Museum. This quirky museum showcases the owner’s collection of self-playing musical instruments ranging from tiny music boxes and mechanical violins, to orchestras. It harks back to an era when people created music without electricity, with just their mechanical skills! It’s a feast for the senses, like everything else in Rudesheim.

Plateful of warmth,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/nov/25/plateful-of-warmth-1709393.html,"Saturday, November 25, 2017 06:19 PM +0530","He is the toast of the urban culinary circuit on home turf. Winter is here and Manu Chandra has begun serving up extra warmth in a bowl for the soul through the One Bowl Winter meals at Monkey Bar across Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata. The hot pan-Indian menu has 12 soul-warming comfort food recipes, ranging from sesame teriyake chicken bowl to prawn pad Thai noodles and seafood linguinesee, for you to relish when the chill fills the air.

Manu Chandra

On a rapid, pan-India eatery expansion spree, the creative heart behind the trio of superb restaurants—The Fatty Bao, Toast & Tonic and Monkey Bar—Chef Chandra means serious business as he spins out winsome specials from this kitchen in his signature, mince-no-words style.

So with three bustling chains of smashing restobars, is Chandra cracking it cool? “Well, we are making money. But honestly, I do not think I have nailed it per se. In my mind, I have tried to offer the best cuisine at the best price. As chef partner at these restaurants, it is viable for me to serve up great food at nominal prices, without pricing myself out of the market,” he says.

Fair enough, but the triad seems to have got the dynamics right: from the edgy decor to noveau small plates to sassed-up, boozy cocktails. Monkey Bar hits bull’s-eye with the spender shell-out of `700-900 per person, Toast & Tonic with `1,500 per person, with Fatty at around `800 per person. “I always feel price is an instrument of economy. It is tough to run a restaurant without a sizeable quantum flowing in. Everything needs to be taken into account, including the rent and salaries. The plan is to achieve high revenue during the first year, then break even.”

About the new bowl menu, he says, “Bowl meals are my all-time favourite. The one bowl meal finds inspiration from Asian cuisines as the bowl is perfectly suited for dishes like ramens, soups and noodles.”

It ain’t been all easy. With the recently opened Delhi Fatty initially whimpering at the outset, Chandra swung into action with the born effrontery of a seasoned gambler. “As the team leader, I take ownership but the redressal has to be a united and strong effort,” he says.

Salmon Lollipop

Is he big on drawing in local produce? “I have been pushing for fresh, local produce since I started out. Quite challenging, with Insta food narratives dominating the foodscape. It isn’t a trend. It is logical. Millets, with their age-old goodness, needed to come back on the plate, to give back to the farmer,” he points out. “My only parameter is goodness. So while I source ingredients locally as much as I can, for instance in Mumbai, I get my fish from Kochi as the varieties in Mumbai simply do not measure up in taste.”

Despite being a highly sought -after chef for 14 years, Chandra is averse to posturing on social media. “I simply loathe the vanity investment,” he says. So while he isn’t really the Twitter king, the economy of tweets appeals to him as he airs his opinions. “I am a chef, fine, but I can have an opinion on political issues as well. I needn’t upload pictures of my personal life and my creations.”

Chandra does his own gardening, washing and cooking. So what’s next? “I don’t have a manifesto. No book, no roles as a judge on the telly (blame his acrid honesty)... I never want to compartmentalise myself professionally. I’d rather do my own thing, like write a novel. I am fascinated by India. I want to give back.” Chandra has a simple anthem for survival: “Learn to depend on your own self. Don’t depend on others. Be hands-on, and work on your shortcomings.”","Winter is here and Manu Chandra has begun serving up extra warmth in a bowl for the soul through the One Bowl Winter meals at Monkey Bar across Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata.

Marvels of moringa oil,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/nov/25/marvels-of-moringa-oil-1709379.html,"Saturday, November 25, 2017 06:18 PM +0530","There are some distinct ingredients that add a unique taste to our cooking, and our favourite dishes become less interesting without them. Drumsticks or moringa (long slender, triangular seed-pods) have great importance in many south Indian delicacies such as sambar, rasam, avial etc. Unlike today, moringa was a lesser known vegetable to north Indian people but in the south we had a tree in every kitchen garden as it was ideal soil to grow a moringa plant. Once the plant grows to a usual height of 6/7 metres, you have regular yield for domestic use and sometimes more to give away.

Kids were taught how to eat these hard-looking, long pieces of drumsticks in our curries: “Gently split them open and separate the creamy flesh with your teeth and enjoy the pleasant flavour”. Along with popularity of south Indian food away from home, like other ingredients, drumsticks too travelled far and wide, yet people wouldn’t like this vegetable until they learn to eat the soft flesh inside and discard the fibrous exterior. Occasionally, people even misunderstand it for okra and chew drumstick for long time and make funny remarks like “dish was very tasty but that okra was under-cooked!”

Later, as healthy eating became a focal point for many, especially in the last decade or so, people discovered other uses of moringa tree. Its leaves are used in daily diet due to its highly nutritious qualities; people are getting used to its slightly sharper taste. Until recently we didn’t know about delicious warm salads made of moringa flowers and they taste amazing too; you can feel lightness as you complete a meal with them. All these dishes were already part of a village meal, especially agro families.

That was only half the story of illustrious moringa family and its use in our food and medicines. Meeting Nanalal Satra in Bengaluru was a pleasant surprise as he started talking about his successful export of moringa oil to Germany. Unfortunately, many of us wouldn’t have even heard of this oil, which has a variety of usage and a tremendous demand in Europe. Purabi Sarkar has done research on moringa oil and travels around spreading benefits of this special oil and we were lucky enough to listen to one of her lectures.

Purabi talked about moringa oil’s rich vitamin and unsaturated fatty acid qualities. It is also used to increase health and strength of hair and scalp. Moringa oil is extracted by pressing the seeds of Moringa oleifera. Countries such as India and Sri Lanka, and Africa produce the best variety, also called Ben oil, which has high amounts of behenic acid. There are so many good qualities and reasons to show the superior demand for moringa oil. No wonder, it was mentioned as a very useful oil in Ayurveda, and the medicinal books of Greece and Rome.

The oil contains antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, which help in curing cuts, bruises, burns, insect bites and rashes. It’s also supposed to be a nice cooking oil owing to its soft, appealing taste, though it’s more expensive than the many others available and subject to availability. Ayurveda doctor Sanand suggests, “Moringa oil is good for people with sleeping disorders, prevents ageing and contains aphrodisiac elements.”

Time and again, it is revealed that simple, wholesome foods like moringa provide incredible balance to our health and happiness. As Purabi insists, “We need to educate people and develop these nature’s remedies for everyday living, with increased demand. It will enhance interest for large-scale production of moringa oil. We have the best quality moringa in our region and ideal weather conditions to cultivate it.” The author runs the London-based Rasa chain of restaurants","Meeting Nanalal Satra in Bengaluru was a pleasant surprise as he started talking about his successful export of moringa oil to Germany.

Dishfuls of delicacies from culinary cultures,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/nov/18/dishfuls-of-delicacies-from-culinary-cultures-1703118.html,"Saturday, November 18, 2017 04:01 PM +0530","Every family has some special recipes that they cherish. These are the dishes full of stories that bring back the feeling of warmth, comfort and simplicity every time they are made. While for many of us they just remain the delicacies cooked by mothers or grandmothers and are lost with the changing times, some make a point to carry forward the family legacy. Here we speak to some chefs, who have either recreated the heritage recipes or dishes of their childhood.

Some are presenting these in their menus in a new avatar making a personalised statement while others are re-producing them as authentic as they can be for food lovers’ delight. Culinary journey of Balaji Natarajan, Executive Sous Chef, Park Hyatt, Chennai, is loaded with childhood memories of his grandma’s food. So, he has dedicated some dishes to his family and traditions.

Balaji takes pride in introducing his native region and its traditional cuisine. “I am a ‘Kongu Tamilian’ belonging to a region called Kongunadu in Tamil Nadu. This cuisine is a collection of recipes from more than 50 cities in Tamil Nadu, unlike Chettinad cuisine—food of only one city of Tamil Nadu called Karaikudi,” he says. “Kongunadu cuisine does not involve marination of any raw material. Addition of roasted groundnut paste to curries and Khormas creates a very different flavour.”

As a child, Balaji spent all his time in the joint family set-up in Sathyamangalam. From that memory, he shares one of his family’s recipe of Kambu Paniyaram. “Kambu means pearl millet, Paniyaram means a dumpling,” he says. “Kambu Paniyaram can be enjoyed any time of the day.”

He says his grandma used traditional stone grinder called ‘Attangal’ to grind the millet batter. ‘Aruvamanai’ is traditional equipment used in villages for grating coconuts and for cutting vegetables. Kuzhipaniyaram Karai is a traditional cast iron pan with mould used to make Paniyaram dumplings.

Balaji says, “Kongunadu cuisine is neither very spicy nor oily and healthy to eat.”

A dish that makes Chef Ajay Anand, Director of Culinary, Pullman and Novotel New Delhi Aerocity, emotional is Lahore ki Pinni from the house of Madan Lal Halwai in Sadar Bazar of Old Delhi. “I remember my early childhood years when my grandfather would take me to this shop. The shop was set up on the auspicious occasion of Lohri in 1948, after the family migrated to Delhi from Lahore. Lahore ki Pinni has been on their menu since the first Republic Day in 1950 and no Delhi winter of mine was complete without biting into the delightful Madan Pinni. The sense of joy I get after biting into something so simple yet so memorable is awesome.”

Going back to their roots, celebrated chefs are digging into history and making utmost efforts to preserve our rich culinary traditions. Chef Arun Sundararaj, Executive Chef, The Taj Mahal Hotel, New Delhi, says, “At Varq, we constantly endeavour to offer unique and meaningful experiences by frequently curating special menus inspired by flavours from different corners of the country.

For example, we crafted a special menu ‘Lost Recipes of the Royals’ which brought forth forgotten recipes from the royal kitchens of four erstwhile kingdoms of India—Kashmiri Dogras, the kings of Travancore, the Nizams of Hyderabad and the Mewars of Rajasthan. The menu featured regal dishes like Pattode ke kebab, Tujji chicken, Paneer gulnar kebab, Nizami saada aash, Cheera ada curry, Noori Hyderabadi biryani and desserts like garlic kheer with broken wheat porridge. We familiarised ourselves with the various cooking techniques used in these kitchens. For Saada Aash, the Nizami lamb soup is simmered for seven hours and tempered seven times before it is served. Khichdi Rafat is the Nizami royals’ twist to the humble khichdi cooked with tender pieces of chicken, duck, lamb, almonds and aromatic spices.”

Talking about his favourite recipe, Arun says, “Duet of Paasley Angeera and Murgh Hawa Mahal is my favourite. Inspired by the kings of Mewar, the dish is our take on the signature Rajasthani lamb chop and cooked the traditional way on charcoal.”

Desi Citiwala Kukkad is one dish that steals the show in the genre of heritage recipes at Hotel Fairmont, Jaipur. Executive Chef Manpreet Singh Mallik says, “The dish is inspired by and dedicated to all the home cooks, mothers, dhabas and the real rustic cuisine of India. While conversing with the guests we realised that they often want to taste the traditional foods.”

He adds: “So we selected chicken-based dish. We have tied up with a local farmer from a nearby village to source our desi murga. The masalas are hand-ground in a mortar and pestle (imam dasta), and then carefully cooked in pressure cooker. This dish is cooked on the bone, which ensures all the flavour remains in the curry. We serve it in a tiny pressure cooker, while it is still hot.”

The future of wine: Artificial Intelligence to revolutionise wine-buying,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/nov/15/the-future-of-wine-artificial-intelligence-to-revolutionise-wine-buying-1701736.html,"Wednesday, November 15, 2017 03:46 PM +0530","PANAJI: Wondering whether a Chardonnay pairs well with fish, or a nice juicy steak would work nicely with a Cabernet Sauvignon? In a few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would address these dilemmas for you, playing its part as a virtual sommelier, according to Robert Joseph, a wine expert, wine producer and author of an upcoming book on the future of wines.

UK-based Joseph, who has authored 25 books, including ""The Complete Encyclopedia of Wine"", has keenly watched developments in India's nascent wine industry and says that Kashmir, with its climate and abundance of water, could be ideal for developing vineyards.

Over the next few decades, the wine ecosystem would undergo a sea change, right from the manner in which consumers buy wine to involvement of machines in the production process and AI coming to the aid of wine buyers and enthusiasts when it comes to choosing the right vino.

""AI will revolutionise wine-buying. I am going to tell my digital assistant, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri that I want to buy a bottle of red wine and it will say to me, 'Do you want to have the one you had last time?' It knows you so well, what you like and what your friends like. And what AI doesn't know today, it will learn, very fast,"" Joseph told IANS on the sidelines of 'Sula Selections: Globe in a Glass Roadshow 2017' event here.

And of course, technology will determine the growth of the industry, right from the vineyards to sales.

""Self-drive cars mean we will not have to worry about drinking and driving, spurring consumption. Labour is a big problem in the US and Europe. It will be possible to automate a vineyard completely within 5 to10 years. Robots will do the whole thing. Already we are getting drones to do the flying over the vineyards, which can tell you which vines need water or treating,"" said Joseph, who is a partner at le Grand Noir wines in France.

""Machines will do a lot of the judging (wine tasting). They can judge between an OK wine and a not-so-Ok wine pretty effectively,"" he said, adding that there would still be scope for human discernment.

But wine critics, he said, would be more and more redundant with peer reviews replacing the formal art of wine criticism.

""We are going to see different kinds of wines, like fruit-flavoured wines; you will see a lot more wine cocktails. You are going to see packaging changes. Bottles don't need to be 75 centiliters big. That is the size, because it was the lung capacity of the French glass-blower 300 years ago. There's no God who defined the size. We are going to see wines in single serves and big bottles,"" he said.

Joseph also marked out climate change as one of the key challenges for the wine industry, with alterations in weather patterns even possibly threatening the holy turf of wine-making -- France and Italy.

""It's going to be very, very interesting and potentially going to be challenging. In established regions like Bordeaux, Burgundy and Loire, it is questionable whether they are going to be growing the same grapes. That's a really big question and there is some experimentation going on, but not enough,"" he said.

Wines from the popular French regions, he said, are already tasting different. ""Grapes are much riper than they used to be. But it's just not about warming. That means there are going to be places which are going to be warmer, which are not warmer. English wines are starting to benefit already, maybe, Iceland, who knows? That's a dramatic change. We will see more vineyards going into the hills in lots of places, which includes India,"" he said.

Kashmir, he said, could be the place where Indian wine industry may eventually head to. ""If you want to be really futuristic and optimistic, one day Kashmir will be an interesting place to grow grapes,"" he said.","In a few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would address these dilemmas for you, playing its part as a virtual sommelier, according to Robert Joseph, a wine expert, wine producer and author of an upcoming book on the future of wines.

Watch out for the consequences before you continue disrupting your food habit,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/nov/13/watch-out-for-the-consequences-before-you-continue-disrupting-your-food-habit-1700016.html,"Monday, November 13, 2017 04:52 PM +0530","LONDON: Are you disturbing your everyday eating behaviour just to lose extra kilos or gain weight to your skinny body? Watch out for the consequences before you continue disrupting your habit.

A new research has found that women are majorly affected by the eating disorder, also defined as a mental disorder that causes abnormal eating habits and negatively affects a person's physical or mental health.

Disruptions in the eating behaviour may not necessarily be motivated by the drive for pursuit of thinness or any distortion of body image, but rather gender expectations and pressures from a culturally dominated society.

In addition, the media plays a significant role in further influencing the minds of the spectators by floating unattainable images of the body unnecessarily, as mentioned in the research, which was published in the journal Eating Disorders.

""It is important to stress that the study does not work on the assumption that issues concerning gender identity are only relevant to the experience and treatment of eating disorders in girls and women,"" said Su Holmes, researcher at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, the UK.

""The focus on how eating -- and body distress -- may be used to negotiate dominant ideas about gender and sexuality is similarly applicable to male patients, as well as gender minorities, even whilst the cultural constructions at stake may be different.""

The researchers examined female participants, aged between 19 and 51 years, over 10 weeks. All the participants were diagnosed with anorexia, a type of eating disorder in which people avoid eating to maintain a low body weight.

The results derived that people who are diagnosed with eating behaviours act as passive victims of various influences like media and society, in most cases.","LONDON: Are you disturbing your everyday eating behaviour just to lose extra kilos or gain weight to your skinny body?

Which one of these types of wine drinkers are you?- The New Indian Express,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/nov/12/which-one-of-these-types-of-wine-drinkers-are-you-1699425.html,"Sunday, November 12, 2017 09:26 PM +0530","LONDON: In a recent study conducted by the Michigan State University, the golden rules of wine pairing should be thrown out of the window.

The reason being, according to the researchers people fit into one of four different wine-drinking preference categories, better known as vinotypes, according to The Independent.

According to the study, the four categories are –



1) Sweet - Very picky about their wines. These people want their wines to be sweet, light, and not too strong. More than 70 per cent of these drinkers are women. They also typically love soda, and excess salt.

2) Hypersensitive – They are somewhat similar to the people in the sweet, picky category. But they are slightly more open minded about exploring new wines - provided they’re simple and clean. Experts believe that these people are most likely to complain about TV volume and thermostat temperature.

3) Sensitive – In the middle of the wine-drinking spectrum, are people who are sensitive. They are flexible and adventurous. The researchers say these people will also tend to display signs of being free-spirited and less rigid in everyday life.

4) Tolerant - People in this category demand intensity from their wines, big bold flavours, and just don’t get how others like drinking 'wimpy' wines. They tend to be decisive and more linear thinkers. Their wine preferences point to rich, very intensely flavoured whites and full-bodied reds.

The researchers came to this conclusion after surveying a group of adults on food and beverage preferences, and their consumption patterns.

The researchers say they were able to predict wine preferences based on the data gathered about their eating, drinking and other personal habits.

According to Carl Borchgrevink, lead author of the study, customers should drink their favourite wines instead of those suggested by a sommelier.

He added that it was the palate that rules and not someone else’s idea of which wine we should drink with our food.

Pastry queen’s eureka moment,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/nov/11/pastry-queens-eureka-moment-1697057.html,"Saturday, November 11, 2017 05:12 PM +0530","Eureka Araujo used to love making a mess while baking with her mom in the kitchen. The Goa girl says her love for pastry stemmed from the home kitchen under the tutelage of her homebaker mother. “My transition from an amateur to a professional naturally sprung out of the cooking traditions in our family,” says the 26-year-old who recently clinched the ‘Pastry Queen India Prize 2017’ hosted by the Gurgaon-based Academy of Pastry Arts in September.

Eureka Araujo with her desserts

Eureka, who hails from the serene town of Ribander, has had a dynamic career. She studied at the Institute of Hotel Management, Goa; worked as a junior sous chef at the Umaid Bhawan Palace, Jodhpur. But in hindsight, joining the Academy of Pastry Arts in 2016 was a blessing in disguise. “My mentor Chef Zavher Chowdhury, who trained us at Taj, called us for masterclasses that were being conducted at the Academy by masterchefs from around the globe. Though it was expensive, it was the best decision I ever made,” she says.

Having mentored the Junior Pastry Team that competed at SIGEP’s Junior Pastry Championship in Italy in January, she had a strong inkling to bag the female pastry cup. Eureka recalls the last two months before entering the competition as super intensive, much like taking up the gauntlet. “It involved tastings, creating flavour combinations, late nights and trials after trials for the India-level competition,” she explains.

In the two-day event, the five contestants had to prepare four desserts as a rigorous test of dexterity in the art of making French deserts. “My Fallen Trone chocolate cake with the pressurised smoke of dry ice left everyone awestruck,” says Araujo, adding that “artistic show piece, proficiency, technique and ingenuity are all tested in creating masterpieces worth accolades.”

Wrestling with time in the presence of the best pastry chefs was the key challenge. “Right proportions of ingredients, serving the desserts on time with the correct weight, temperature, installation of desserts and following competition guidelines made me more efficient and meticulous in approach,” she adds.

Her fond childhood memories date back to the gleeful Goan Christmas eve with carols playing in the background and donuts, Bebinca, Marzipan, Jujubes being prepared in the company of friends and family. “This was the time when I learnt to prepare my most prized family dessert, Bath, a popular semolina cake eaten as a tradition in Goa during Christmas,” says Eureka, whose favourite food haunts are standalone bakeries like Theos and Bombakery in Gurgaon.

She believes mint is the most underutilised ingredient. “Mint is not just a garnish but can be used in ganache, compotes.” Her trusted sweet flavour combinations are orange. After having baked a non-allergic gluten-free chocolate cake, her latest fetish is to be adept at sugar art.

Following the pastry queen title, Eureka’s elation knows no bounds as she prepares to showcase her culinary competence at the Ladies World Pastry Championship to be held in Italy in January 2018.

“I will travel to Malaysia for a month-long training by the masterchefs from the Academy. But my return will entail a lot of research, planning, endless trials, late nights and no sleep,” she says. Eureka looks forward to sharing the stage with acclaimed chefs, including Amaury Guichon, Cedric Grolet and Emmanuele Forcone.","The Goa girl says her love for pastry stemmed from the home kitchen under the tutelage of her homebaker mother.

The one where service always exceeds expectations and anticipates everything one can need even before you suspect it. A place where the furniture is just right, the lighting to your taste, and the guests never complain. The prices are comparable, if not outright cheaper, than the finest of outlets you would have otherwise considered and the best part, you never need to drive back with a few drinks in

your system.

I am talking about eating in the comfort of your own home, of ordering food in and relaxing with it while you binge watch whatever online media consolidated format throws up as currently trending. In the last few years, ordering in has come a long way, from the local dhaba where one sent the atta and got back cooked tandoori rotis to curating a Southeast or Far East Asian menu with all the necessary condiments, home delivery has made me less social than the worst of WhatsApp groups!

Today ordering in is such a lucrative category that a lot of restaurants regard their brick-and-mortar outlet as merely a shop window to the real cash cow. They put up with exorbitant rents in ludicrously posh markets just to get people to try their ware and then get the hitched on to the, pun intended, delivery wagon.

Just look at Noshi, they charge a hefty 10 per cent as packing charge and I never once shudder while paying it because the way their food turns up at home is better than what many a restaurant can manage in their salons! Similarly, Thai Crate does a top-notch job. Good-To-Go is another app, I heavily rely on for my raw ingredients (meats mainly) and their carbon-ice fresh delivery standards have got me fish so fresh I could style sushi out of it. With all these fellas, the USP is quick efficient deliveries at a premium but one that’s worth it.

Even the local desi kitchens have upped their ante: from heat-preserving packaging to heat-and-serve

(and reusable) containers, it’s very commendable. Domino’s was possibly the first success in the delivery space but since then have lost their edge: their pizzas were barely average but their 30-minutes-or-less standard still made them a reliable proposition.

Now, with that time promise out of the window, they have surely lost ground. But I do commend them on having being extremely eco-friendly with their packaging since the beginning. In fact, the only thing that I would like to see going ahead is for this industry to have a growing reliance on recyclable and sustainable materials over non-biodegradable plastics. A bit has been progress but a lot remains to be achieved on this front.

But home delivery is certainly the future. I know because even I succumbed and downloaded the Zomato app for ordering food home: I grudgingly admit that it makes life much simpler. I am still resisting Swiggy and yet I still console myself that I shall never be the guy who walks into a restaurant and asks for the table reservation app-related discount that was promised while booking!

Did you know mushrooms may have anti aging potential?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2017/nov/10/did-you-know-mushrooms-may-have-anti-aging-potential-1697410.html,"Friday, November 10, 2017 11:43 AM +0530","WASHINGTON: Your favourite pizza topping could you help fight aging!

A team of Penn State researchers found mushrooms are rich in antioxidants that scientists say could be used fight aging and boost general health.

The study suggests that mushrooms have high amounts of the ergothioneine and glutathione, both important antioxidants, said Professor Robert Beelman.

He added that the researchers also found that the amounts the two compounds varied greatly between mushroom species.

""What we found is that, without a doubt, mushrooms are highest dietary source of these two antioxidants taken together, and that some types are really packed with both of them,"" said Beelman.

Beelman said that when the body uses food to produce energy, it also causes oxidative stress because some free radicals are produced. Free radicals are oxygen atoms with unpaired electrons that cause damage to cells, proteins and even DNA as these highly reactive atoms travel through the body seeking to pair up with other electrons.

Replenishing antioxidants in the body, then, may help protect against this oxidative stress.

""There's a theory -- the free radical theory of aging -- that's been around for a long time that says when we oxidize our food to produce energy there's a number of free radicals that are produced that are side products of that action and many of these are quite toxic,"" said Beelman. ""The body has mechanisms to control most of them, including ergothioneine and glutathione, but eventually enough accrue to cause damage, which has been associated with many of the diseases of aging, like cancer, coronary heart disease and Alzheimer's.""

According to the researchers, the amounts of ergothioneine and glutathione in mushrooms vary by species with the porcini species, a wild variety, containing the highest amount of the two compounds among the 13 species tested.

""We found that the porcini has the highest, by far, of any we tested,"" said Beelman. ""This species is really popular in Italy where searching for it has become a national pastime.""

The more common mushroom types, like the white button, had less of the antioxidants, but had higher amounts than most other foods, Beelman said.

The amount of ergothioneine and glutathione also appear to be correlated in mushrooms, the researchers said. Mushrooms that are high in glutathione are also high in ergothioneine, for example.

Cooking mushrooms does not seem to significantly affect the compounds, Beelman said.

""Ergothioneine are very heat stable,"" said Beelman.

Beelman said that future research may look at any role that ergothioneine and glutathione have in decreasing the likelihood of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

""It's preliminary, but you can see that countries that have more ergothioneine in their diets, countries like France and Italy, also have lower incidences of neurodegenerative diseases, while people in countries like the United States, which has low amounts of ergothioneine in the diet, have a higher probability of diseases like Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's,"" said Beelman.

""Now, whether that's just a correlation or causative, we don't know. But, it's something to look into, especially because the difference between the countries with low rates of neurodegenerative diseases is about three milligrams per day, which is about five button mushrooms each day.""

The findings have been published in the journal Food Chemistry.","A team of Penn State researchers found mushrooms are rich in antioxidants that scientists say could be used fight aging and boost general health.

The study found evidence that people may have been eating the popular fruit as many as 15,000 years before they domesticated the fruit as an agricultural crop.

""Like most plants, grapes are typically considered to have been cultivated around 7,000 to 10,000 years ago, but our work suggests that human involvement with grapes may precede these dates,"" said Brandon Gaut, evolutionary biologist and Professor at the University of California - Irvine.

""The data indicate that humans gathered grapes in the wild for centuries before cultivating them. If we are right, it adds to a small but growing set of examples that humans had big effects on ecosystems prior to the onset of organised agriculture,"" he said.

For the study, appearing in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, the team compared the sequenced genomes of wild and domesticated Eurasian grapes.

The scientists found that populations of the fruit steadily decreased until the period of domestication, when grapes began to be grown and harvested for wine.

The long decline could reflect unknown natural processes, or it may mean that humans began managing natural populations long before they were actually domesticated, the researchers said.

The altering of several important genes -- involved in sex determination and others related primarily to the production of sugar -- during domestication was a key turning point for the fruit.

These changes helped define grapes and probably contributed to the spreading of the crop throughout the ancient world, Gaut noted.

In addition, the modern grape genomes contained more potentially harmful mutations than did the fruit's wild ancestors.

These accumulate due to clonal propagation, which is reproduction by multiplication of genetically identical copies of individual plants, the researchers said.","NEW YORK: Humans started consuming grapes nearly 22,000 years ago when the ice sheets covering much of North America and Europe began retreating, finds a genomic study.

WASHINGTON: Maize, long a staple crop, could soon become more nutritious.

A new research from the Cornell University has identified genes that control vitamin E content in maize grain, a finding that could lead to improving the nutritional profile of this crop.

Researchers combined different types of genetic association analyses to identify 14 genes across the genome that were involved in the synthesis of vitamin E. Six genes were newly discovered to encode proteins that contribute to a class of antioxidant compounds called tocochromanols, collectively known as vitamin E. Along with antioxidant properties, tocochromanols have been associated with good heart health in humans and proper functioning in plants.

Co-corresponding author Michael Gore revealed that they have established a near-complete foundation for the genetic improvement of vitamin E in grain of maize and other major cereals.

Jay Asher's 'Thirteen Reasons Why' and Sherman Alexie's 'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' top the list of 'challenged' books from 2017 | AP

NEW YORK: Before allegations of sexual harassment, Jay Asher and Sherman Alexie were facing criticisms of a different kind.

Asher's ""Thirteen Reasons Why"" and Alexie's ""The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian"" top the American Library Association's list of ""challenged"" books from 2017, those most objected to by parents and other community members. The list also includes Harper Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and one of last year's top-selling young adult novels, Angie Thomas' ""The Hate U Give.""

Complaints about books range from the theme of suicide in ""Thirteen Reasons Why"" to profanity and sexual content in Alexie's book. James LaRue, who runs the library association's Office for Intellectual Freedom, said that future challenges could well be based on the authors themselves. Last year, Bill Cosby's ""Little Bill Books"" were on the ALA list because of multiple accusations of sexual assault against the actor-comedian.

""I personally believe the book is distinct from the author,"" LaRue said. ""But when a librarian faces that kind of challenge, my advice is to treat it like any other kind of challenge. You look at the nature of the challenge, consider the context and make the decision based on the needs of the local community.""

Over the past few months, several writers have had book deals and other projects canceled or have been kicked out of organizations. Asher was dropped by his literary agent and expelled from the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators. Alexie ended up turning down one of the library association's highest honors, the Carnegie Medal, which had been awarded for his memoir ""You Don't Have to Say You Love Me."" The prize was announced in early February, just before allegations surfaced that he had harassed numerous women.

The ALA list is part of the association's State of America's Libraries report and marks the beginning of National Library Week, which runs through April 14. Books drawing attention, whether because of sales or a film adaptation, often become more likely to receive challenges. In 2017, ""Thirteen Reasons Why"" was adapted into a popular Netflix series, while ""The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian"" has been widely read and taught since coming out a decade ago. In previous years, Maya Angelou's ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" and J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series have been among notable challenged works.

Asher and Alexie have been on the list before; ""The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian"" topped the list for 2014, while Alexie's book and ""Thirteen Reasons Why"" finished second and third, respectively, for 2012.

Books on the new list were a mix of older works such as Lee's novel (violence, racial language) and Khaled Hosseini's ""The Kite Runner"" (""May lead to terrorism"") and more recent books, including Cory Silverberg's ""Sex is a Funny Word"" and ""I Am Jazz,"" by Jessica Herthel and Jazz Jennings (""Gender identity""). Three works were cited for ""LGBT content"": the gay-themed penguin story ""And Tango Makes Three,"" by Peter Parnell and Justin Richardson; Alex Gino's ""George""; and Raina Telgemeier's ""Drama.""

The association tallied 356 challenges, up from 323 last year, but in line with numbers over the past decade. The ALA, which believes that reported cases are just a fraction of actual challenges, bases its list on news reports and on accounts submitted from libraries. A challenge is defined as a ""formal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that materials be removed because of content or appropriateness.""

LaRue did not have a number for books actually pulled from shelves, although he cited some examples. After seven students from a Colorado community killed themselves, a school district official in 2017 ordered librarians to temporarily stop circulating ""Thirteen Reasons Why."" An Arizona school district pulled ""The Kite Runner,"" and offered no explanation. A superintendent in Katy, Texas, pulled ""The Hate U Give"" after a man attending a school board meeting complained of the book's language and depiction of drug use.","File photo of the book 'Thirteen Reasons Why'.

Cleo Wade's book 'Heart Talk' encourages a healthy soul diet,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/2018/apr/10/cleo-wades-book-heart-talk-encourages-a-healthy-soul-diet-1799507.html,"Tuesday, April 10, 2018 10:31 AM +0530","NEW YORK: Cleo Wade is known for not only her poetry, but her positive, uplifting Instagram mantras that have earned a following that includes Yara Shahidi and Jessica Alba.

So it's not surprising that on a day when she's running around like crazy promoting her new book, she doesn't complain about being tired, but has another affirmation that fuels her eternally optimistic outlook.

""I (recently) went on a complaint cleanse,"" said the poet and activist, whose reasoning was simple. ""'Your dream book is coming out into the world, it's exactly the book you wanted to make. You can find a way to not complain about the logistics, work and people and things that come with it.'""

""Heart Talk: Poetic Wisdom for a Better Life"" isn't a self-help book, but it contains plenty of verses from Wade that are aimed to feed the soul — she calls it a ""healthy soul diet."" Her inspirational slant has led her to be being called the Oprah for millennials. The book covers everything from self-worth to relationships.

""What is the opposite of self-care? Self-abandonment. We're also in this state of not being able to practice self-care in our dynamics with our neighbor, our partner, our boss, our colleague, the world,"" she said. ""There's so much nourishment that is needed for that space, in order for us to feel really cared for so we can recognize how to care for other people.""

AP: You spend hours with fans at book signings. Why is it so important for you to give people your full attention?

Wade: There is a desire for people to be seen and heard. We can't possibly learn how to love our neighbor unless we find common ground with them. But also we can't understand how to listen to others if we don't listen to ourselves. Whenever young people email me about heartbreak I tell them, this is the most divine point in which to listen to yourself because there's such an education as far as your learning, your needs and desires.

AP: You must find wherever you go people want deep conversation and encouragement.

Wade: I'm definitely the person that if I am in a space, I'm looking for the macro-connection and if I feel like I can't take that on, I just stay home. For me, I definitely have that boundary of if I don't feel like I could really be in that space, hear about your life, show up for you, and offer the best of me to you, then I know that's a day that I need to stay home.

AP: Where does your outlook on the world come from?

Wade: (Laughs) I definitely think a lot of it comes from growing up in a place like New Orleans because it's a deeply expressive culture. Also my dad is an artist, my mom is a chef. Having these people with such clear manifestations of what they like to do with their time, it definitely fueled me to understand that there is a very individualized thing you can do in the world.

AP: Social media has really helped you spread your message but do you find it can be toxic sometimes?

Wade: It can either be used as a tool or a weapon. I always encourage people to really monitor their media diets. I don't think food is the only thing we digest. We also ingest information and if you're finding your media feels really divisive or if it's making you judge or covet in a way that doesn't make you feel good, then it's time to maybe switch up your media.","""'Your dream book is coming out into the world, it's exactly the book you wanted to make.

Poetry gave her freedom,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/2018/apr/09/poetry-gave-her-freedom-1799224.html,"Tuesday, April 10, 2018 07:37 AM +0530","KOCHI:At 40, in the silent corners of her apartment in Saudi Arabia, leading a lonely homemaker’s life, she rediscovered the poet hidden in her. Kochi native Fathima Salim’s maiden book Manaveeyam has hit the right chord with readers who have appreciated her language and versatility of themes.

“I used to write since I was 13 and wrote actively in college magazines, but with the passage of time and family responsibilities coming up, I left behind my passion,” says Fathima. She says it was her close friend and old collegemate Vani who encouraged her to write again after a gap of 22 years.

Fathima also remembers how three years ago on her visit to Haj, she underwent a trauma due to the Mecca crane collapse. “After that I completely lost my voice and was unable to use my fingers. Slowly, I overcome it and at that juncture, my friend kept cheering me on to start writing and come out of the shock,” she says.

Also, with her husband busy at his job and her kids going to school, she spent hours alone in the house. As the country had a lot of restrictions, she found solace in the pen again. Thus Manaveeyam was born.

The collection has 52 poems on different themes, from romance, childhood, revolution and women’s empowerment.

Fathima who has now shifted back to Kochi said that her stint in Saudi Arabia has influenced her work. “In Saudi, we hardly get to see a rainfall and there is a special aura when the drops touch the hot soil, all this reflects in my poem. Most of the poems come from my experience with a touch of fantasy and fiction,” she said.

She mentioned the non-repetitive element in poems has received an overwhelming response from readers. From a child enjoying the rain, the book moves to a romantic fascination of a teenager, miseries of a housewife and also touches on contemporary topics.“I have been constantly encouraged by my friends to write more and my next outing will be a story based on the lives of three different women,” says Fathima who holds tuition classes at home.","Kochi native Fathima Salim’s maiden book Manaveeyam has hit the right chord with readers who have appreciated her language and versatility of themes.

Judgment day,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/2018/apr/07/judgment-day-1797551.html,"Saturday, April 7, 2018 01:32 PM +0530","The only cure for temptation,’ Oscar Wilde famously quipped, ‘is to yield to it.’ So is it with Khurram Rahman’s East of Hounslow. I plunged into this debut novel and fell for it, hook, line, and sinker. Though I think the book should have had a statutory prediction: On publication, the next book by the author will munch up many lines of newsprint. For Pakistan-born, and England-raised author Khurram Rahman’s book is eminently readable. Should you have a taste for the classic British understated humour, it will be hard for any crime thriller to better this.

East of Hounslow, West London, is where the book begins. A British-born Muslim, Javid Qasim—we are told to call him Jay. ‘No one, but no one, calls me Javid, not even my mum,’ you hear him protest. If you go down that path, no self-respecting girl will give out her phone number to someone called Javid. There’s our Jay, a loveable fool, a petty dope dealer living happily with his widowed mother.

He is in no tearing hurry to grow up, setting out each day to peddle drugs, cruise the streets all of six days a week. On the side, he does all the wicked things that are against the faith he was born to. The only exception of course is ‘Juma’ or Friday when he heads to the local mosque.

With great pride, he leaves his recently acquired Beemer (with customised rims) parked outside with great care. You’re invited to look at its beautiful body, slender and sleek and oozing sex appeal—small wonder then, he’s in love with his BMW.

On arrival, he finds the House of Worship vandalised, the crazed handiwork of a bunch of hooligans. Life takes an unpredictable turn when he finds himself being arm-twisted into becoming an undercover M15 plant in a group of Jihadists. And that is precisely when he falls into the abyss. The Preacher warns: ‘Qayamat is coming. Judgment day is almost upon us. The day of reckoning, the day when we must answer… it has been prophesised… Look around you and you will see the signs. Women are naked in spite of being fully dressed. Earthquakes have increased…’

Jay teaches us while on the move, giving the reader a ready-reckoner into the lives of the stereotyped. With élan he takes you by the hand, himself a fumbling expert, trying to find a way through the minefields of the initiated. Clipped dialogues, staccato sentences and the hilariously brilliant prose set the pace of this excellent unputdownable crime thriller.

Read on. The climax will leave you breathless.","The only cure for temptation,’ Oscar Wilde famously quipped, ‘is to yield to it.’ So is it with Khurram Rahman’s East of Hounslow.

The other,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/2018/apr/07/the-other-1797556.html,"Saturday, April 7, 2018 01:23 PM +0530","It’s the unprompted, random remarks that reveal the most about how we see the world. On a recent visit to Ahmedabad, my taxi wound through the unfamiliar city, passing neighbourhoods and markets, the windows framing clutches of people as they went about their business. As I tried to get a sense of it all, the driver gestured outside and remarked, “Yeh toh mini-Pakistan hai”.

That’s all it takes to mark a space, a people, a practice as ‘Other’. As ‘Not Us’. Whatever the imagined composition of ‘Us’ may be.In a work that is part memoir, part socio-political commentary, Neyaz Farooquee writes about becoming and being this Other, the shift from an understanding of oneself as a ‘Normal Human Being’ to one that is marked in ways not entirely comprehensible. An Ordinary Man’s Guide to Radicalism: Growing up Muslim in India takes us into the intimate spaces of the journey from innocence to understanding.

In September 2008, a residential building in Delhi’s Jamia Nagar was raided and two young men and a police officer died in the ensuing face-off. The incident came to be known as the ‘Batla House Encounter’ and sparked off a fierce debate around profiling and targeting on the basis of religion. Over the next few weeks, several students came under suspicion for being involved with the radical group, and were taken in for questioning, provoking protests by civil rights activists.

Farooquee, then a student at Jamia Millia Islamia University, lived a stone’s throw from the building where the encounter had taken place, and many of his friends lived in and around the location. Overnight, a sort of paranoia took hold, with the realisation that each one of them could be seen as possible suspects.

Lost mobile phones, random conversations with friends, loitering at now-dubious spots… anything could be seen as incriminating. Jamia Nagar was in any case seen as a Muslim ghetto, a place occupied by those with questionable sympathies. He writes: “Jamia Nagar creates a jumble of names, faces and identities, and possibly faulty memories. That memory could be yours, or someone else’s, and if that someone else is, let’s say, a Terror Suspect disguised as a Normal Human Being, you have no idea how his memory is going to behave. It was an alarming thought and it made everyone untrustworthy. Friends, close friends, acquaintances, strangers, everyone.”

But this is getting ahead of the story, which begins in a small village in Bihar’s Gopalgunj district, and a close-knit family with big dreams for the oldest grandchild. Farooquee describes in close and revealing detail his early years in the village, his relationship with his Dada, the train journey to the nation’s capital and the difficult process of making a home in a small and crowded corner of the big city.

Struggling with a new language, unfamiliar food, with the absence of a nurturing family, Farooquee’s experience will probably resonate with the millions of young people who leave their rural homes seeking education and what they hope is a better life. And in the process, they discover themselves and their ‘place’ in society.

The book is, essentially, a story about identity—the uncomplicated nurturing of it as a cultural fact, and the strategic positioning of it as a political reality. Farooquee writes without sentimentality, offering important insights into the incidental and systemic processes that create alienation and difference.

1857 through the eyes of a skull,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/2018/apr/07/1857-through-the-eyes-of-a-skull-1797554.html,"Saturday, April 7, 2018 01:19 PM +0530","The skull is an intriguing entry point, and it manages to underpin the entire narrative of Kim A Wagner’s new book The Skull of Alum Bheg: The Life and Death of Rebel of 1857. From this grisly starting point, Wagner narrates how, in the summer heat of mid-1857, native Bengal Army units at Sialkot mutinied, killing officers and civilians and looting the cantonment, and then set out for Delhi to join Bahadur Shah, the briefly-minted ‘Emperor of India’.

They didn’t make it. John Nicholson intercepted them with a British force as they tried to cross the Ravi river. Three days later, Nicholson annihilated the 1,100 trapped sepoys in the Battle of Trimmu Ghat. All but wiped out by ‘Nikal Seyn’ Nicholson’s moving column, the survivors fled into the Himalayas.

A year later they were dragged back to Sialkot and blown up from the mouth of a cannon; Havildar Alum Bheg among them. His head was picked up, ‘defleshed’, and brought home to Dublin by a captain of the 7th Dragoon Guards—the ultimate proof—as Wagner deems it, ‘of colonial power’.

In 1963, the skull was discovered in a store room of The Lord Clyde pub. The owners of the pub learnt from a note left in an eye socket that it belonged to Alum Bheg, who played a leading role in the mutiny in Sialkot. Wagner received an email in 2014 from the owners, and the story begins.But this book is not only about Alum Bheg. It is also about the experience of ordinary people from different parts of the world whose lives were drastically changed or cut short by the events of 1857 and soon after. It is more of a reconstruction of history rather than a biography of Alum Bheg.

And Wagner makes it believable; his depiction of life and death on the ground is helped by the depth of research and thickly footnoted academic rigor as it is by his evident passion for history and flair for language. It is a collective study of Indian sepoys and their common characteristics and their role in the events of 1857.

Wagner is careful to portray the personalities on all sides of the conflict and this makes his account all the more convincing. Although we know the final brutal outcome, we are drawn into the relationships and circumstances as if we were reading a fictional thriller. There are no heroes in this book, only victims.

The book brings together the story of thousands of Indian soldiers in British service whose names have been lost to history and whose existence was recorded only as a number when they deserted, were executed, or killed on the battlefield. The violence that produced Alum Bheg’s skull and its collection as a war trophy too finds continuing mention through the book. The brutality of British repression is not glossed over either. It never could be explained away in the decades after 1857; neither could the skull, and so it was hidden.

Wagner’s book is an exception to such history that has almost always been told from the British point of view. A lecturer in British imperial history at Queen Mary College in London, he however still seems to be on the fence with regards to the nomenclature: is it a mutiny, a rebellion or the first war of independence.

Nevertheless, as he notes in the introduction, his book is unlikely to appeal to many as neither does it indulge in Raj nostalgia nor does it subscribe to Indian nationalist mythology. In all, it is a valiant effort by Wagner and must be recognised as such.In itself, it makes for a compelling read and is likely to become a key resource for students of Indian colonial history.","The skull is an intriguing entry point, and it manages to underpin the entire narrative of Kim A Wagner’s new book The Skull of Alum Bheg: The Life and Death of Rebel of 1857.

Speaking after the launch of 'Hariye Jawa Lekha', (Collection of Lost Writings), the 82-year old Ananda Purashkar recipient said, ""This is a big problem and the writers are losing interest.

""Despite some past initiatives and efforts in this regard, those did not meet the desired result. Even there had been effort by Sheikh Hasina government, but that too yielded little effect,"" Mukhopadhyay told reporters on the sidelines of the book launch, here yesterday.

He said there should be an end to such practice, or else the writers will lose interest.

Mukhopadhyay said the craze over Bengali writers and their volume of works was much more evident in Bangladesh than in West Bengal.

Several books of the writer had been made into films.

Asked about the rallies announced by some intellectuals in protest against recent communal clashes in Bengal, Mukhopadhyay said, ""Only a handful of miscreants instigate riots.

Not the common peace loving people.

""Will those miscreants, involved in riots, listen to what we say? Won't they be looking for scope to vandalise and attack people in future as well?"" he wondered.

The writer said it should not be assumed that some stray incidents have disrupted the communal harmony of the entire country.

Why are we here? What happens when we die? Is there a God? And many more. Similar questions plagued author Anjali Kumar, who was also a lawyer at Google.

When she started asking questions her search engine couldn't answer, she embarked on a series of misadventures to find God -- or at least some form of enlightenment.

""Stalking God: My Unorthodox Search for Something to Believe In"" is the story of Kumar's quest to find a spiritual path in the modern world. The journey was filled with wonder, wild and sometimes frightening.

""In 2010, when my daughter Zia was born, I decided that I needed to find God. I told myself that she would eventually ask me questions that I couldn't answer and that completely unravelled me... I made a firm commitment to myself -- and to her -- that I would make a valiant effort to find us a comfortable spiritual home,"" Kumar writes in the Introduction.

Narrated from the open-minded perspective of a spiritual seeker rather than a religious scholar, the book offers an honest account of some of the less-than-mainstream spiritual practices that are followed by millions of people in the world today as she searched for answers to life's most universal questions.

Kumar, a part of a rapidly growing population in America that is highly spiritual but religiously uncommitted, was convinced that traditional religions were not a fit for her. She was also aware that she couldn't simply Google these answers.

She set out on a spiritual pilgrimage, looking for answers. During the quest, she headed to the mountains of Peru to learn from the shamans, attended the techie haunt of Burning Man, practised transcendental meditation, communed with angels and visited saints, goddesses, witches and faith healers. She even hired a medium to commune with the dead.

""As I watched the man burn, and the following day as I watched the Temple of Promise burn, I knew this to be true: We are temporary. And spectacular. In life and in death. There is an irony to the juxtaposition of our extreme importance and our complete irrelevance,"" she writes in the book.

Her light-hearted story offers a revealing look at the timeless and vexing issue of spirituality in an era when more and more people are walking away from formal religion.

Before starting her journey, when she raised the issue with her friends and family, she realised that she ""was late to the party"".

""Apparently, while I had been negotiating contracts at Google, the rest of the world had been on a quest to find enlightenment, spiritual clarity, and salvation,"" she writes.

During the quest, she realised that ""virtually everyone asked for essentially the same three things... Health. Happiness. Love"".

Her journey taught her so much more: ""What I found was completely unexpected. This book tells that story.""","When she started asking questions her search engine couldn't answer, she embarked on a series of misadventures to find God -- or at least some form of enlightenment.

Chasing yet another lead, he has reached a homeless shelter to identify her. Outside the building his sightless eyes follow the gaze of a mango tree that is almost always a grim association with his father’s suicide.

During their brief years of togetherness, Deepti remained a luminous presence in his life mellowing down the memory of his father’s suicide. With the light gone, Prakash turns blind in both the eyes and is once again obsessed by the thought of his father’s death.

“When he became certain that the reason behind Deepti’s disappearance would remain an unfathomable mystery, he found himself seriously pondering about the cause behind his own father’s vanishing act. He felt sure of a discernible connection in the inexplicable circumstances behind the sudden departure of the two people who had given meaning to his life.”

A chance encounter with a letter in his father’s library puts him in touch with Abha Ma, a colleague and friend of his father, and he begins a correspondence with her. Along with the unrelenting quest for his lost wife, he also becomes close to Rajani, a woman with a tormented past.

A passionate affair follows but Rajani can sense that she cannot have it all—the “luminescence” of Deepti being a lingering presence. Shyam, his childhood friend, is a witness to it all and accompanies Prakash everywhere—in search of Deepti and his visits to Rajani.

With these two characters, Meera’s narrative exhibits a complex but a clever interplay of light and darkness. While Prakash steps into the world of sightlessness, Shyam is the eyes through which he trudges the real world. Yet, Shyam is also the shadow just as Prakash functions through his mind’s eyes—when attempting to identify Deepti at the shelter or picking out books for patrons at the library he works.

Abha Ma’s last letter helps put the ghost of his father’s death behind him. What about Deepti’s mystery? What of the two women? The one he cannot find and the one he cannot have? The one who has disappeared and the one who left disillusioned. Elsewhere, the two (women) have had a brief interlude or so the author might like us to believe.

In this tale of a blind man’s relentless pursuit, one cannot ignore the presence of (blind) bats as metaphor for sights, sounds and emotions. Prakash describes his father’s body hanging from the branch of the tree “like a bat”. And soon after Deepti’s disappearance, his life hangs itself “upside down blindly like a bat”. Instances such as these also make it hard to believe that it is translation from Malayalam. The efforts of Ministhy S in keeping the voice intact do not go unnoticed. Needless to say, the book becomes at once heart-warming and heart-rending.","Flitting between darkness and light, and a plethora of emotions, The Unseeing Idol of Light by K R Meera is a haunting tale of Prakash who is grappling with the trauma of his wife, Deepti’s disappearance.

History is about rulers, wars and dry facts teased through deduction. The Silver Music Box by Mina Baites is a feminine retelling of a dreaded phase of Nazi Germany through the eyes of one Jewish family—the Blumenthals.

This domestic perspective is unique and emotional. The silver music box is a gift from silversmith Johann Blumenthal to his four-year-old son Paul on the eve of joining the German army in World War I. Over 1,00,000 Jews fought for their fatherland alongside other Germans, easily forgotten by the Nazis.

Johann never returns. In 1933, Paul settles into married life with the beautiful Clara while the slow horror of being segregated unfolds. Strangers cross the street on seeing them. Later they spit at them.

Ruffian neighbours punch Paul. Effectively ostracised, government orders specifically mention their store can no longer operate. Brownshirts visit their jewellery store and ransack it. It is not just the loss of livelihood or dignity as much as the slow awareness that their lives are in danger.

His uncle and his father-in-law refuse to leave their homeland. Paul’s mother migrates to Cape Town in a position to take nothing along. It would be sensible to follow suit. Paul chooses to travel abroad on fake passports. The going is not easy and with winter stretching ahead of them, Clara reveals that she is pregnant with their second child.

In London 1963, a young lady—Lillian—mourning the death of her parents discovers she is adopted and is given a silver music box. She investigates who she really is and where she came from.

While providing a counterpoint, trite domestic passages sit at odds with the wide sweep of the narrative. The actual language is simple enough to seem flippant bordering on dull. However, the author manages to create a well-structured tale set in a time we need to know about. The research is thorough and the style of writing brings characters and the backdrop alive. As a translation from German, it is remarkably lucid and meaningful.

In a bid to escape their fates, Paul and Clara convert to Christianity. It amounts to nothing as they are only known for their non-Aryan heritage and treated Jews are. Lillian is brought up as a Catholic. This unique situation of crossing the boundaries of religious identity is the stronger story and has been dealt with only in passing. To those interested in Nazi era Germany this is a must read.","The Silver Music Box by Mina Baites is a feminine retelling of a dreaded phase of Nazi Germany through the eyes of one Jewish family—the Blumenthals.

Travelling with the whirlwind,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/2018/mar/31/travelling-with-the-whirlwind-1794410.html,"Saturday, March 31, 2018 04:41 PM +0530","While reading a work of non-fiction, issues that matter are not just the author’s thought process, perspective and ability to look at facts dispassionately but also their body of work as one entity. The first introduction of Mehr Tarar to Indian readers is as a woman who was mocked and demonised in the media for her supposed involvement with a leading politician and the war of words that ensued between interested parties.

It was not very tasteful. Subsequently Tarar was scorned on both sides of the border. She was castigated loudly and dubiously by self-proclaimed upholders of tehzeeb and power in her country, Pakistan; to her credit she stood her ground. Her narrative subtly but succinctly reflects the nuances of the events that came to pass, but that is not all.

The writer reveals in-depth understanding of the lives of both eminent and everyday people, especially women. It examines the different aspects of Indo-Pak ties, and the problems and possible solutions without offering judgment.

The book holds detailed mentions of her homeland turning into the nurturing ground of newly-fundamentalist religion and how it affects lives across borders. She agonises over the trauma of misogyny in her country where female independence is ostracised and women are categorised according to chauvinistic views. But Tarar is Pakistani. She is in love with her country. She also has opinions on politics in our country. She is an assertive woman and she is political.

These do not bode well for a women in the male dominated society in Pakistan, which is always ready with unwelcome and unsought retribution. However, Tarar takes apart the wall of prejudice brick by brick with her lucid understanding of life, gender, and politics in her country. She is an unabashed patriot. But above all, she addresses humanity within her nation’s context, moving the reader with the complexity of belief.

Do We Not Bleed is a portmanteau of stories within a story, that houses a holistic national sentiment. It is through this perspective that I read the book; a sight I had gained, too, by a present on-the-ground understanding of Pakistan and expansive professional work on the arts and socio-cultural issues on a national and global scale where the chaos of the country is as visible as the beauty of its past.

Tarar’s book is a journey through the vast spectrum of layered history and the individual choices of the dramatis personae of her land’s tale. She addresses the contradiction of Jinnah’s love to create a country based on Islam— an ideal nation of peace and prosperity—and the hard facts of religion interfering with governance and the corruption in its politics and polity that has created many a catastrophe for the land of her birth.

Her language is delicately detailed yet the words hit home hard. Tarar throws caution to the wind and redeems herself in unwilling eyes with the grace and aplomb of a master scribe who knows what she is talking of and does it with a compassionate understanding of life and people.

The account of each individual’s life in the book is factual and lucidly descriptive. From the vast treasury of bilateral angst, rebellion with a world view, Tarar’s book is a verbal whirlwind through the mindscape of the people, predilections and prospects of the sub-continent.","She was castigated loudly and dubiously by self-proclaimed upholders of tehzeeb and power in her country, Pakistan; to her credit she stood her ground.

Dressed in a beige-coloured saree with motifs of cow on it, she flaunts her pallu, saying “this is my love for cows”.

The Bengaluru-based author was recently in the city for the launch of her book ‘The Cows of Bangalore’ by Prakriti Foundation. After having spent most of her childhood in namma Chennai, Shoba went on to graduate from the Columbia Journalism School, where she was awarded with a Pulitzer Fellowship.

Having spent 20 years in the US, Shoba is now settled in Bengaluru with her family. The award-winning author talks to us about her book, love for the city and culture.

“The beauty of cows is that you can expand it to look at anything in our country, so I was using that as an anchor to explore all that is happening and going on in India.” The book starts with an anecdote about the time when she saw a cow in the elevator of her apartment, brought in for a house-warming ceremony. Her Eureka moment for the book happened when she befriended Sarala, the lady who brought milk for her, and they shared a special relationship.

“We all encounter so many people in our daily lives like the isthiri wala and the flower vendor. But Sarala was unusual; she is very generous, a great story teller, she loves cows and moreover she was able to explain it in a way that somebody who is cynical can understand. Her personality is what gave rise to the book.” Shoba explains.

The book which is a simple narrative that happened organically over 10 years in Shoba’s life includes the story of how she went around villages in Karnataka with Sarala to buy her a new cow, with the money that she had given the latter on loan. “One day she came up to me and said ‘Amma, can you give me a loan of `40,000, I want to buy a cow.’ And being the good storyteller that she is, she convinced me to do the same. We looked at around 30 cows before settling on Anandalakshmi,” she says.

The book further looks into all the aspects of a cow and how it is an important part of the mythology and Indian culture. “Anything with ‘go’ is linked to the cow (Godavari, Gotra, Gopal). We introduced ghee and the cow was the source of it, we used the same ghee to do agni homam and reach out to god. Even in Vedic times, they would domesticate other animals like sheep, buffalo, horses, etc. So then why did they chose the cow of all those to be a sacred animal?” she asks.

The only challenge Shoba faced was when she had to decide whether to include the political aspects of the topic. “In India, the cow has become a political topic, so I had to make the choice if I should include it. As a vegetarian who loves animals I decided that if I have to do this halfway political thing I would have to get into the butchering and slaughtering, which I did not have the stomach for,” she says.","The Bengaluru-based author was recently in the city for the launch of her book ‘The Cows of Bangalore’ by Prakriti Foundation.

Truth of darkness unfolded layer by layer,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/2018/mar/24/truth-of-darkness-unfolded-layer-by-layer-1791076.html,"Saturday, March 24, 2018 07:10 PM +0530","This is an interesting bouquet of poetry from the former editor-in-chief of DNA. His experiences in the literary world and life in general seem to have seeped through the recesses of his poetry. There is a glimmer of darkness where the world scampers for light.

One agrees with Ranjit Hoskote’s inference in his forward which sees CP’s work as clearly not ‘entertain[ing] an unduly optimistic belief in the human animal’s belief to redeem itself from its failings’. In fact it is this quality that makes his work unique and brings out the decadence of the masses in a world, which in lapses of moments, is sliding to nothingness. What is left out is daily life. What is captivated is the wisdom of trials.

This quality runs through the entire stream of his poetry rightly justified by his writings in tribute to Vijay Nambisan at the beginning of the book. CP stands by the man’s integrity and a hope lost in the faith towards humanity uplifting itself by spirit in life when it is so base materially while dealing with men and women of creative and honest spirit. From this spring of the spewed raw truth rises the despair in CP’s verse.

The works may describe everyday life yet are decadent and reveal subtleties of the dark recesses of human turmoil beautifully. There is a sense of nothingness as far as time is concerned and life moves on even with the worst turmoil. The poems do not care to lend themselves to a poignant experience but are meant to show the facets, though sometimes ugly and sometimes devoid of life, in their entirety.

Some of the verses are uncomfortable to read and they are meant to be so. There is no release or catharsis but a brilliance of the ultimate truth of life. Life goes on in his works in a sauntering sort of a gait.

CP has also been careful not to show pity to the self in his works from memory and stayed away from a poignant attitude towards past events. Though the beautiful textures of darkness are brought out gently and not as a force unleashed, one can see he is capable of the sensitive positive subtleties, though he seems vary of it.

In some places within his verse he lapses into private moments that are incomprehensible and emerges again in shifts of expression of the lack of expectation of life and its events. It is only in the darkness of the truth revealed does one find rest and freedom in his work. One feels a holding back as far as the energy of the verse is concerned almost as if left unsaid with the will wanting.

The verses in ‘Contentment’, seem to distil the essence of this particular collection of poems in their revelation of life, discovery of the nether, dealing with it and moving on to a mundane regular living with a brilliance in even its lack of meaning. In that understanding does the poet gain his freedom. Let the truth of darkness be unfolded layer by layer in the escaping joys of the vision of positivity that life is a mirage of.

If you are looking for poetry as a lyric of a romantic imaginative soul to utopia this book is not for you. But if you have the courage to live life and face its beautiful, spellbinding greys then this might just be your call.



CP Surendran

‘Poetry Would be Written in a State of Helplessness’

CP Surendran tells Medha Dutta that the essential poet is one whose lines are written for him, but this happens once in a while in any poet’s life. An excerpt:



There seems to be a feeling of loss and melancholy running through most of your works in this collection.

Well, I am not sure about the melancholy part of it, as it is a coinage that gained currency, I believe, with the Romantic period. I am no great Romantic. The sense of loss though is real. And I think it might have a lot to do with a certain aspect of my childhood. In my case, the sense of loss—not unmixed with anger— is the constant feeling that I have betrayed the child in me, and perhaps in others.



Your first collection Gemini II has a clipped, terse, controlled tone to it. From there to Available Light, which has a personal view of the world, how do you think your writing has evolved?

The terseness you mention stems mostly from an unrelenting pursuit of the past; a dig and search operation. Not that one succeeded in the mission. The current crop of poems is relatively an outward journey primarily because they seem to reconcile to the possibility that the world outside the self is just as f****d up as the self.



In this age of instant coffee and WhatsApp messages, have we stopped enjoying poetry?

I believe it is not so much as enjoying poetry as a fierce disrespect ingrained in the perception of it. Poetry as we perceive it in India can be anything so long as the lines are short. The general result is a secret scorn and contempt in the higher circles of the literati. The bad name that poetry is stigmatised with is because of the proliferation of bad poets, an ill spread by the agency of social media, perhaps. Also, we have now instant poetry and flash fiction. These are jokes, of course. Because all you are trying to do is to be catchy, to cater to the flies teeming in the market with their all too brief attention spans.



In 2017, slam poetry made its strong presence felt in Indian metros. Do you think it’s here to stay?

Performance helps the reception of poetry. But performance could also be at the expense of poetry. I remember a lady with whom I shared a stage, reading utter drivel but in a most rousing way. The audience, especially women, was bowled over. Yet the poetry itself was just rhetoric. Slam poetry is here to stay; it’d be great if it does not slam poetry. I see the future of poetry closely associated with the internet. Podcasts, for example. But I am not sure if that takes away from the experience of hearing a good poet read his lines in real life.



Poetry finds few takers today. Is there a lack of mainstream publishers willing to publish poetry, a dwindling number of readers willing to buy it, or few bookshops ready to stock books of poetry?

At the risk of sounding contradictory, I believe there’s a rise in the audience. There is in fact a return of sorts. But very few publishers realise it. Bookshops tend not to store poetry collections simply because very few poets get media attention. The general fever is fiction and, now, non-fiction. Which is why I believe poetry would be written in a state of helplessness.","His experiences in the literary world and life in general seem to have seeped through the recesses of his poetry.

North-East comes closer,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/2018/mar/24/north-east-comes-closer-1791077.html,"Saturday, March 24, 2018 07:10 PM +0530","Sanjoy Hazarika is one of the most credible and authoritative voices on North-East India, that triangular stretch of land beyond what is known as the Chicken’s Neck. An award-winning journalist, formerly with the New York Times, Hazarika has written extensively about the North-East, a region which a majority, in what is known as ‘mainland India’, know little and understand even less so.

Strangers No More: New Narratives from India’s North-East is the latest from Hazarika following his earlier acclaimed works—Strangers of the Mist: Tales of War and Peace from India’s North-East and Rites of Passage: Border Crossings, Imagined Homelands, India‘s East and Bangladesh. In that sense, Strangers No More is truly “the most comprehensive book yet available about India’s North-East”, as the book’s blurb aptly says.

North-East is an extremely complex region, both geographically and culturally—“nearly 96 per cent of the region’s borders are with other countries; only 4 per cent of the border is connected to the rest of India”. Home to innumerable tribes, many of who do not trust the other, and immigrants from neighbouring regions who settled here over a century, the region is a complex anthropological mix. Add to this the fact that most borders in the region—both international and national—are disputed makes it more complicated.

Hazarika threads through these complexities with a discerning eye and an unbiased manner. He traces the history of the region to detail the issues plaguing the region and understand the aspirations of the people. Apart from shared ethnicities with neighbouring countries and China’s geo-political interests that makes the region a combustive political arena, one thing that comes out clearly in the book are the wrongly motivated and at time almost farcical Indian efforts to bring peace to the region.

The book details historical mistakes and current vested interests that have alienated the people in the region. Even 70 years after Independence, Indian authorities continue to be seen with mistrust. The reason is not difficult to understand—false promises by the authorities over decades, failure to resolve burning issues and almost constant use of Disturbed Areas Act in the region that has resulted in grave human rights violations.

The most vexatious issue has no doubt been rule by AFSPA. The free hand given to the armed, paramilitary and police forces in the region under AFSPA, dating back to 1958, has been the biggest impediment in the integration of the region with the rest of India. Hazarika brings out the horrors of the AFSPA rule through stories—from the much publicised shooting of Manorama and fast of Irom Sharmila to lesser known Ananda Kalita, who was shot in the head and yet miraculously survived, to Mohammed Azad Khan, a 12-year-old picked up from his home and beaten and shot in a rice field, to Felanee, a 15-year-old shot while she was trying to cross the barbed wire fence from India to Bangladesh.

Hazarika’s book is, in fact, a cry to remove AFSPA. It cites the trailblazing example of Tripura, which through “good governance” and “political tact” “turned the clock back by lifting the Disturbed Areas Act, which essentially ends AFSPA rule and sends the troops back to their barracks.” Therein lies the hope for the rest of the region.","Sanjoy Hazarika is one of the most credible and authoritative voices on North-East India, that triangular stretch of land beyond what is known as the Chicken’s Neck.

She is a scriptwriter, filmmaker, a researcher, and a transwoman based in Madurai, with a keen interest in interpreting histories of her community. Anyone familiar with her work would know that it shakes prejudices as we learn of transpersons’ lives in all fronts — from their duties as the queen’s apprentice during the Chola period, to their depiction in Bhakti literature. In an interview with CE, she talks about her upcoming film and its drive to show the stark presence of transgenders’ lives in Tamil history.

The idea for this documentary came when her previous film could not fully incorporate her research. “It was on transgender folk art in Tamil Nadu, which released in 2005. I had travelled across the state and collected a lot of information about the depiction of trans lives in Tholkapiam, Jeevakasintamani, Silapathikaram, and Bhakti literature,” she shares.

For about eight years after that, she collected books, and sought help from various centres including National Folklore Support Centre, Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department, Tanjavur Archaeology Department, Ramanathapuram Aranmanai, and centres in other parts of south Tamil Nadu.She shares that her inquisitiveness was new to the people she met, as she asked ‘What were transgender relationships like in the confines of a place?’ ‘What circles did they move in?’ ‘What positions of power did they hold?’ and more importantly, for her film, ‘How could she picturise these histories from the past?’

“I thought docu-drama would be more interesting, so we can explore the representation of their lives better. There are aranmanai scenes from Chola and Chera periods that have transpersons in decision-making positions,” she explains, adding that it is fully based on evidence.Most of the pre-production work for the docu-drama is complete, there’s a lot left to be done. She says that financial support has been

minimal so far, and most of it is volunteer driven. “Production costs are going to be high, and while the technical team is almost in place, we are yet to do a recce and auditions, and figure out the logistics,” she adds. To garner more support, a few months back, Priya launched an app called Idaiyinam. It informs people about the film, and ways to offer support to the team.

As she prepares for the poster release and shooting scheduled to start mid-April, she admits there have been many challenges. But being able to reclaim transgender histories, that was never erased in the first place, is the underlying intention of her work. “Mainstreaming our histories, and making others sensitive to our lives, is what keeps my work happy and going,” she shares.","She is a scriptwriter, filmmaker, a researcher, and a transwoman based in Madurai, with a keen interest in interpreting histories of her community.

Book review: A 'secular' Godse and a fallible Mahatma Gandhi,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/2018/mar/20/book-review-a-secular-godse-and-a-fallible-mahatma-gandhi-1789842.html,"Tuesday, March 20, 2018 01:06 PM +0530","Book: Why I Killed the Mahatma -- Uncovering Godse's Defence; Author: Koenraad Elst; Publisher: Rupa; Pages: 251

""History will be kind to me for I intend to write it,"" Winston Churchill had bragged with his trademark flourish, underlining the significant role which victors play in scripting the histories of their respective eras.

Koenraad Elst's provocatively titled book ""Why I killed the Mahatma..."", is a dissertation examining Gandhi's killer Nathuram Godse's defence in court during his trial, which eventually led to his hanging. And with this book, Elst, a Belgian Indologist, walks a path rarely trod on by other mainstream Indian historians, which involves the sensitive and precarious task of intellectualising Godse's rationale, which eventually led to the assassination.

Koenraad Elst's book 'Why I killed the Mahatma' (Photo | Amazon)

This is essential, according to Elst, who claims that a section of Indian historians have, for long, monopolised views on Gandhi's assassination, thereby eclipsing any other aspects linked to the saga which led to the Mahatma's killing, like Godse's point of view.

""The fact that he murdered the Mahatma has eclipsed every other fact in his fairly long and detailed statement. We hope that this study will enable the readers to see Godse with their own eyes rather than through the eyes of those who have thus far monopolised the discourse on the Mahatma's murder,"" Elst says, while pointing out to the significance of Godse's insistence on taking the absolute onus for the assassination, in an attempt to absolve his friends and other alleged conspirators.

Elst also attempts to bring out similar traits between the nearly anonymous (at the time) killer and his larger-than-life victim, like the similarities in their respective childhoods, when both believed in a supernatural sense. Godse, Elst says, as a child acted as the oracle of the family goddess, while Gandhi had invoked his inner voice to rational considerations right from a younger age.

""Logically following from the conviction, common to both Gandhi and Godse, that 'the problem of India was basically the problem of the Hindus', if there is another importance parallel: both were hard on their own Hindu society, not on Muslims,"" the author states in the book, which is bound to raise more than a few eyebrows.

Much like Gandhi, Elst maintains, Godse too refused to let Hindus lay the blame for their sufferings in the era preceding Independence and Partition elsewhere, but on themselves.

""It is remarkable that Godse, who profiles himself as a secular nationalist, puts a decisive part of the blame for the Pakistan movement on the British. He makes no attempt to link the contemporary phenomenon of Islamic separatism with the fundamental doctrines of Islam,"" a passage in the book reads.

Interestingly, the book also attempts to train the spotlight on what Elst prefers to call the secular side of Godse. The author claims that Godse swore by genuinely secular and democratic principles, so that all Indians should enjoy equal rights and complete equality on the basis of democracy and no special privileges on the basis of communal identity such as weightage in parliamentary representation of Muslims, something the ""so-called secularists"" of the era were in favour of.

""Congressites and leftist secularists, by contrast, supported communal representation and weightage back then, and still support separate Personal Law systems for different communities defined by religion today. If words still have a meaning, Godse's vision of independent India's polity was more secular than that of self-styled secularists,"" Elst claims in his book.

Elst also points out to what he suggests is an inconsistency in Gandhi's usage of fasting as a tool for bringing about peace, alleging that the Mahatma used the tool to good effect only with people who admired and loved him, and never against his opponents.

""For instance, he did not use this weapon in order to compel the Muslim League to give up its demand for Pakistan. Indeed, breaking a solemn promise, he failed to stake his life for the sake of India's unity,"" the book claims.

Elst's book is an attempt to provide an intellectual rationale for Godse's actions, while at the same time, not underlining the rights or the wrongs of the act of pumping bullets into the Mahatma, the first major and perhaps the most significant assassination in free India.

As contemporary India's political history changes course, such revisiting of past phenomena, occurrences and recording of an alternative discourse/s around them, may well trigger a new round of ideological churning.","Godse, Elst says, as a child acted as the oracle of the family goddess, while Gandhi had invoked his inner voice to rational considerations right from a younger age.

A mid-20th century French philosopher's lessons for our times,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/2018/mar/19/a-mid-20th-century-french-philosophers-lessons-for-our-times-1789312.html,"Monday, March 19, 2018 11:12 AM +0530","Globalisation's retreat and the consequent rise of a rather hyper form of nationalism -- which even seeks to confine indivisible human endeavours like art and science within borders -- is one of the most worrying trends of our time. Equally of concern is the trade-off between prosperity and liberty, and a sense of conformity being forced on us.



How do we face these challenges? One way would be to go back to the thoughts of a charismatic French existentialist philosopher -- the man who identified the ""absurd"" existence we find ourselves in, and suggested ways of escaping it.



But Albert Camus, who staunchly stood for human freedom beyond the constraints of ideology, and opposed totalitarianism of all types, had dealt with these issues in the last two decades of his tragically short life. And he expressed his views not only in his writings but also in public gatherings, from colleges to labour exchanges.



And in this installment of the thin, nearly-weightless, pocket-sized special edition of Penguin Modern Classics, we can hear Camus, who was noted for his incisive thought on serious issues of existence presented in a most accessible manner, deal with matters that were as important in his time as ours.



In ""Create Dangerously"", he dealt with the responsibility and the right of artists to their opinion against the backdrop of changing social and political dynamics and pressure -- a discourse that will strike a chord among Indian readers given the campaign against intolerance by many writers in the recent past.



Speaking at Sweden's ancient and prestigious Uppsala University in December 1957, a few days after he became the second-youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Camus, noting that writers attract criticism whether they speak or not, stressed they cannot -- and should not -- remain aloof.



Beginning in his inimitable style by citing the Oriental wise man's prayer to be spared from living in an exciting era, he quipped that none in the present age was spared as ""our era forces us to take an interest in it"".



Going on to show why this obligation of coming out of their comfort zone was necessary, he skilfully sketches out the major issues -- including the purpose of art, the artist's freedom and, especially, the attitude of the state.



The speech is also replete with key insights on related matters, including the relation between art and wealth, and of life and social purpose, the media through which forms of art are propagated, representation of life, artistic license, the comparative value of the nation and an individual and more that are still relevant now.



In ""Defence of Intelligence"", delivered in March 1945 at a meeting of a group seeking accord and amity in a just-liberated France -- even as the Second World War still raged, Camus made an eloquent plea against violence, hatred and the divisiveness they engendered.



Mincing no words at the barbarity they had just endured -- which he noted had also left its mark on the victims, some of whom retaliated in kind at the first chance -- he advocated curing ""poisoned hearts"" by ""saving one's intelligence"". And intelligence here is a sense of reason, discernment and objectivity, not mere mental capability.



And finally in ""Bread and Freedom"", delivered at a labour exchange in May 1953, Camus, who was a leftist but never condoned Stalinist excesses, made a blazing attack on totalitarianism.



Saying that if some trends continued, one could foresee ""a Europe of concentration camps"", where ""the only people at liberty will be prison guards who will then have to lock up one another"", he sought to nail the pernicious claim that if citizens have their basic, economic needs met, they do not require political liberty.



Though speeches delivered decades back but on issues that have again resurfaced due to our inability to learn from history, Camus proves he is a voice beyond his age by his prescient assessment of crucial matters and passionate but well-reasoned arguments. Hope we can learn from him now.

","Equally of concern is the trade-off between prosperity and liberty, and a sense of conformity being forced on us.
One way would be to go back to the thoughts of a charismatic French existentialist philosopher -- the man who identified the ""absurd"" existence we find ourselves in, and suggested ways of escaping it.
And he expressed his views not only in his writings but also in public gatherings, from colleges to labour exchanges.
And intelligence here is a sense of reason, discernment and objectivity, not mere mental capability.

Author Ravinder Singh wraps social messages with romance,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/2018/mar/19/author-ravinder-singh-wraps-social-messages-with-romance-1789112.html,"Monday, March 19, 2018 04:34 AM +0530","CHENNAI: Every person has a story to tell. Sometimes it ’s about love while at other times it’s about their sorrows. When Ravinder Singh decided to write his first book in 2007, after a tragic personal incident, little did he know he would write seven more books. He has authored books like I Too Had a Love Story, Can Love Happen Twice?, Like it happened Yesterday, Love Stories That Touched My Heart and Tell Me A Story. Ravinder was recently in the city to release his next titled Will You Still Love Me. We caught up with the author for a chat as he shared with us his journey, thoughts on Bollywood and why he writes love plays a crucial role in all his books.

Were you an avid reader?

I grew up in a remote area called Burla in Odisha. A small town, till today we don’t even have a traffic light there. I spent 24 years of my life there, and we didn't have one bookstore in my neighbourhood. So my exposure to books was limited, and I never read much except for my school textbooks.

Like many others, you too are an engineer-turned author. Why did you choose this path?

I think everyone has a lot of stories to tell, but I guess for an engineer there is so much more. From the preparations to cracking the exams and then those years in college...is in itself a story. I did my engineering and then my MBA as well, and here I am, an author.

Most of your books are on love.

I wrote my first book because of a personal tragedy and I walked the path to become an author. It was all about recalling memories I shared with my girlfriend who passed away. I would close my eyes, experience that moment; it was emotional but then it helped me heal in a way. But as far as my other works are concerned, I realised that once people enjoy a certain genre that you offer, there is a lot of acceptance you get as an author if you stick with the same. Although predominantly I don’t enjoy writing on the genre ‘romance’, my focus is always on the plot that I choose. For instance, the plot of one of my books was to make a young Indian gain interest in politics and it had to do with the Nirbhaya case. So this is the subject that I want to write about, where I used romance to wrap the story in. I realised that if I sugar coat my story with romance, the issues within it too will be read and becomes more interesting.

What inspires you to write each chapter?

Other authors and poets inspire me to write. I would just be sitting in the morning, sipping my cup of tea, reading a piece of poetry, and all of a sudden I feel inspired by the writing, regardless of the subject and language. I feel energised at that moment.

Do you plan to adapt your books into movies?

I am open to it, however, Bollywood is a difficult world. So many people have to be on the same page for something to happen. In case of a book, I am the director, writer, actor and everything. It is my story. So when it is being adapted into a movie, there will be so many people involved and it I have to ensure that the story’s essence shouldn’t be lost. I would be heartbroken to see my stories being played around with, because they are really close to my heart.","When Ravinder Singh decided to write his first book in 2007, after a tragic personal incident, little did he know he would write seven more books.
