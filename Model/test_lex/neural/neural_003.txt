Hewitt decries  career sexism Plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour s election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said 
Patricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an "increasingly high priority" and a "shared goal across government" 
Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) 
Mothers can currently take up to six months  paid leave  and six unpaid 
Ms Hewitt told the seminar: "Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months 
"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that "
Ms Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential 
The minister told delegates that getting rid of "career sexism" was vital to closing the gender pay gap 
"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex," she said 
Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4 s Today programme: "What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are lowpaid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment 
"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very oldfashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men 
"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men 
She added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures 
"The average woman working fulltime is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning 
The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC 
It has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies 
Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of "natural differences" between the sexes 
Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures 
And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average
