Watchdog probes email deletionsThe information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete emails more than three months old 
Richard Thomas "totally condemned" the deletion of emails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January 
Government guidance said emails should only be deleted if they served "no current purpose", Mr Thomas said 
The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules 
Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on email retention 
On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government emails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry 
The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was "too unlikely to have been a coincidence", Mr Beith said 
But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or "the destruction of important records" 
Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the "email regime" could "support the freedom of information regime" 
Mr Thomas said: "The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence "
He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of emails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor 
All emails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the email, said Mr Thomas 
"If in doubt retain, that has been the longstanding principle of the civil service and public authorities 
It s only when you ve got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it 
"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned "
The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year 
Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland 
It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions 
Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner
