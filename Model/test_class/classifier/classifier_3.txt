It may have happened to a lot of users when a file, image, document or a video sent to them on WhatsApp, get accidentally deleted 
In the latest beta version, Whatsapp now allows users to redownload deleted media from their servers again 
Known WhatsApp beta tester, WABetaInfo asserted that "Since a few days, WhatsApp allows downloading deleted media from their servers again 
This automatically translates into the fact that WhatsApp continues to store our media on their servers also after downloading them "
It was partially accessible before as well 
The files which were not downloaded were available for about 30 days and, when the recipient downloaded the media, the file would get deleted from WhatsApp server 
WhatsApp has modified this feature, “when a media is successfully downloaded, WhatsApp doesn’t delete it from the server, allowing the users to download it again if the file was accidentally deleted in the path where WhatsApp saves media ”During testing, files and videos received as early as two months back were easily downloaded and some even older files had to try multiple times in order to successfully redownload it, according to the report 
Media files continue to be endtoend encrypted
